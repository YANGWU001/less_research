    "\n\nHuman: Can you explain the differences between gas and induction stoves?\n\nAssistant: In gas stoves, the gas from the stove\u2019s tank comes out through the burners on the stovetop, and the resulting heat radiates back towards you. So if you were to put your hand over a gas stove burner, you would feel that the heat coming out is very warm, and the temperature is quite constant. If you put your hand closer to the burner, the temperature would go up, and if you moved your hand closer to the flame, it would feel very hot.\n\nOn the other hand, in induction stoves, the induction coil gets very hot, so that any kind of metal pan placed over it will heat up quickly. So if you were to put your hand on top of an induction stove, you would feel that the temperature isn\u2019t as warm, and the temperature would be much less constant. If you put your hand closer to the burner, the temperature would go up, and if you moved your hand closer to the flame, it would feel much hotter.\n\nHuman: I see. And is it true that you need to use different kinds of pots and pans if you buy an induction stove?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Most of the time, you can use any metal pan. However, if you are cooking something that has to be served really hot (such as pancakes, but not scrambled eggs, for example), then it might be a good idea to use a pan that has a protective bottom that is not susceptible to heat damage."
