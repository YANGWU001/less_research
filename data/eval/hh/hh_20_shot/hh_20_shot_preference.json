    "\n\nHuman: How do you steam carrots?\n\nAssistant: You can easily steam vegetables and other foods with a steamer pot, which sits on your stovetop.  You fill the pot with about an inch or two of water, and place it on the burner over high heat.  When the water boils, place the food in the steamer, cover with a lid, and reduce the heat to medium-low.  In most cases, the food will take about 5-10 minutes to cook, though you may have to check it a little more frequently if it\u2019s mostly tough or fibrous.  When the food is done steaming, drain the water and set the cover back on the pot to allow the food to stay warm.\n\nHuman: Can you steam carrots and broccoli together?\n\nAssistant: Yes, you can steam almost any food together!  Generally speaking, you should combine ingredients that take similar times to cook.  So, for example, you could steam broccoli and carrots together.  You should review the cooking times for both of your vegetables, and coordinate the dish so that everything is ready at the same time.\n\nHuman: Thanks!\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: What should you wear to go snow tubing?\n\nAssistant: Snow tubing is best done in the cold, where temperatures are below freezing.  Many places have snow tubing machines set up in a giant outdoor pond where you just go out in your snow pants and snow boots.  But you should put on a warm sweater as well, because you will be moving quickly, and the windchill can make it feel much colder than it actually is.  And if you have a coat or jacket you can also wear it.\n\nHuman: Do I need gloves or a hat?\n\nAssistant: It can be windy out there, so putting on a warm hat is probably a good idea.  Gloves may be a good idea as well, if you don\u2019t want to get your hands cold or dry them out.

    "\n\nHuman: Can you explain what rabies is?\n\nAssistant: Rhabdomyolysis is a muscle-wasting disease, usually caused by a brain infection, such as encephalitis. When a person is infected with the rabies virus, they develop inflammation of the brain, which causes weakness and ataxia, leading to rhabdomyolysis.\n\nHuman: How is rabies spread?\n\nAssistant: In people, the rabies virus is usually spread by bites from infected animals (canines). Infection can also be spread by saliva or nasal secretions from an infected animal. The disease has a high mortality rate (usually 100% of those infected) and a long incubation period (up to 1 year). The onset of symptoms is extremely fast (within 1 to 3 days) and the course of the disease is short (1 week). People who have been exposed to the virus, but who haven\u2019t shown symptoms, can still transmit rabies to others.\n\nHuman: Why is rabies so fatal?\n\nAssistant: Many animals have a strong immune response to the rabies virus, allowing them to recover. In humans, however, the virus uses the body\u2019s immune response to spread through the brain. It damages the brain and spinal cord, causing inflammation that damages the tissue and causes symptoms like fever, headache, and vomiting. As the virus attacks the brain and spinal cord, it damages the brain cells\u2019 ability to function, which makes the infected person unable to breathe on their own and ultimately die.\n\nHuman: What are symptoms of rabies?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: How do I make a decision between buying a house or renting?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a tough choice to make.  There are definitely pros and cons to both of these housing options.  If you\u2019re in a position to buy a house or a condo, then I would suggest you carefully analyze both the pros and cons of buying before making your decision.  Here are three main pros to buying a home:\n\n1.  A good, long-term investment: Buying a house typically results in a fairly significant decrease in your monthly mortgage payments, which can then be reinvested toward the eventual payoff of your housing purchase.\n\n2.  The feeling of home-ownership: Owning a home can really contribute to the feeling of satisfaction and comfort, as you\u2019re able to customize your home to your own preferences, decorate how you like, and know that the house will belong to you for years to come.\n\n3.  Tax benefits: In some cases, homeowners may be able to deduct certain mortgage expenses from their income taxes.  In some counties, homeowners may also qualify for property tax benefits and thus see an overall decrease in their tax burden compared to renters.\n\nThere are, however, several downsides to buying a home:\n\n1.  Risk of a huge price\n\nHuman: Can you elaborate on the downsides of home ownership?\n\nAssistant: Sure, here are a few more downsides:\n\n2.

    "\n\nHuman: Can you safely have a baby at home?\n\nAssistant: It is possible to safely give birth at home with the assistance of a trained professional. However, only a very small percentage of families choose this option. If you are thinking about giving birth at home consult with your health care provider for guidance on the best decision for your family. The process for home birth requires considerable planning and should be undertaken with a trained professional. Regular visits and ongoing communication with your health care provider are essential to ensure a safe and healthy delivery. Giving birth at home or birthing centers is often costlier than delivery through hospitals, may involve more travel time for the mother and birthing team, and may require additional support and expertise of medical personnel.\n\nFor most healthy women human birthing through the vaginal route is a safe process and is associated with a number of known benefits for both mothers and babies. Mothers who choose home birth are less likely to need anesthesia or cesarean sections (C-section), and can enjoy greater control of the birthing environment and the birthing process. Home birth is believed to facilitate more caring and support during labor and birth, and studies show that birthing at home is associated with fewer complications and lower rates of hysterectomy, C-section, and pain medication use.

    "\n\nHuman: When someone has \"plastic surgery\" on their face, does that mean that they actually had plastic inserted into their face to make the changes to their appearance? Why do they call it that?\n\nAssistant: Plastic surgery refers to any kind of surgery that changes a person\u2019s appearance, by changing the structure of the face or body.  So yes, it usually involves actually inserting plastic into the body in some way, to reshape the features or add or remove skin and tissue.  Plastic surgery got its name because originally the plastic implants were made of plastic, but now they are usually made of other materials like mesh or soft tissue.  The term has just stuck, even though the actual materials used have changed.  Does that make sense?  Hope it helps!\n\nHuman: Well, what did they call it before they used those materials?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " In the early days they just called it \u201cplastic surgery\u201d, but previously it was called \u201ccosmetic surgery\u201d.  Cosmetic surgery is just surgery that changes a person\u2019s appearance rather than treating some medical condition.  So they originally just called it plastic surgery because the implants used were made of plastic, but the term is still used even though the implants are made of different materials now.  Does that make sense?  Sorry it\u2019s a bit complicated!  Hope it helps.",
            " Before plastic surgery got its name, they just called it surgery to change a person\u2019s appearance. Maybe cosmetic surgery or aesthetic surgery.  In the early 20th century, when plastic materials were first used for implantation in the body, they were looked at as very novel and advanced, so that\u2019s why they got the name plastic surgery.  But the actual techniques used in surgery have been around for a long time, they are just using different materials.  Does that make sense?  Hope it helps!  :)"

    "\n\nHuman: I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting. I am interested in trying some Lithuanian dishes. Can you give me a recipe for Kold\u016bnai?\n\nAssistant: I am not sure about Lithuanian cuisine, so I will show you what we have available in English. Here is a recipe for Kold\u016bnai:\n\n1.3 cups of flour\n1.5 teaspoons of salt\n1 cup of butter\n2 tablespoons of granulated sugar\n2 eggs\n5 teaspoons of vanilla\n1 cup of chopped walnuts\n1 egg yolk\nI would recommend using non-hydrogenated vegetable shortening for the dough. It is best to mix the dough by hand. When the dough is the right consistency, add the sugar and egg yolk, and continue kneading. Once the dough is soft and smooth, knead in the vanilla and the walnuts.  \nThe dough can be stored in the fridge for up to two weeks, and baked when needed.\n\nHuman: Kold\u016bnai is actually just a stuffed dumpling.\n\nAssistant:": {

Add the eggs one at a time and mix in the salt. Knead until the dough is smooth and put aside.\n\n2. Take a portion of the dough and put a tablespoon of flour on it and roll out the dough to a circle about the size of a tablespoon. Put a spoonful of filling in the middle of the circle and spread it out. Fold the circle in half and pinch the edges together. Now repeat these steps until the dough is gone.",
