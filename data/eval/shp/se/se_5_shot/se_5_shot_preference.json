    "\n\nHuman: <p>One of my colleagues at my institution, Prof. A, is the editor of a journal, Journal X, (and I am not involved in the journal in any way). I received an email by a professor, Prof. B, who had submitted two articles to Journal X and accuses Prof. A. of intentionally delaying the publication of these articles by not handling them properly. Prof. B claims that Prof. A did not answer his queries per email and that another editor of Journal X also did not answer his emails. The email I got from Prof. B was openly targeted to several other colleagues at my institution and also to a number of other people I do not know and also to Prof A. At the end of his email, Prof. B asks me (and the others - more or less verbatim) \"Is this attitude of Prof. A normal or are there any unethical elements [...]?\" and to \"join in this story\". </p>\n\n<p>I found it disturbing that Prof. B wrote such an email to such an audience and I would say that his way of addressing the situation was not ok. However, I wonder what my reaction should be. Normally, I would just stop by at Prof. A's office, but I am on sabbatical leave so this is not an option. I do not know more details about the issue of the publication, but I think that these do not really matter in this case, as I only want to ask about what I should do:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Should I answer Prof. B that this way of addressing the issue was not ok?</li>\n<li>Should I inform Prof. A that I found this email inappropriate?</li>\n<li>Should I just act as if I haven't read this email?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I would especially appreciate answers from people with experience on an editorial board, but other guiding comments are also helpful.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

But I think it is perfectly okay not to respond. First of all, you are one of a long list of recipients, so it would be quite unreasonable for Prof. B to expect each and every recipient of the email to set aside their work and life to dedicate themselves to studying in detail the situation he is describing and then write an equally detailed reply. Basically, to put it bluntly, Prof. B's email can be reasonably classified as spam and there is certainly no obligation to reply to it in any way.</p>\n\n<p>Second of all, you are on sabbatical, which is a sacred time you should devote to nurturing your own interests and passions and ignoring the daily trivia and tedium of academic life. The case for not responding is therefore even stronger (to the extent it needed any strengthening). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Should I inform Prof. A that I found this email inappropriate?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, you have been implicated in this business completely through the actions of others and have no duty to take any action.

But there is absolutely no need to do so.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Should I just do as if I haven't read this email?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wouldn't falsely pretend that I haven't read the email, if that's what you mean - that would be dishonest and unprofessional (and besides, you have now documented publicly your knowledge of the email ;-)). Nor would I plan on saying (as Wolfgang Bangerth suggests in his answer) that I deleted it since it was \"none of my business\" (I don't think that unethical behavior by others is none of my business - it would be perfectly appropriate to consider it my business if I were so inclined). But as I said it would be completely appropriate to file the email away (or delete it, as you prefer) and take no further action. Whether you <em>should</em> do that depends on whether you are interested in getting involved in the story.</p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I am about to finish an undergraduate degree, with a good enough GPA that even if I got C's in all of my current classes, my final overall cumulative GPA would remain above 3.6.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming I graduate with all the whistles in my diploma it would be:</p>\n\n<p>Honours Bachelors of science in computer science with distinction and a minor in pure mathematics (quite pompous).</p>\n\n<p>In order to complete all of those whistles I had to do supervised research for two semesters. Being a naive undergraduate, I knocked on proffessor's doors, asking for a supervisor, and one of them, very generously agreed. He suggested a problem I thought was interesting and so I started the research. I originally started throwing analysis at the problem, and started trying to solve some really complex differential equations (which kept me motivated). However I did not make much progress, so after my supervisor marked that I needed to get something, I fully changed my approach and started using some geometric approximations to solve the issue. This generated some results, but was too simple. I'd like to say that my results were inversely proportional to how much effort I was putting in the research.</p>\n\n<p>Time passed, I had multiple potential solutions and a way to evaluate them. On the last week before the final submission I realised there was a bug in my code base that was destroying the results (they were mathematically impossible). I tried to find the error, but the best I could do was identify an area where a mistake could have happened. </p>\n\n<p>Finally I got my evaluation on the course after presenting it. The feedback said the methods were a bit naive and could be improved on, and it was dissapointing that I didn't get numerical results (I had visual results, not numerical), however since I was not a seasoned researcher they decided to be lenient and gave me an A anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I applied to the grad program at my university, and asked the same proffessor to be my supervisor for the grad program. I am in desperate need of financial support until the grad program starts, and so my supervisor said I could do summer research for him and in the meanwhile we could discuss what the grad project could be. What he wants me to do is finish my previous work and get a publication. </p>\n\n<p>The issue is that I legitimately feel that dinking bleach would be more motivating (I am using this metaphor to convey just how much anxiety this is giving me). This research really does not appeal to me in any way or form, and the interesting part is over, all that is missing is finding the bug, which could take more than two weeks to solve and implementing a couple of modifications to make my naive methods less naive if things go well, or complete failure to finish it in the worst case.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to that I have been doing independent research simultaneously as I have been taking courses and doing everything else. Although this independent research still needs a lot of work, it's in a good place, I have already improved many of the papers I have read and have multiple ideas to explore. In an ideal world I would win the lottery tomorrow and I could just support myself while I carry on with this research.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure how to approach my supervisor and tell him I don't want to finish this research, nor how to suggest to do my research instead and get a publication out of that, or even if I should touch on this topic at all.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

I have tried everything suggested in every post I've been able to find and none have worked consistently long term.  Yesterday I stumbled on a dumb solution that is working just fine.  When the Mac wakes and the screens are switched, I click the &quot;Cancel&quot; &quot;X&quot; at the bottom of the screen asking for the passcode.  this puts it back in sleep mode.  Then I hit the space bar to wake it again and it usually goes back to the original configuration.  A couple of times I have had to do this a second or third time to get it to switch but in every case it has been much easier than going through the multiple windows (more now with the latest iOS update) to rearrange them.  I still get all the open windows piled up on one screen so it isn't a perfect solution, just an easier hack to try.  I hope it works for you.</p>\n"

            " <p>This is what happened:</p>\n\n<p>Wubi uses the Windows boot manager to load it, even if it's on a separate partition.

Wubi stores your OS in a virtual hard disk file.  It's possible that it could be extracted to a separate partition and booted.  BUT that's a little complex and you might run into some issues because of the way it's set up.  So, here's something you can do:</p>\n\n<p>Boot up an Ubuntu LiveCD or USB that is the same architecture (32- or 64-bit) and version as your Wubi install.  (I assume you already know how to do this, but just in case you didn't use the LiveCD earlier run <code>sudo gparted</code> to edit partitions easily).  Tell it to look for a lost partition or partitions.  <strong>As long as you have not written to the space where it was, your data will still be there.</strong>  Now, you can run Startup repair for Windows to automatically restore the boot sector of the partition, and voila!  You should be able to boot your Wubi install once again.</p>\n\n<p>If you <strong>have</strong> written to the partition space, try making a new NTFS partition with the same size and dimensions of the previous one and running file recovery.  For instance:</p>\n\n<p>Boot up Hiren's Boot CD and start the Windows XP option.  Then, install Piriform's Recuva and look for C:\\boot.ini.  Once you have that copied to a flash drive, install Windows again and copy that file over the new boot.ini.

            " <p>Wubi uses Grub4dos to boot. Usually grub4dos is <code>grldr.mbr</code> and <code>grldr</code>. The first bit is small as it is a bootloader and the second bit contains the code that won't fit into the MBR. With Wubi it uses <code>wubildr.mbr</code> and <code>wubildr</code>. These are the same as the grldr* files but renamed.</p>\n\n<p>What you are seeing is <code>wubildr.mbr</code> looking for <code>wubildr</code> on all partitions, and then after not finding it, it issues the message \"<em>ERROR: Cannot find GRLDR in all devices: Press ctrl+alt+delete to restart</em>\". That's an unfortunate hardcoded message that should read \"<em>ERROR: Cannot find WUBILDR in all devices: Press ctrl+alt+delete to restart</em>\". So you probably deleted the <code>C:</code> partition and the <code>C:\\wubildr</code> that was there. Just copy it (there's a <code>wubildr</code> in the <code>\\ubuntu\\winboot</code> directory) into the root of any partition and it should work again.</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>My character is a soldier and doesn't have a good regenerative shield like the one used by krypton321 in the YouTube video. I am able to get around 50% of the armor down and then both my squad mates die. I had no med gel to start with, so that is another problem. Once the squad mates die, it gets harder to take the barrier down as well. What I have done so far is to run around the platform and then take a few shots. </p>\n\n<p>A good shield would have been helpful. I think the soldier option was not very smart. Without a good shield, collector ship is going to be a problem as well. </p>\n\n<p>Edit: I finished Horizon. Same strategy. Needed to run around the platform. Cannot expect much from the squad. I had Garrus and Mordin as squad mates. Mordin was useful to bring the armor down with incineration as long he was alive. Around 75% armor both of them died. I used rifle and heavy reave until the armor was close to 25% and then used the collector particle beam to take out the rest. Died way too many times. Key is to run from cover to cover and never get caught on the inside. Don't wait for the praetorian to get too close or you will take heavy damage if you don't have a good shield. </p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: On the collector ship now. Completed 4 loyalty missions without any problem (Miranda, Jacob, Mordin and Grunt in that order). The ambush part doesn't look good at all. Died a few times already. May be I will try next weekend. </p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: After 2 hours of trying I gave up on the collector ship as soldier. I also kept seeing the message \"Sentinels are nearly indestructible. Tech armor gives additional layer of protection...\". So I started a sentinel career on insanity difficulty. So far it has been good. I completed the horizon fairly easily as well because I could restore my shields often. Hopefully that will help on collector ship. </p>\n\n<p>Edit 4: I have completed the collector ship with Miranda and Jack. Grunt kept dying. Tech armor helped a lot. </p>\n\n<p>Edit 5: I have completed the game on insanity. Completing all loyalty missions helped with the upgrades necessary for the final battle. It wasn't hard with all that heavy damages. Took grunt and legion along at collector base because they have shields. Too many harbingers while fighting the reaper though. Used legions combat drones to distract the harbinger. Had armor piercing ammo (tungsten rounds) as the power. Again, thanks to the tech armor. </p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: <p>According to Newton's third law, whenever objects A and B interact with each other, they exert equal and opposite forces upon each other.

Consider a segment of rope from which a  mass is suspended in Atwood's Machine.  That segment will experience a force $m1g$ from the weight. People say this weight is the reason for the counterforce in that segment, and that this force will travel all the way through the rope to the other segment resulting in a uniform tension.  If this is correct then I can see the uniform tension around the rope as an application of newton's third law but the fact  that this resulted from the weight negates the third law and also this will mean that m1=m2 where m1 and m2 are the masses at each segment\n  ...can somebody explain this to me</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

So if you think of an electron as a wave, you can think of it kind of like a wave of water going through two slits, it will create an interference pattern on the screen. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoQYnhHQ95U\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here is a video hosted by Brian Greene that gives it a good visual.</a></p>\n",
            " <p>To say a substantially similar thing to the existing answers in very different words, quantum mechanics is now known to be a deeply nonlocal theory: you cannot carve the world up into subsystems moving around and containing hidden classical information obeying a classical probability model, without allowing that information to affect other information in other subsystems instantaneously at a distance.</p>\n<p>It is a &quot;relativistic&quot; nonlocality, which means that the nonlocality can only be observed in correlations between two different experiments but those experiments' results need to be brought back together (by classical processes) into one place to detect that nonlocality. This forbids using QM to observably transfer information any faster than the speed of light. Sometimes this is explicit, so for example in &quot;quantum teleportation&quot; one party must send a couple bits of classical information to the other party for them to &quot;descramble&quot; the teleported state and then use it normally.</p>\n<p>When Feynman says that the double slit experiment contains the heart of quantum mechanics, I think this is really what he is driving at. He is saying that this aspect of nonlocality is present even here. So for example the pilot-wave interpretations of quantum mechanics have the particle go through one or the other of the slits, but the fact that it <em>could</em> have gone through the other causes its pilot wave to pass through the other slit, and the interference on the pilot wave causes the electron to not hit the various &quot;dead zones&quot; on the detector screen. The pilot wave is itself a manifestation of this nonlocality, the electron goes through one slit but it can nonlocally &quot;see&quot; that the other slit was available to go through.</p>\n<p>My favorite demonstration of this nonlocality is a game for a team of 3 people to try to beat us scientists. We, the people setting up the game, split the team into 3 rooms and then either set up a &quot;control round&quot; where the three are all given the same goal, call it Goal A, or &quot;betrayal rounds&quot; where one person is given this goal A but the other two are told to accomplish the opposite, call it Goal B, so that the one person is unwittingly &quot;betraying&quot; the other two because they have the wrong information about the goal. The 3-person team has to somehow detect and correct for this &quot;traitor&quot; if they want to win the round and accomplish the &quot;true&quot; goal B; but we can relativistically separate the rooms so that they cannot classically communicate with each other. Classical teams can satisfy at most 3 of 4 possible equations, so if we set up those 4 possibilities to be equally likely, they can only win a maximum of 75% of the time. Teams who share a quantum state can cooperate to win the game 100% of the time in theory -- today they would be limited sharply by our ability to keep these delicate &quot;entangled states&quot; truly &quot;coherent&quot; in ways that would allow them to actually win 100% of the time.</p>\n<p>But the point is, we know the classical picture quite exhaustively; the classical picture of probability allows you to transform the above problem into one where we say to all three team members separately, &quot;okay if we gave you goal A what would you answer? and if we gave you goal B what would you answer?&quot; and then afterwards look at all four setups AAA, ABB, BAB, BBA and choose each one with a 25% probability, and we would have a 25% chance of hitting the one that they did not choose. The experimental-setup choice of &quot;what situation are we setting up?&quot; can &quot;commute&quot; with the &quot;what is your strategy?&quot; choice. In quantum mechanics, this commutation cannot happen in this way.</p>\n",
            " <p>In the ensemble interpretation the wave function describes an ensemble of particles rather than a single one. Some electrons go  through one slit and others through the other. It does not solve the mystery of the wave function and the probabilistic nature of QM, but it avoids this and similar paradoxes.</p>\n",
            " <p>A wave function is not a particle until it is detected.</p>\n<p>The wave function relates to the relative likelihood of detecting the particle at each point &amp; time.</p>\n<p>Whereas a wave function is spread out in both space and time, a particle can have a definite position or momentum at a given moment.</p>\n<p>So, the electron does not divide.  The wave function divides.  The wavefunction behaves as a wave and so can pass through both slits- as long as the detection method leaves the trajectory of the electron indeterminate.</p>\n",
            " <p>An electron is a particle with wave properties.  The electron does not split into 2 parts ... it chooses one slit or the other.  The wave properties are a result of the EM field which influences all charge particle trajectories. It is the wave property that results in the banding (not the interaction of 2 electrons in some kind of superposition).</p>\n<p>IMO the electron behaves similarly to Feynman interpretation of a photon in the DSE. Thus the electron is most likely to travel a path length n times its wavelength....and this in turn allows/favours certain paths while disallowing others.  The emitting atom/electron field combined with the receiving atom/electrons field are optimal for optimal path length.</p>\n",
            " <p>It takes an aura of mystery to get enough attention. The interpretation of the double-slit experiment is such a thing. &quot;It is beyond our imagination, it is quantum mechanical&quot; is the wonderful sentence that makes us think and always ask questions.</p>\n<p>The answer of PhysicsDave is the one that is different from the other answers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The electron does not split into 2 parts ... it chooses one slit or the other. The wave properties are a result of the EM field which influences all charge particle trajectories. It is the wave property that results in the banding (not the interaction of 2 electrons in some kind of superposition).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the key. You have the electron with its electric and its magnetic field and you have the edge (of the slit(s)) with its field.To understand it, remember that under certain technical circumstances we are able to couple EM radiation into the skin surface of a material and obtain <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_plasmon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">surface plasmons</a>. What you get are surface plasmon polariton waves, and these waves can exit the material and radiate again.</p>\n<p>The wonderful mystery of the slit experiments includes the refusal to consider alternatives. The alternative is simple. The particle interacts with the edge region in a quantized way and the deflections lead to the intensity distribution on the screen.</p>\n<p>More information can be found in the answer to the question <a href=\"https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/144339/how-does-huygens-principle-explain-interference\">How does the Huygens principle explain interference?</a>.</p>\n"

            " <p><strong>CDR Overview</strong></p>\n\n<p>CDR (Content Disarm and Reconstruction) describes the process of creating a safe copy of an original file by including only the safe elements from the original file, as defined by the document manufacturer (e.g. Adobe for PDF, MSFT for Word etc.). </p>\n\n<p><strong>CDR Advantages</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>High Security \n\n<ul>\n<li>Protects from known and unknown attacks.</li>\n<li>Deterministic \u2013 Since the system works based on a predefined list of file elements, the reconstructed files are 100% safe. Diversions from the expected format specifications (exploits) or unsafe elements, are not included in the reconstructed document.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>High Usability\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fast \u2013 Processing a file usually takes less than a second. Longer processing times will still be substantially faster than alternatives.</li>\n<li>File Types and Size \u2013 Supports all commonly used formats and some non-standards, can process any file size.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>CDR Disadvantages</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>In order to ensure safety, CDR disables or removes active content and executable elements from the input file. This includes macros / scripts and embedded executables. This functionality is fully policy controlled and can be disabled for certain users in the organization by specifying exclusions (e.g. different levels of CDR for different user groups)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Sandbox Overview</strong></p>\n\n<p>A Sandbox is a security mechanism that detects malicious behavior in files. It does so by allowing the file to run in a controlled environment and observing its activity.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Sandbox Advantages</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Examines the outcome instead of the code - Can detect new versions of known attacks regardless of any changes made to the delivery mechanism.</p></li>\n<li><p>Works on virtually all files types (with the right configuration) and components.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Sandbox Disadvantages</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>May be evaded in some cases \u2013 Modern malicious programs often attempt to detect the sandboxing environment. They either try to detect markers of the virtual environment (e.g. p-fish testing) or perform a simple CAPTCHA (a simple challenge-response test to determine whether or not the user is human) before misbehaving. The malicious software may act like a legitimate software when running in the sandbox environment, but act maliciously when detecting that it\u2019s running on a \u201creal\u201d user\u2019s computer.</p></li>\n<li><p>Usability \u2013 </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Latency \u2013 Many sandbox solutions state that processing time (for files that weren\u2019t previously processed) may take more than two minutes. Users often find this disturbing in some environments (e.g. email).</li>\n<li>File Size Limit \u2013 in order to ensure performance, some sandbox solutions place a limit on the maximum file size that can be scanned (as low as 60MB on some systems). </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Cost and Scalability - Sandboxes are difficult to scale. The amount of resources required (more than 1 minute of a full VM per file) may pose a challenge when using it to fully-secure large environments. \u2003</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>The Ideal Solution - Combining the Two</strong></p>\n\n<p>In order to enjoy the benefits of both worlds, it is recommended to combine both systems. CDR will protect from known and unknown threats and will allow scale and speed; A sandbox will manage executables and active content. \nThis allows the sandbox to work only on files that were not treated by CDR, thus lowering volume and increasing its processing time efficiency. As most organizational traffic consists of non-executable documents, this method can reduced sandbox load by 90% - 95%, lowering the total costs and improving the average latency.</p>\n",

This means trying to get the private key of the CA from the certificates it issued is no problem in practice, no matter how many certificates where issued. </p>\n\n<p>Still, (sub-)CA certificates will be renewed from time to time too because they were expired or because the signature algorithm used to sign the CA is deemed unsafe.</p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Environment: SP2010 Enterprise, VS2012</p>\n\n<p>I've been using C# to programmatically create alerts for various users and implementing the alert.Filter property to assign filters that point to specific directories. It's simple enough to create a variable for the path to insert into the filter, but when it comes to the username, passing a variable in its place does not seem to work using any method I have tried. CAML (or at least the pseudo-CAML used in filters) likes the user's name to actually be the name <strong>field</strong> (in this case, pulled from AD) not the <strong>account</strong> name. So after a little playing around I figured out how to turn that into a variable to pass into the filter like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>string userName = vUser.Name;\nstring oFilter = (\"&lt;Query&gt;&lt;And&gt;&lt;Or&gt;&lt;Eq&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='ItemFullUrl'/&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + fullPath + \"&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Eq&gt;&lt;BeginsWith&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='ItemFullUrl'/&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + fullPath + \"/&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/BeginsWith&gt;&lt;/Or&gt;&lt;Neq&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + userName + \"&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='Editor/New'/&gt;&lt;/Neq&gt;&lt;/And&gt;&lt;/Query&gt;)\");\noAlert.Filter = oFilter;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The user.Name property outputs a name that matches the format in the CAML filter of a working alert I examined. If I type the name directly into the filter it works fine, but when I try to pass it as a variable it breaks, even if I explicitly set the variable to \"User Name\".</p>\n\n<p>Is there some part of how the filter/string works that I'm not accounting for? Every search I've done online has said this method should work, in theory. My goal is simply to make the alert apply only to changes made by other users, is there perhaps another way to accomplish that?</p>\n\n<p>Any advice is greatly appreciated!</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

Its author has done a few really good presentations on the topic that you can find on youtube.</p>\n",
            " <p>To expand on @KarlBielefeldt's answer, here's a full example of how to implement <em>Vectors</em> - lists with a statically-known number of elements - in Haskell. Hold on to your hat...</p>\n\n<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE ExistentialQuantification #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE DeriveFoldable #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE DeriveTraversable #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE KindSignatures #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE StandaloneDeriving #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}\n\nimport Prelude hiding (foldr, zipWith)\nimport qualified Prelude\nimport Data.Type.Equality\nimport Data.Foldable\nimport Data.Traversable\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see from the long list of <code>LANGUAGE</code> directives, this'll only work with a recent version of GHC.</p>\n\n<p>We need a way of representing lengths within the type system. By definition, a natural number is either zero (<code>Z</code>) or it's the successor of some other natural number (<code>S n</code>). So, for example, the number 3 would be written <code>S (S (S Z))</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>data Nat = Z | S Nat\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With the <a href=\"http://dreixel.net/research/pdf/ghp.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">DataKinds extension</a>, this <code>data</code> declaration introduces a <em>kind</em> called <code>Nat</code> and two <em>type</em> constructors called <code>S</code> and <code>Z</code> - in other words we have <em>type-level</em> natural numbers. Note that the types <code>S</code> and <code>Z</code> don't have any member values - only types of kind <code>*</code> are inhabited by values.</p>\n\n<p>Now we introduce a <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/GADT\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GADT</a> representing vectors with a known length. Note the kind signature: <code>Vec</code> requires a type <em>of kind <code>Nat</code></em> (ie a <code>Z</code> or an <code>S</code> type) to represent its length.</p>\n\n<pre><code>data Vec :: Nat -&gt; * -&gt; * where\n    VNil :: Vec Z a\n    VCons :: a -&gt; Vec n a -&gt; Vec (S n) a\nderiving instance (Show a) =&gt; Show (Vec n a)\nderiving instance Functor (Vec n)\nderiving instance Foldable (Vec n)\nderiving instance Traversable (Vec n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The definition of vectors is similar to that of linked lists, with some extra type-level information about its length. A vector is either <code>VNil</code>, in which case it has a length of <code>Z</code>(ero), or it's a <code>VCons</code> cell adding an item to another vector, in which case its length is one more than the other vector (<code>S n</code>). Note that there's no constructor argument of type <code>n</code>. It's just used at compile time to track lengths, and will be erased before the compiler generates machine code.</p>\n\n<p>We've defined a vector type which carries around static knowledge of its length. Let's query the type of a few <code>Vec</code>s to get a feel for how they work:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; :t (VCons 'a' (VCons 'b' VNil))\n(VCons 'a' (VCons 'b' VNil)) :: Vec ('S ('S 'Z)) Char  -- (S (S Z)) means 2\nghci&gt; :t (VCons 13 (VCons 11 (VCons 3 VNil)))\n(VCons 13 (VCons 11 (VCons 3 VNil))) :: Num a =&gt; Vec ('S ('S ('S 'Z))) a  -- (S (S (S Z))) means 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The dot product proceeds just as it would for a list:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-- note that the two Vec arguments are declared to have the same length\nvap :: Vec n (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Vec n a -&gt; Vec n b\nvap VNil VNil = VNil\nvap (VCons f fs) (VCons x xs) = VCons (f x) (vap fs xs)\n\nzipWith :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; Vec n a -&gt; Vec n b -&gt; Vec n c\nzipWith f xs ys = fmap f xs `vap` ys\n\ndot :: Num a =&gt; Vec n a -&gt; Vec n a -&gt; a\ndot xs ys = foldr (+) 0 $ zipWith (*) xs ys\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>vap</code>, which 'zippily' applies a vector of functions to a vector of arguments, is <code>Vec</code>'s applicative <code>&lt;*&gt;</code>; I didn't put it in an <code>Applicative</code> instance because <a href=\"https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/pub/hasochism.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">it gets messy</a>. Note also that I'm using the <code>foldr</code> from the compiler-generated instance of <code>Foldable</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Let's try it out:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; let v1 = VCons 2 (VCons 1 VNil)\nghci&gt; let v2 = VCons 4 (VCons 5 VNil)\nghci&gt; v1 `dot` v2\n13\nghci&gt; let v3 = VCons 8 (VCons 6 (VCons 1 VNil))\nghci&gt; v1 `dot` v3\n&lt;interactive&gt;:20:10:\n    Couldn't match type \u2018'S 'Z\u2019 with \u2018'Z\u2019\n    Expected type: Vec ('S ('S 'Z)) a\n      Actual type: Vec ('S ('S ('S 'Z))) a\n    In the second argument of \u2018dot\u2019, namely \u2018v3\u2019\n    In the expression: v1 `dot` v3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Great! You get a compile-time error when you try to <code>dot</code> vectors whose lengths don't match.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Here's an attempt at a function to concatenate vectors together:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-- This won't compile because the type checker can't deduce the length of the returned vector\n-- VNil +++ ys = ys\n-- (VCons x xs) +++ ys = VCons x (concat xs ys)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The length of the output vector would be the <em>sum</em> of the lengths of the two input vectors. We need to teach the type checker how to add <code>Nat</code>s together. For this we use a <a href=\"https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Type_families\" rel=\"noreferrer\">type-level function</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>type family (n :: Nat) :+: (m :: Nat) :: Nat where\n    Z :+: m = m\n    (S n) :+: m = S (n :+: m)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This <code>type family</code> declaration introduces a <em>function on types</em> called <code>:+:</code> - in other words, it's a recipe for the type checker to calculate the sum of two natural numbers. It's defined recursively - whenever the left operand is greater than <code>Z</code>ero we add one to the output and reduce it by one in the recursive call. (It's a good exercise to write a type function which multiplies two <code>Nat</code>s.) Now we can make <code>+++</code> compile:</p>\n\n<pre><code>infixr 5 +++\n(+++) :: Vec n a -&gt; Vec m a -&gt; Vec (n :+: m) a\nVNil +++ ys = ys\n(VCons x xs) +++ ys = VCons x (concat xs ys)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's how you use it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; VCons 1 (VCons 2 VNil) +++ VCons 3 (VCons 4 VNil)\nVCons 1 (VCons 2 (VCons 3 (VCons 4 VNil)))\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So far so simple. What about when we want to do the opposite of concatenation and split a vector in two? The lengths of the output vectors depend on the runtime value of the arguments. We'd like to write something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-- this won't work because there aren't any values of type `S` and `Z`\n-- split :: (n :: Nat) -&gt; Vec (n :+: m) a -&gt; (Vec n a, Vec m a)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but unfortunately Haskell won't let us do that. Allowing the <em>value</em> of the <code>n</code> argument to appear in the <em>return type</em> (this is commonly called a <em>dependent function</em> or <em>pi type</em>) would require \"full-spectrum\" dependent types, whereas <code>DataKinds</code> only gives us promoted type constructors.

Now use <code>testEquality</code> to determine whether those lengths are equal. If they are, we'll have <code>Just Refl</code>; <code>gcastWith</code> will use that equality proof to ensure that <code>dot u v</code> is well-typed by discharging its implicit <code>n ~ m</code> assumption.</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; let v1 = fromList [1,2,3]\nghci&gt; let v2 = fromList [4,5,6]\nghci&gt; let v3 = fromList [7,8]\nghci&gt; dot' v1 v2\nJust 32\nghci&gt; dot' v1 v3\nNothing  -- they weren't the same length\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that, since a vector without static knowledge of its length is basically a list, we've effectively re-implemented the list version of <code>dot :: Num a =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; Maybe a</code>. The difference is that this version is implemented in terms of the vectors' <code>dot</code>. Here's the point: before the type checker will allow you to call <code>dot</code>, <strong>you must have tested</strong> whether the input lists have the same length using <code>testEquality</code>. I am prone to getting <code>if</code>-statements the wrong way round, but not in a dependently-typed setting!</p>\n\n<p>You can't avoid using existential wrappers at the edges of your system, when you're dealing with runtime data, but you can use dependent types everywhere inside your system and keep the existential wrappers at the edges, when you perform input validation.</p>\n\n<p>Since <code>Nothing</code>is not very informative, you could further refine the type of <code>dot'</code> to return <em>a proof that the lengths aren't equal</em> (in the form of evidence that their difference is not 0) in the failure case. This is pretty similar to the standard Haskell technique of using <code>Either String a</code> to possibly return an error message, although a proof term is far more computationally useful than a string!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Thus ends this whistle-stop tour of some of the techniques that are common in dependently-typed Haskell programming. Programming with types like this in Haskell is really cool, but really awkward at the same time. Breaking up all your dependent data into lots of representations which mean the same thing - <code>Nat</code> the type, <code>Nat</code> the kind, <code>Natty n</code> the singleton - is really quite cumbersome, despite the existence of code-generators to help with the boilerplate. There are also presently limitations on what can be promoted to the type level. It's tantalising though! The mind boggles at the possibilities - in the literature there are examples in Haskell of strongly typed <code>printf</code>, database interfaces, UI layout engines...</p>\n\n<p>If you want some further reading, there's a growing body of literature about dependently typed Haskell, both published and on sites like Stack Overflow. A good starting point is <a href=\"https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/pub/hasochism.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the <em>Hasochism</em> paper</a> - the paper goes through this very example (among others), discussing the painful parts in some detail. <a href=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eir/papers/2012/singletons/paper.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The <em>Singletons</em> paper</a> demonstrates the technique of singleton values (such as <code>Natty</code>).

Note that the types <code>S</code> and <code>Z</code> don't have any member values - only types of kind <code>*</code> are inhabited by values.</p>\n\n<p>Now we introduce a <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/GADT\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GADT</a> representing vectors with a known length.

A vector is either <code>VNil</code>, in which case it has a length of <code>Z</code>(ero), or it's a <code>VCons</code> cell adding an item to another vector, in which case its length is one more than the other vector (<code>S n</code>). Note that there's no constructor argument of type <code>n</code>. It's just used at compile time to track lengths, and will be erased before the compiler generates machine code.</p>\n\n<p>We've defined a vector type which carries around static knowledge of its length. Let's query the type of a few <code>Vec</code>s to get a feel for how they work:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; :t (VCons 'a' (VCons 'b' VNil))\n(VCons 'a' (VCons 'b' VNil)) :: Vec ('S ('S 'Z)) Char  -- (S (S Z)) means 2\nghci&gt; :t (VCons 13 (VCons 11 (VCons 3 VNil)))\n(VCons 13 (VCons 11 (VCons 3 VNil))) :: Num a =&gt; Vec ('S ('S ('S 'Z))) a  -- (S (S (S Z))) means 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The dot product proceeds just as it would for a list:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-- note that the two Vec arguments are declared to have the same length\nvap :: Vec n (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Vec n a -&gt; Vec n b\nvap VNil VNil = VNil\nvap (VCons f fs) (VCons x xs) = VCons (f x) (vap fs xs)\n\nzipWith :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; Vec n a -&gt; Vec n b -&gt; Vec n c\nzipWith f xs ys = fmap f xs `vap` ys\n\ndot :: Num a =&gt; Vec n a -&gt; Vec n a -&gt; a\ndot xs ys = foldr (+) 0 $ zipWith (*) xs ys\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>vap</code>, which 'zippily' applies a vector of functions to a vector of arguments, is <code>Vec</code>'s applicative <code>&lt;*&gt;</code>; I didn't put it in an <code>Applicative</code> instance because <a href=\"https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/pub/hasochism.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">it gets messy</a>. Note also that I'm using the <code>foldr</code> from the compiler-generated instance of <code>Foldable</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Let's try it out:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; let v1 = VCons 2 (VCons 1 VNil)\nghci&gt; let v2 = VCons 4 (VCons 5 VNil)\nghci&gt; v1 `dot` v2\n13\nghci&gt; let v3 = VCons 8 (VCons 6 (VCons 1 VNil))\nghci&gt; v1 `dot` v3\n&lt;interactive&gt;:20:10:\n    Couldn't match type \u2018'S 'Z\u2019 with \u2018'Z\u2019\n    Expected type: Vec ('S ('S 'Z)) a\n      Actual type: Vec ('S ('S ('S 'Z))) a\n    In the second argument of \u2018dot\u2019, namely \u2018v3\u2019\n    In the expression: v1 `dot` v3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Great! You get a compile-time error when you try to <code>dot</code> vectors whose lengths don't match.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Here's an attempt at a function to concatenate vectors together:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-- This won't compile because the type checker can't deduce the length of the returned vector\n-- VNil +++ ys = ys\n-- (VCons x xs) +++ ys = VCons x (concat xs ys)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The length of the output vector would be the <em>sum</em> of the lengths of the two input vectors. We need to teach the type checker how to add <code>Nat</code>s together. For this we use a <a href=\"https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Type_families\" rel=\"noreferrer\">type-level function</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>type family (n :: Nat) :+: (m :: Nat) :: Nat where\n    Z :+: m = m\n    (S n) :+: m = S (n :+: m)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This <code>type family</code> declaration introduces a <em>function on types</em> called <code>:+:</code> - in other words, it's a recipe for the type checker to calculate the sum of two natural numbers. It's defined recursively - whenever the left operand is greater than <code>Z</code>ero we add one to the output and reduce it by one in the recursive call. (It's a good exercise to write a type function which multiplies two <code>Nat</code>s.) Now we can make <code>+++</code> compile:</p>\n\n<pre><code>infixr 5 +++\n(+++) :: Vec n a -&gt; Vec m a -&gt; Vec (n :+: m) a\nVNil +++ ys = ys\n(VCons x xs) +++ ys = VCons x (concat xs ys)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's how you use it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; VCons 1 (VCons 2 VNil) +++ VCons 3 (VCons 4 VNil)\nVCons 1 (VCons 2 (VCons 3 (VCons 4 VNil)))\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So far so simple. What about when we want to do the opposite of concatenation and split a vector in two? The lengths of the output vectors depend on the runtime value of the arguments. We'd like to write something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-- this won't work because there aren't any values of type `S` and `Z`\n-- split :: (n :: Nat) -&gt; Vec (n :+: m) a -&gt; (Vec n a, Vec m a)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but unfortunately Haskell won't let us do that. Allowing the <em>value</em> of the <code>n</code> argument to appear in the <em>return type</em> (this is commonly called a <em>dependent function</em> or <em>pi type</em>) would require \"full-spectrum\" dependent types, whereas <code>DataKinds</code> only gives us promoted type constructors. To put it another way, the type constructors <code>S</code> and <code>Z</code> don't appear at the value level.

There are also a few functions to help you work with this type: we'll be using <a href=\"https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.2/docs/Data-Type-Equality.html#g:2\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>gcastWith</code></a> to convert between equivalent types, and <a href=\"https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.2/docs/Data-Type-Equality.html#g:3\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>TestEquality</code></a> to determine whether two <code>Natty</code>s are equal.</p>\n\n<p>To test the equality of two <code>Natty</code>s, we're going to need to make use of the fact that if two numbers are equal, then their successors are also equal (<code>:~:</code> is <em>congruent</em> over <code>S</code>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>congSuc :: (n :~: m) -&gt; (S n :~: S m)\ncongSuc Refl = Refl\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Pattern matching on <code>Refl</code> on the left-hand side lets GHC know that <code>n ~ m</code>. With that knowledge, it's trivial that <code>S n ~ S m</code>, so GHC lets us return a new <code>Refl</code> right away.</p>\n\n<p>Now we can write an instance of <code>TestEquality</code> by straightforward recursion. If both numbers are zero, they are equal. If both numbers have predecessors, they are equal iff the predecessors are equal. (If they're not equal, just return <code>Nothing</code>.)</p>\n\n<pre><code>instance TestEquality Natty where\n    -- testEquality :: Natty n -&gt; Natty m -&gt; Maybe (n :~: m)\n    testEquality Zy Zy = Just Refl\n    testEquality (Sy n) (Sy m) = fmap congSuc (testEquality n m)  -- check whether the predecessors are equal, then make use of congruence\n    testEquality Zy _ = Nothing\n    testEquality _ Zy = Nothing\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we can put the pieces together to <code>dot</code> a pair of <code>AVec</code>s of unknown length.</p>\n\n<pre><code>dot' :: Num a =&gt; AVec a -&gt; AVec a -&gt; Maybe a\ndot' (AVec n u) (AVec m v) = fmap (\\proof -&gt; gcastWith proof (dot u v)) (testEquality n m)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>First, pattern match on the <code>AVec</code> constructor to pull out a runtime representation of the vectors' lengths. Now use <code>testEquality</code> to determine whether those lengths are equal. If they are, we'll have <code>Just Refl</code>; <code>gcastWith</code> will use that equality proof to ensure that <code>dot u v</code> is well-typed by discharging its implicit <code>n ~ m</code> assumption.</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; let v1 = fromList [1,2,3]\nghci&gt; let v2 = fromList [4,5,6]\nghci&gt; let v3 = fromList [7,8]\nghci&gt; dot' v1 v2\nJust 32\nghci&gt; dot' v1 v3\nNothing  -- they weren't the same length\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that, since a vector without static knowledge of its length is basically a list, we've effectively re-implemented the list version of <code>dot :: Num a =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; Maybe a</code>. The difference is that this version is implemented in terms of the vectors' <code>dot</code>. Here's the point: before the type checker will allow you to call <code>dot</code>, <strong>you must have tested</strong> whether the input lists have the same length using <code>testEquality</code>. I am prone to getting <code>if</code>-statements the wrong way round, but not in a dependently-typed setting!</p>\n\n<p>You can't avoid using existential wrappers at the edges of your system, when you're dealing with runtime data, but you can use dependent types everywhere inside your system and keep the existential wrappers at the edges, when you perform input validation.</p>\n\n<p>Since <code>Nothing</code>is not very informative, you could further refine the type of <code>dot'</code> to return <em>a proof that the lengths aren't equal</em> (in the form of evidence that their difference is not 0) in the failure case. This is pretty similar to the standard Haskell technique of using <code>Either String a</code> to possibly return an error message, although a proof term is far more computationally useful than a string!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Thus ends this whistle-stop tour of some of the techniques that are common in dependently-typed Haskell programming. Programming with types like this in Haskell is really cool, but really awkward at the same time. Breaking up all your dependent data into lots of representations which mean the same thing - <code>Nat</code> the type, <code>Nat</code> the kind, <code>Natty n</code> the singleton - is really quite cumbersome, despite the existence of code-generators to help with the boilerplate. There are also presently limitations on what can be promoted to the type level. It's tantalising though! The mind boggles at the possibilities - in the literature there are examples in Haskell of strongly typed <code>printf</code>, database interfaces, UI layout engines...</p>\n\n<p>If you want some further reading, there's a growing body of literature about dependently typed Haskell, both published and on sites like Stack Overflow. A good starting point is <a href=\"https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/pub/hasochism.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the <em>Hasochism</em> paper</a> - the paper goes through this very example (among others), discussing the painful parts in some detail. <a href=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eir/papers/2012/singletons/paper.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The <em>Singletons</em> paper</a> demonstrates the technique of singleton values (such as <code>Natty</code>).

Lets use the JButton example:</p>\n\n<p>1) SRP: The method isDoubleBuffered goes beyond the responsibility of JButton to represent a UI button. That method represents an implementation detail that has nothing to do with abstract concept of a UI button.</p>\n\n<p>2) OCP: If I want to change how JButton handles events I have to replace the JButton class completely.</p>\n\n<p>3) LSP: The implementation of JButton cannot be readily substituted with other implementations. JButton inherits most of it's implementation details directly. If I want to change the way a JButton creates tooltips, assigns action listeners, or access the graphics context, I have to throw away all of SWING. I cannot simply drop in a new class that handles those things since JButton inherits directly from JComponent.</p>\n\n<p>4) ISP: The JButton public interface is littered with dozons of methods from every class that it inherits from. It is litterally a dumping group of public methods from JComponent, Container, Compound, etc. If the interface of JButton adhered to ISP there would only be 10 or so publically exposed methods.</p>\n\n<p>5) DIP: JButton publicly exposes methods of it's concrete implementation details. If it applied true dependancy inversion then things like icon's, layout, event handling, etc would be delegated to separate classes that the user could readily switch out to achieve new functionality.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>In general, I disagree that GUI frameworks violate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)\" rel=\"nofollow\">SOLID</a>. There may be exceptions, but this wraps up my experience with multiple frameworks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>SRP: a GUI class typically has one responsibility. Maybe it is responding to an event, rendering an object, or maybe it is \"represent this UI element.\" That last one might sound like it is not a \"single\" responsibility because that one responsibility is to tie everything together (e.g. <code>JButton</code> or <code>JPanel</code>). The key to look for is those \"big\" object often delegate to other objects that are specialized and handle one aspect of the object in detail (event handling, rendering, etc).</p></li>\n<li><p>Open/Closed: Your example shows how UI classes are definitely open for extension: there is a lot of inheritance going on. One could argue that UI classes violate the \"closed for modification\" aspect since they are typically very configurable and can be modified to do a lot of things differently, but that is one purpose of these classes to begin with.</p></li>\n<li><p>Liskov Substitution: in pretty much every framework I have seen, subclasses add more functionality and still allow parent class behavior. It does not always make sense, but it is supported. For example, you could nest UI elements inside of a button if it extends a frame (perhaps one could add an icon to a button this way, a picture element nested inside a button despite \"button\" not being commonly thought of as a parent element). This principle is key to the nested nature of UI frameworks.</p></li>\n<li><p>Interface segregation: my main experience here is with Java, where there are many little interfaces for various listeners and handlers. Seems like a good fit.</p></li>\n<li><p>Dependency inversion: along with the Liskov argument, many frameworks do rely on abstractions. For example, there may be some high level interface or abstract class to represent all UI components.

The <code>View</code> class is responsible for </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>positioning</li>\n<li>drawing</li>\n<li>event processing</li>\n<li>handling a huge load of other callbacks.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, if you consider the SRP as \"A class should only have one reason to change\" - you already lost the argument. They tried it by creating <code>ViewGroup</code> and making the <code>ListView</code> use an <code>Adapter</code> for the actual data. These things actually work quite well.</p>\n\n<p><em>Open closed principle</em>. Although basically open for extension, unfortunately only via inheritance. There's no way no modify behavior (e.g something in the drawing or layouting process) via strategy-pattern or something similar. Everything is a constant, so you have to choose between the existing options.</p>\n\n<p><em>Liskov substitution principle</em> is of course met via the java language requirements. I do remember though, that we had issues with <code>TextView</code> or <code>EditText</code> in the past, were the inherited method returned the same type and was named the same; <em>behaved</em> differently anyway. The post-condition wasn't met. Too bad I don't remember exactly what it was. Something with the Focus or same properties having different result or something.</p>\n\n<p><em>Interface segregation</em>. What should I say? The basic <code>View</code> interface is polluted with methods over methods. Why is the scrolling implemented (and accessed) via the <code>View</code> class? Remember the callbacks I mentioned before? But in general, if you're trying to \"implement\" the View \"interface\" (extending the class) you only need override the methods you really need - but this is more like a language feature in java. If you see it more pedantically, you'll actually implement scrolling by overriding the class even if you don't need it.</p>\n\n<p><em>Dependency inversion</em> seems to be ok in android. But I'm sure that if you really search for it, you'll find enough spots in the framework were something depends on an implementation instead of an abstraction. I'm not sure whether the 34 <code>instanceof</code> calls in the <code>View</code> class are a sign of good abstractions.</p>\n\n<p>In general, the android sdk tries its best fulfilling all principles. I also know that it's fairly large and also needs to take performance into account, so it's harder to make it fulfill all principles.</p>\n\n<p>I should add, that I probably wouldnt be able to do any better.</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Two years ago, my boss handed me my first annual salary adjustment letter. It was a substantial increase, retroactive to the beginning of the year.</p>\n\n<p>I filed it away. I noticed a pay bump, but because I also adjusted my 401k and insurance around that time, it wasn't obvious that I wasn't getting the full amount described on the adjustment letter.</p>\n\n<p>Doing my taxes the next year, I noticed my gross income didn't seem to match what I remembered that letter saying. I looked at my paychecks online and found that I was actually being paid <em>$5k less</em> than that amount. Unfortunately, I'd misplaced that letter, and started to suspect that I had just misread it. And it was still a decent increase, after all.</p>\n\n<p>My next annual salary adjustment hailed a \"raise\" of $2k (i.e., less than I originally thought I was making the year before). But again, I couldn't say for sure without last year's letter, and I was embarrassed to think I'd misread that sort of pay increase.</p>\n\n<p>After filing this year's salary adjustment letter, however, I found my original letter from 2017. It really does have that higher salary figure in black and white, and confirmed that number by saying it was \"an increase of $XX,XXX.\" I hadn't misread it after all.</p>\n\n<p>I brought all three salary adjustment letters to HR today and asked what happened. It turns out my manager asked for special permission to give me the larger-than-usual raise. In an email to HR, the CEO approved the smaller raise I actually got, but somehow that change never made it to the letter my manager ultimately signed and handed to me a couple weeks later.</p>\n\n<p>On the surface, it looks like an honest mistake on HR's part. And I should have been more diligent in following up when I noticed the problem, especially now that it's two years (and two salary adjustment letters) past.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Should I mention anything to my manager?</strong> Or just let it go?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Several times in my career, I've encountered situations where the business has a technical problem, and I have the previous experience and skills necessary to resolve the issue.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of being trusted to solve the issue, these companies have typically hired (expensive) external consultants to come in and \"save us\". Their theory being \"they're paid to work in that area, so they must be experts\"...</p>\n\n<p>In each case, I've already presented my understanding of the problem and my proposed solution. Each and every time, the consultants produce a report that supports my conclusions (but often goes into less detail - as I've had the advantage of examining the original issue over more time).</p>\n\n<p>Then, what usually happens is that I've gained some \"business credibility\" in subject \"A\", but if a problem ever occurs with topic \"B\" it'll be the same uphill battle all over again.</p>\n\n<p>I've also seen attitudes resembling:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"We don't know, so you can't know.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If they've had an issue for months or years, then you join and suggest something they haven't tried, there's almost a willful refusal to consider the possibility.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The consultants are employed by the vendor/OEM, so they must know.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even when it's a relatively trivial issue, they'll assume they need an oracle on the subject (thinking along the lines of \"we have a Java issue, James Gosling must be the only person able to help us\").</p>\n\n<p>Now, I'd hope that I have a reasonably realistic assessment of my own abilities (or lack thereof), so when there's a problem outside of my \"domain\" I'll just do everything possible to stay out of the way and absorb the knowledge demonstrated by whoever gets tasked with resolving it (basically, I don't pretend to know what I don't know about). </p>\n\n<p><strong>How can I convince my employer that I have the level of competence they require when it's in an area where they lack the expertise to assess competence?</strong> </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>A few people commenting and answering have missed a nuance to my question. The people I'm working with are not incompetent in general (quite the opposite in fact), they simply lack competence <strong>for a given skill</strong> - usually on a rare topic.</p>\n\n<p>This means I do not patronize, talk down to them or speak to them with any disdain or disrespect (as some answerers have assumed). In fact, when the topic is in an area they have a degree of familiarity with, I find it very easy to get \"buy-in\" and support for my ideas. The only time I encounter any issues is when they lack the tools to assess my competence in a skill they lack themselves.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>The best way to prevent the race for a consultant is present a convincing business case that doesn't include a consultant.  From the business cases I've developed the main points are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Thoroughly define the problem being solved - Do not include your solution within the problem definition.  Concisely state the problem in business terms rather than technical terms.  For example \"Based on submitted bug reports customers find feature X confusing.  This confusion leads to frustration and reduces engagement in the overall product.\" is much better than \"The UI of feature X is flawed in these ways...\" because it states the problem in terms of business value.  In terms of solution ownership this shows that you understand the issue from a business perspective which is key since this is the same perspective that the decision makers will be looking from.  This will get everyone on the same page as to what the problem is from a high level.</li>\n<li>State your solution along with several other possible plans of\naction including the null case of doing nothing and state the\ncosts/benefits for each. For the above example I would go through\ndoing nothing, scrapping feature X, improving user training/help\ndocuments, reworking the UI on feature X.  This shows that you have\nlooked at the issue from several sides rather than immediately\nhopping onto your pet solution to the exclusion of all others.</li>\n<li>Show how you can effectively test if your solution eliminates the\nproblem.  This is huge in selling non-technical people on technical\nsolutions.  They want assurance that their investment is working so\nif you can give them concrete parameters and a way to measure\nsuccess.  If the definition of success is murky it is\npsychologically much harder to buy in to an idea.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My best real world example regarding going to a consultant is imagine you go to a mechanic for routine inspection.  If you hear \"Your garbles are cracked.  It's $800 to change them out.  Should I go ahead with that?\"  you are not going to be very confident in your ability to know if your money is being well spent and you may get a second opinion.  If you hear \"Your garbles are slightly cracked which could lead to your steering failing if you hit a pothole.  We could wait and see but that's risky.  I could weld across the crack for $500 but I wouldn't trust it long run.  It would be $800 to swap them out.  Swapping them out is the only way we can be sure they will hold.  What do you want me to do?\" you are going to feel more empowered to make a good decision even if the ultimate decision is the same.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note in a lot of places you are going to be fighting the culture to make headway on this.  Don't take it personally if the default answer is consultancy, just continue to work on your sales skills for selling your ideas to management.  When a decision goes against you on this remember that you may be missing pieces of the bigger picture (ie cost of failure may be higher than it generally appears due to interdependencies) or the opportunity cost for you doing this project rather than something else might be too high.</p>\n",
            " <p>I've seen the same type of issue in my own past.  As noted by Myles part of the issue might be a communication problem. Often, people will not necessarily understand a technical person's description of a problem or the appropriate solution. Graphs, pictures and external supporting references sometimes confer some comfort to the reader.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of your communication skills I suggest there is a very difficult to overcome reason for such behavior as a company grows. Higher level people who are making decisions often abhor making a decision that they can be held directly accountable for. If they take a risk on a solution you propose and it doesn't work out they either stumble themselves or a strong internal resource stumbles.</p>\n\n<p>Neither is acceptable to some people.</p>\n\n<p>When a brand name consultant comes along, which of course appears to represent expertise, which at times is simply not any more advanced than internal resources, there is a nice convenient place to put the blame. I went with what the consultants proposed and so did the rest of the stakeholders involved. It came in a flashy document with loads of details which must mean it was correct.</p>\n\n<p>So, yes, if there's a problem we fire the consultant. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not a fan of this but I have seen the reins handed over to bumbling consulting and development groups too many times to discount this effect. Now, there are other good reasons, such as not having the time and resources to tackle the issue internally -- or quite simply not having a large enough team with solid skills in the area being considered even though one or two folks may.</p>\n\n<p>My viewpoint may be peppered with a touch of jaded... ;)</p>\n",
            " <p>I wonder why you oppose bringing in consultants if the end results is that something gets implemented that is just what you would have suggested, especially when afterwards everyone agrees that you totally did know what the right course of action was. Is it that you would have liked to get recognition in advance that your idea was right? Is it that you think the company is wasting money paying consultants for advice they could have had for free?</p>\n\n<p>Those external consultants (and yes, quite often I am one of them) bring a lot more into the group than the idea of what to do to get your problem solved. They bring external authority and expertise, which often sways other participants into changing their ways, far more so than a logical explanation of why a particular course of action is right. They bring a convenient scapegoat also - if someone changes how they do things because a colleague or peer said to, and it goes bad, the blame will be on the changer, but if someone changes how they do things because a highly paid external consultant said to, and it goes bad, the blame will be on the consultant. They also demonstrate, by the sheer money that is being spent on them, that management is truly committed to making this change.</p>\n\n<p>I can't tell you how many times someone has told me \"that recommendation you made today, that they've all agreed to and are starting to do? I argued for that a month ago and nobody would listen.\" I reassure them that this is a widespread phenomenon that <strong>does not</strong> (and here's where I start to actually answer your question) <strong>reflect management's actual opinion of their skill level.</strong> Let me say that again. The reason people don't take your advice, and then later take that very same advice from a paid external consultant, is <strong>not</strong> because they think you are less skilled than you are or your advice is less valuable than it is. </p>\n\n<p>Go ahead and put a little effort into showing you can solve it yourself. If they don't listen (and they probably won't) make sure you get a chance to work closely with the consultants. You can tell them what you know, which will improve the quality of the solution, you may (or may not) learn from them, and when the project succeeds you will be associated with the success. Don't get worked up about the possibility that silly old management is incapable of understanding how good you are or how simple their technical problems are. You may be right, but often there is more to a technical problem than a technical solution.</p>\n",
            " <p>My problem with the question is that it assumes the person who made the choice to hire a consultant is incompetent.  I do not think the Dunning-Kruger failure effect is the real or only reason why you are not successful in your attempts to convince people not to use consultants when you have the available skills. And really what do you gain by assuming that other people are falling into the Dunning-Kruger effect? Does this help you be effective at work in any way?  Why are you even thinking about it? It actually prevents you from seeing what you can do to improve the situation if you are stuck on the idea that other people are incompetent.</p>\n\n<p>First, if your attitude is that they just don't get me and recognize how wonderful I am, then people will pick up that you resent them and be less likely to consult you. So stop even thinking about Dunning-Kruger because it is irrelevant to getting the job done. Your post came across as pretty negative about your managers' incompetence. If I thought that, then there is a good chance that they do too. </p>\n\n<p>Next, there are so many reasons to hire consultants over your own employees to solve problems that have nothing to do with what they think of you. </p>\n\n<p>First you may be highly thought of and they don't think they can spare the time from your regular duties for you to do this.</p>\n\n<p>Second, you may not be presenting your ideas in a way that they understand. Technical people tend to focus on the technical, managers tend to focus on the business need. You have to be talking their language.</p>\n\n<p>Third they may have money in the budget they need to spend or they won't get it next year.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, they may agree with your solution but know it is an easier sell to senior management if it comes from an outside source. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to contribute to change at your organization, you need to first start helping the consultants. It will be noticed that you have contributed if you do this.  Pay attention to how they present the results versus how you did it. Learn how to present ideas like a successful consultant.  </p>\n\n<p>Next don't assume that the people making the decisions are even aware of your skills. Likely anyone beyond your immediate boss doesn't know you already have the skills they are looking for. I've even had bosses who did not know my background if they were not the person who originally hired me and the task was outside the normal duties I did for them. (But if I wanted them to use those skills, I made sure to make sure they knew.) You need to become visible to the higher levels of the organization, see this question for more on this subject:\n<a href=\"https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/11816/why-is-it-important-to-gain-visibility-in-the-workplace\">Why is it important to gain &quot;visibility&quot; in the workplace?</a> </p>\n\n<p>You should welcome the consultants because every time they make the same recommendation you did, then your credibility is increased.</p>\n",
            " <p>Serious problems rarely have one solution nor are they always solved to a specific degree. There is some gray area. Like all engineers, you want to solve problems (which is good), but managers also have to factor in risk.</p>\n\n<p>Consultants can mitigate risk:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>They were highly recommended (i.e. it's not my fault if they screw up)</li>\n<li>They can be contractually held to providing solutions or payment can be withheld where as employees just get fired.</li>\n<li>Consultants can have access to other types of expertise if something unexpected comes up.</li>\n<li>Current Staff may have expertise, but not the time to implement a solution.</li>\n<li>Some managers have previous experience with a particular consultant, so they feel more comfortable with that person. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(Per update to the question) It is safe to assume that people who lack knowledge in an area struggle to identify those who can. It seems like you're able to put together a detailed proposal, but management may be more comfortable if you just get to the point.</p>\n",
            " <p>The empirical evidence says that when you know a good solution you are unable to build group consensus that it is the best way forward. Unless you consistently work for, and with, incompetent people, then the balance of probabilities is that the problem is in your soft skills, specifically with consensus building. This may be a case of Dunning-Kruger but where you are over-estimating your skills in the area of teamwork, consensus building, and stakeholder management. </p>\n\n<p>You state that \"instead of being trusted to solve the issue\" they hire in a consultant. No-one is infallible so taking something on trust is taking a risk. If there is significant potential downside it would be irrational not to minimise risk. It is trivial to eliminate the risk of taking what you say on trust; get a consultant in for a second opinion. A lack of \"soft skills\" and an over focus on the technical aspects of problem solving may be driving them into hiring consultants. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=EQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">high EQ</a> approach is:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Don't bring <em>your</em> solution to the group; bring the group to <em>their</em> solution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Parachuting a solution into a group of stakeholders always risks rejection. People will not have thought through all the avenues you have thought through. They cannot feel comfortable that all the possible alternatives are inferior. The high EQ approach is to talk the solution space over with some key stakeholders one-to-one in advance of any group meetings. This refines your argument and builds support for your recommendations. Go over some possible approaches you have rejected asking whether your rejection reasoning is sound. Then present your favoured solution asking if you have missed any angles, risks or issues. Finally ask them if they can think of any good alternative approaches. Repeat this with a few stakeholders one-to-one until you are sure you have all the angles covered and have perfected your pitch. </p>\n\n<p>Only then hold a group meeting with all stakeholders and take the same approach; go through the alternatives which have been rejected and why. Then pitch your favoured solution and perhaps an alternative someone else has come up with to show you are being open minded and balanced. </p>\n\n<p>Taking such a consensus building approach works for many reasons: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>People feel you have listened and have a fully rounded perspective on all risk and issues.  </li>\n<li>People understand the alternative ideas you have considered and why\nthey are rejected.</li>\n<li>You learn new things about risks and issues of alternative solutions.</li>\n<li>You learn which risks and issues stakeholders are more or less concerned about.   </li>\n<li>Some people you have consulted feel vested in your preferred solution because you have taken time to go over it with them.  </li>\n<li>Some people get more time to consider your solution on two encounters; once when you go over it with them directly and a second time when you bring it to the wider group. If your solution is superior to the alternatives they are likely to be convinced that it is the best way forward. </li>\n<li>You can present the solution as being a group solution by saying things like \"Mary pointed out that X could go wrong which we can cover by doing Y\". </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=EQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Googling \"EQ\"</a> brings up: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For most people, emotional intelligence (EQ) is more important than\n  one's intelligence (IQ) in attaining success in their lives and\n  careers. As individuals our success and the success of the profession\n  today depend on our ability to read other people's signals and react\n  appropriately to them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You should read that people are not persuaded by your approach and are unwilling to simply trust you. The appropriate reaction is to engage with people, learn their concerns, help them to refine the solution, and pitch the solution as owned by the team, not by you. </p>\n",
            " <p>I think you might be missing another aspect of the cost-benefit equation here.</p>\n\n<p>There are quite a few reasons to hire consultants, and one of those is to simply allow for the internal staff to be able to focus on the day to day running of the environment.<br>\nI've come into quite a few shops where the staff knew what the problem was, and had a pretty good idea of the cause or even a solution already planned.</p>\n\n<p>Going into these environments, my main impression is usually that I'm being asked for a plan not because they don't have one, but because <em>they want to compare it with the plan already provided by their internal staff to gauge my competence</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The internal staff is usually required for day to day workings, and are the first stop whenever a problem occurs. While the issue I'm brought in to fix is something that, while often time consuming, is not a recurring action. And as such can easily be handled by an external asset who can be safely let go once the job is done.</p>\n\n<p>Have you actually asked your boss(es) why they prefer hiring consultants for these issues in stead of going with your recommendations?<br>\nIf they are competent managers, the answer might surprise you, and have less to do with their perceived competence of your skills than you think.</p>\n",
            " <p>Catalogue all the times this has happened, get estimates for how much was spent on consultants to come up with solutions (as opposed to implementing them), then go as high as you can in the organisation and ask for a pay raise.</p>\n\n<p>The obvious rule of thumb being used here is \"more expense = more excellence\". If they're paying you more, they'll take you more seriously.</p>\n"

        "sft_target": " <p>The best way to prevent the race for a consultant is present a convincing business case that doesn't include a consultant.  From the business cases I've developed the main points are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Thoroughly define the problem being solved - Do not include your solution within the problem definition.  Concisely state the problem in business terms rather than technical terms.  For example \"Based on submitted bug reports customers find feature X confusing.  This confusion leads to frustration and reduces engagement in the overall product.\" is much better than \"The UI of feature X is flawed in these ways...\" because it states the problem in terms of business value.  In terms of solution ownership this shows that you understand the issue from a business perspective which is key since this is the same perspective that the decision makers will be looking from.  This will get everyone on the same page as to what the problem is from a high level.</li>\n<li>State your solution along with several other possible plans of\naction including the null case of doing nothing and state the\ncosts/benefits for each. For the above example I would go through\ndoing nothing, scrapping feature X, improving user training/help\ndocuments, reworking the UI on feature X.  This shows that you have\nlooked at the issue from several sides rather than immediately\nhopping onto your pet solution to the exclusion of all others.</li>\n<li>Show how you can effectively test if your solution eliminates the\nproblem.  This is huge in selling non-technical people on technical\nsolutions.  They want assurance that their investment is working so\nif you can give them concrete parameters and a way to measure\nsuccess.  If the definition of success is murky it is\npsychologically much harder to buy in to an idea.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My best real world example regarding going to a consultant is imagine you go to a mechanic for routine inspection.  If you hear \"Your garbles are cracked.  It's $800 to change them out.  Should I go ahead with that?\"  you are not going to be very confident in your ability to know if your money is being well spent and you may get a second opinion.  If you hear \"Your garbles are slightly cracked which could lead to your steering failing if you hit a pothole.  We could wait and see but that's risky.  I could weld across the crack for $500 but I wouldn't trust it long run.  It would be $800 to swap them out.  Swapping them out is the only way we can be sure they will hold.  What do you want me to do?\" you are going to feel more empowered to make a good decision even if the ultimate decision is the same.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note in a lot of places you are going to be fighting the culture to make headway on this.  Don't take it personally if the default answer is consultancy, just continue to work on your sales skills for selling your ideas to management.  When a decision goes against you on this remember that you may be missing pieces of the bigger picture (ie cost of failure may be higher than it generally appears due to interdependencies) or the opportunity cost for you doing this project rather than something else might be too high.</p>\n",
        "rejected_target": " <p>I've seen the same type of issue in my own past.  As noted by Myles part of the issue might be a communication problem. Often, people will not necessarily understand a technical person's description of a problem or the appropriate solution. Graphs, pictures and external supporting references sometimes confer some comfort to the reader.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of your communication skills I suggest there is a very difficult to overcome reason for such behavior as a company grows. Higher level people who are making decisions often abhor making a decision that they can be held directly accountable for. If they take a risk on a solution you propose and it doesn't work out they either stumble themselves or a strong internal resource stumbles.</p>\n\n<p>Neither is acceptable to some people.</p>\n\n<p>When a brand name consultant comes along, which of course appears to represent expertise, which at times is simply not any more advanced than internal resources, there is a nice convenient place to put the blame. I went with what the consultants proposed and so did the rest of the stakeholders involved. It came in a flashy document with loads of details which must mean it was correct.</p>\n\n<p>So, yes, if there's a problem we fire the consultant. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not a fan of this but I have seen the reins handed over to bumbling consulting and development groups too many times to discount this effect. Now, there are other good reasons, such as not having the time and resources to tackle the issue internally -- or quite simply not having a large enough team with solid skills in the area being considered even though one or two folks may.</p>\n\n<p>My viewpoint may be peppered with a touch of jaded... ;)</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I'm currently entering my senior year of college and am beginning to apply for full time positions after graduation.</p>\n\n<p>For the past 1.5 years I've worked part time during the school year and full time during the summers for a mid-large size firm. One of the supervisors who I worked closely with wrote my a one page letter of reference at my request. This supervisor used to be a high up department head for a major government regulatory agency (he has a Wikipedia page and is extremely well known by those within the industry). The reference letter he wrote me is extremely positive and highlights much of the specific work we have done together over the past 1.5 years. It's about a page long.</p>\n\n<p>I obviously want to highlight that relationship and present future employers with the letter as I feel that it would certainly help me in my application. The issue that i'm having is that the majority of applications don't ask for a reference letter. Should I send this reference letter to employers even if it has not been asked for? </p>\n\n<p>For example I am actually applying to work in the government agency he used to head. Obviously I feel that his recommendation would carry a lot of weight but the application for that position doesn't ask for a reference letter and doesn't seem to expect it. How can I include the letter in these types of applications or should I simply leave it out unless asked? </p>\n\n<p>I've already highlighted that we had a close working relationship in my resume and talked about some of the work we did together but would like to showcase his perspective if possible.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
