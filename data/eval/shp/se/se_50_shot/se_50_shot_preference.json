    "\n\nHuman: <p>I am about to finish an undergraduate degree, with a good enough GPA that even if I got C's in all of my current classes, my final overall cumulative GPA would remain above 3.6.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming I graduate with all the whistles in my diploma it would be:</p>\n\n<p>Honours Bachelors of science in computer science with distinction and a minor in pure mathematics (quite pompous).</p>\n\n<p>In order to complete all of those whistles I had to do supervised research for two semesters. Being a naive undergraduate, I knocked on proffessor's doors, asking for a supervisor, and one of them, very generously agreed. He suggested a problem I thought was interesting and so I started the research. I originally started throwing analysis at the problem, and started trying to solve some really complex differential equations (which kept me motivated). However I did not make much progress, so after my supervisor marked that I needed to get something, I fully changed my approach and started using some geometric approximations to solve the issue. This generated some results, but was too simple. I'd like to say that my results were inversely proportional to how much effort I was putting in the research.</p>\n\n<p>Time passed, I had multiple potential solutions and a way to evaluate them. On the last week before the final submission I realised there was a bug in my code base that was destroying the results (they were mathematically impossible). I tried to find the error, but the best I could do was identify an area where a mistake could have happened. </p>\n\n<p>Finally I got my evaluation on the course after presenting it. The feedback said the methods were a bit naive and could be improved on, and it was dissapointing that I didn't get numerical results (I had visual results, not numerical), however since I was not a seasoned researcher they decided to be lenient and gave me an A anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I applied to the grad program at my university, and asked the same proffessor to be my supervisor for the grad program. I am in desperate need of financial support until the grad program starts, and so my supervisor said I could do summer research for him and in the meanwhile we could discuss what the grad project could be. What he wants me to do is finish my previous work and get a publication. </p>\n\n<p>The issue is that I legitimately feel that dinking bleach would be more motivating (I am using this metaphor to convey just how much anxiety this is giving me). This research really does not appeal to me in any way or form, and the interesting part is over, all that is missing is finding the bug, which could take more than two weeks to solve and implementing a couple of modifications to make my naive methods less naive if things go well, or complete failure to finish it in the worst case.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to that I have been doing independent research simultaneously as I have been taking courses and doing everything else. Although this independent research still needs a lot of work, it's in a good place, I have already improved many of the papers I have read and have multiple ideas to explore. In an ideal world I would win the lottery tomorrow and I could just support myself while I carry on with this research.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure how to approach my supervisor and tell him I don't want to finish this research, nor how to suggest to do my research instead and get a publication out of that, or even if I should touch on this topic at all.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I know this is a topic that some people have strong opinions about, but a toxic culture is developing in my department whereby several postdocs have convinced themselves that they are being mistreated because of extremely small -- often imaginary -- confrontations.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a postdoc encountered a senior staff member in a doorway. The staff member apparently gave her a \"funny look\", which confirmed the postdoc's view that this staff member is abusing their position of privilege. Anyone who points out that this is a total non sequitur is accused of allowing bullying to flourish. </p>\n\n<p>This situation has been building steadily over the last few years and now five or six postdocs keep a running tally of \"microaggressions\" so microscopic that it is very difficult to see how they can exist. For example, one postdoc sits with their back to a door, and a professor came in to talk to another colleague, and didn't acknowledge them. This incident was talked about for weeks as evidence of the professor's \"rudeness\". In other cases, some people are labelled \"creeps\".</p>\n\n<p>To be clear: I absolutely do not condone abuse. I know power dynamics are real, and that many minorities (of which I belong to several) experience daily microaggressions and othering. I have been on the receiving end of workplace bullying myself, and would never wish to silence real problems. I too am a postdoc, so have no additional power and gain nothing from allowing abuse to flourish.</p>\n\n<p>What worries me is that none of these incidents are being raised with any of the staff members in question. Therefore, many junior researchers have accepted as fact that their professors are horrible and selfish people. I'm concerned about this mindset, because in at least three cases, these \"selfish\" professors have some form of autism (I know this as I'm a wellness officer). Perfectly ordinary behaviour is framed as malicious.</p>\n\n<p>Personally I've found it very upsetting. Many of the people on the receiving end of this gossip are very kind, if not socially awkward, people. It scares me that so many people uncritically accept that everyone with a permanent job is some kind of bogeyman; of course, I cannot betray confidentiality by informing my colleagues that many of these incidents didn't occur and indeed it's kind of ableist to assume you can read minds all the time. Abuse and power struggles certainly can, and often do, occur... but if any of these complaints were substantial they should be raised with HR. </p>\n\n<p>The sad truth is that I think my colleagues just get their power from trash talking others, and aren't actually interested in the truth. Dissenting voices get shunned (and accused of being privileged / not being woke). Anyone who isn't in 100% agreement gets immediately shut down. But, also, my colleagues are just upsetting themselves for no reason. They're scared of encountering these \"terrifying\" professors, most of who have done nothing worse than dressing slightly shabbily and being uncomfortable with eye contact. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone have any advice on dealing with this kind of situation?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

For example, you could suggest a work-in-progress monthly session where PhD students and postdocs once a year or so talk about their work.

            " <p>For dealing with this kind of issue, I recommend looking at the rules for bullying and harassment <em>from both ends</em>.  It is settled law that rules on workplace bullying protect both junior employees from senior employees, but also protect senior employees from junior employees.  Moreover, to sustain a complaint of workplace bullying and harassment, this requires some ongoing or serious acts; it is not established by trivial isolated incidents of the kind you are describing (i.e., so-called \"microaggressions\").</p>\n\n<p>If your description is correct then a formal complaint of harassment for these \"micro-agressions\" would almost certainly not meet the requirements to be sustained.  In view of that, the people making the complaints must be careful that their own characterisations of senior staff, and their own rumour-mongering, does not <em>itself</em> amount to bullying and harassment.  In particular, referring to other staff members as \"creeps\", if done repeatedly and without any legitimate basis, could certainly amount to bullying.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of advice, that is where it gets tricky.  If someone is subject to name-calling and rumour-spreading they have the option to document this and put in their own complaint of bullying, even if they are a senior person and the bullying is coming from a junior colleague.  Ultimately you will need to think about what level of confrontation with this issue is desirable, and whether the staff in your department would be more amenable to an informal discussion to reduce tensions, or a formal complaint process where bad behaviour is dealt with through formal channels.</p>\n"

Their entire objection was based on an incorrect assumption -- if their assumption were true, I too would have suggested rejection. However, our results clearly showed this assumption is not true.

If not, should I simply move on? </p>\n\n<p>I should also mention, any future submission would explicitly state that this assumption is incorrect, but I would rather address point this directly with the referee, if it can be done so respectfully. </p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

I also agree with the OP's comment on the other answer: \"when I review a paper and raise questions or objections, I often lament that my questions are not resolved or explained when the paper is rejected. As a referee, I am constantly learning/thinking about new problems from new perspective: I think there is some (potential) value for a referee in having their questions address (and thus, helping their understanding of a new development they express genuine interested in).\"</p>\n\n<p>I do think, however, that the better approach is to actually think about why the reviewer might have gotten the wrong idea about the underlying assumption. What was it that didn't explain the issue clearly and allowed the reviewer to go in the wrong  direction with their review? Presumably, if a reviewer who is experienced in this field didn't get this important point, then others might as well. So the productive approach is to critically revisit your writing and , in any future manuscript on the topic, add sufficient discussion to ensure that this critical point is actually addressed and unambiguous. This way, you're not just correcting the opinion of that single reviewer, but of potentially any number of other readers who might have also wondered why you are writing a paper on an unfounded assumption.</p>\n"

As a referee, I am constantly learning/thinking about new problems from new perspective: I think there is some (potential) value for a referee in having their questions address (and thus, helping their understanding of a new development they express genuine interested in).\"</p>\n\n<p>I do think, however, that the better approach is to actually think about why the reviewer might have gotten the wrong idea about the underlying assumption. What was it that didn't explain the issue clearly and allowed the reviewer to go in the wrong  direction with their review? Presumably, if a reviewer who is experienced in this field didn't get this important point, then others might as well. So the productive approach is to critically revisit your writing and , in any future manuscript on the topic, add sufficient discussion to ensure that this critical point is actually addressed and unambiguous. This way, you're not just correcting the opinion of that single reviewer, but of potentially any number of other readers who might have also wondered why you are writing a paper on an unfounded assumption.</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I did a campus interview two weeks ago (US universities, R1, Engineering). I was not the last candidate, so, by considering the last one, the search was closed one week ago. In the last meeting with the department chair, he said the department will select the final candidate next week and it seems they have made some decisions based on the information I have. I received an update this weekend from the department chair indicating that they are working with the dean's office and I should get an update this week. First, I interpreted this email positively in a way that probably I will be their first choice since they should keep all finalists on hold until the first candidate (assuming to be me!) signs the offer, which normally takes time (negotiation, salary, lab space, ...). So, there is no reason to notify me if I am not the first candidate.</p>\n<p>Then, I looked at this matter differently and thought maybe they already have offered another candidate and they are indeed waiting to get some approval from the dean for that person (probably the candidate has some requests). Because sometimes dean's office can approve the final candidate after a few days since it should not be a long process. I am not sure which case is more likely. I know that I should be more patient, but it is honestly difficult!</p>\n<p>So, my question is about your experience with the hiring process and its timeline.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

The case for not responding is therefore even stronger (to the extent it needed any strengthening). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Should I inform Prof. A that I found this email inappropriate?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, you have been implicated in this business completely through the actions of others and have no duty to take any action. If you feel strongly enough about the inappropriate email that you feel compelled to write to Prof. A, go ahead. But there is absolutely no need to do so.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Should I just do as if I haven't read this email?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wouldn't falsely pretend that I haven't read the email, if that's what you mean - that would be dishonest and unprofessional (and besides, you have now documented publicly your knowledge of the email ;-)). Nor would I plan on saying (as Wolfgang Bangerth suggests in his answer) that I deleted it since it was \"none of my business\" (I don't think that unethical behavior by others is none of my business - it would be perfectly appropriate to consider it my business if I were so inclined). But as I said it would be completely appropriate to file the email away (or delete it, as you prefer) and take no further action. Whether you <em>should</em> do that depends on whether you are interested in getting involved in the story.</p>\n",
            " <p>If you have knowledge, independently of B's accusation, that A is behaving badly, it's up to you to join B or not, depending on how much you care. If you don't have any such knowledge then you shouldn't. </p>\n\n<p>If you have knowledge that B's accusations are wrong then you should inform B if you think B is mistaken, and you should inform A if you think B is intentionally spreading false accusations. If you have no knowledge that B's accusations are wrong then you may contact A about it or not, depending on how much you care.</p>\n\n<p>Consider that getting involved in any way may cause you inconvenience, and not getting involved when someone is wronged may cause you a bad conscience (or worse). </p>\n",

Most common questions can be answered by reviewing the <a href=\"https://nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappg18_1/index.jsp\" rel=\"noreferrer\">NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</a>. There is no single rule of thumb on how much to ask for, as the range of awards varies quite widely (and for the NSF is usually stated in Dear Colleague letters or public grant invitations on specific topics), but in general if you don't have a really good idea of how much things might cost to go into the budget for what to ask for, the panel will probably quickly notice you haven't thought things out in enough detail and reject it easily in an early round. You can be reasonably assured that someone - and probably many people - will look at each line item in a submitted budget, so they will need to be sensible, clearly defined, and obviously necessary or highly desirable for ensuring the success of the project. If the budget given does indeed seem arbitrary to someone who has looked at hundreds of grant requests in the last month (or week), that will not bode well for the likelihood of success.</p>\n\n<p>If you are affiliated with an institution that applies for NSF funding in general, there is probably a dedicated staff member (or a whole department) dedicated to supporting grant requests, so you should also definitely reach out to them to get information on what sort of support is available - which is much easier than trying to figure out everything on your own. They may have templates, workshops, guides, internal reviews, etc. - or at least, some institutions have all that. Check to see before doing it all the hard way.</p>\n",
            " <p>As a research administrator who has worked in CS, Electrical Engineering, and Chemistry and submitted applications to more than 15 federal sponsors in the last eight years, I recommend all PIs do four things when unfamiliar with a funding announcement:</p>\n\n<p>1) Review the program announcement, BAA, RFP, or solicitation for any explicit limitations.  Pay attention at the beginning to see if there are additional rules you must learn and adhere to-- NSF, NIH, DOD, and NASA all have additional rule books that are referenced in the solicitation.</p>\n\n<p>2) Go to the data repository for the sponsor (if federal) to see what kinds of projects are funded at what level.  (NSF is here:  <a href=\"https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/advancedSearch.jsp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/advancedSearch.jsp</a>) \n Some programs will be easy to search for with the advanced search.  E.g., \"CAREER\" requires the program name in the title.  Make sure you limit by directorate if applicable, as they do not have the same funding policies.</p>\n\n<p>3) Contact the program officer and ask what the expected funding levels are.  NSF is famous in some directorates for not posting a max, and yet actually having a maximum. I have heard faculty joke that NSF means \"Not Sufficiently Funded.\"  It's not a joke.</p>\n\n<p>4) Contact your assigned research administrator and ask for a budget.  You need to know if you are being realistic in your demands for your scope of work, but also for the specific program you are applying to.  Institution rules may limit your effort to an amount (perhaps 3 months, maybe more) or time frame (summer vs. calendar).

Most common questions can be answered by reviewing the <a href=\"https://nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappg18_1/index.jsp\" rel=\"noreferrer\">NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</a>. There is no single rule of thumb on how much to ask for, as the range of awards varies quite widely (and for the NSF is usually stated in Dear Colleague letters or public grant invitations on specific topics), but in general if you don't have a really good idea of how much things might cost to go into the budget for what to ask for, the panel will probably quickly notice you haven't thought things out in enough detail and reject it easily in an early round. You can be reasonably assured that someone - and probably many people - will look at each line item in a submitted budget, so they will need to be sensible, clearly defined, and obviously necessary or highly desirable for ensuring the success of the project. If the budget given does indeed seem arbitrary to someone who has looked at hundreds of grant requests in the last month (or week), that will not bode well for the likelihood of success.</p>\n\n<p>If you are affiliated with an institution that applies for NSF funding in general, there is probably a dedicated staff member (or a whole department) dedicated to supporting grant requests, so you should also definitely reach out to them to get information on what sort of support is available - which is much easier than trying to figure out everything on your own. They may have templates, workshops, guides, internal reviews, etc. - or at least, some institutions have all that. Check to see before doing it all the hard way.</p>\n",
        "rejected_target": " <p>As a research administrator who has worked in CS, Electrical Engineering, and Chemistry and submitted applications to more than 15 federal sponsors in the last eight years, I recommend all PIs do four things when unfamiliar with a funding announcement:</p>\n\n<p>1) Review the program announcement, BAA, RFP, or solicitation for any explicit limitations.  Pay attention at the beginning to see if there are additional rules you must learn and adhere to-- NSF, NIH, DOD, and NASA all have additional rule books that are referenced in the solicitation.</p>\n\n<p>2) Go to the data repository for the sponsor (if federal) to see what kinds of projects are funded at what level.  (NSF is here:  <a href=\"https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/advancedSearch.jsp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/advancedSearch.jsp</a>) \n Some programs will be easy to search for with the advanced search.  E.g., \"CAREER\" requires the program name in the title.  Make sure you limit by directorate if applicable, as they do not have the same funding policies.</p>\n\n<p>3) Contact the program officer and ask what the expected funding levels are.  NSF is famous in some directorates for not posting a max, and yet actually having a maximum. I have heard faculty joke that NSF means \"Not Sufficiently Funded.\"  It's not a joke.</p>\n\n<p>4) Contact your assigned research administrator and ask for a budget.  You need to know if you are being realistic in your demands for your scope of work, but also for the specific program you are applying to.  Institution rules may limit your effort to an amount (perhaps 3 months, maybe more) or time frame (summer vs. calendar).

Some publications won't consider things that have been previously &quot;published&quot; other than in certain restricted ways, such as a preprint server.</p>\n<p>A website <a href=\"https://writingcooperative.com/is-posting-on-social-media-publication-or-not-1f720e414c2c\" rel=\"noreferrer\">used by poets</a>, for example, suggests that some poetry publishers won't consider things posted online in any form, discouraging poets from tweeting their work. Poetry is a bit different from most academic publishing, of course, but it is a consideration.</p>\n<p>I'd suggest holding expressions of your ideas a bit closer until you have a publisher. There are other forms of communication that don't &quot;broadcast&quot; your expression. While there are some advantages in being widely seen, it seems to me to be better if it is a bit more formal. You also avoid the possible problem of attracting cranks.</p>\n",
            " <p>If your field widely uses preprints and conferences, it would be acceptable. ML/AI research is largely fine with it. Otherwise, abstain from doing that prior to publication. And not just because of copyright/possible scooping.</p>\n<p>Do not get me wrong, blogging about your research is great! But instead of the cutting edge ideas you have not even explored yourself in full, you might want to stick to general insights and &quot;current literature reviews&quot; instead. It would likely be a whole lot more digestible to your audience. One possible exception is providing updates on the experimental setup, the way CERN or NASA would do it. This gets into a very complex territory, however: sometimes the whole culture, from journals to the university press office, allows for that kind of dissemination, sometimes not. Even if such system is in place, it often would not be using a personal social media account. Derailing even further - if you have seen this type of social media posts in your field but not your university specifically, it might be plausible to float the idea around with the administration stating you would like to explore giving more visibility to your research using that venue.</p>\n<p>TL;DR: Do not do that unless you are in a field where it already is a big part of the research culture. If it is not obviously accepted, but you see a possibility of that being accepted, talk to relevant people first (PI, if you are not one, research administration, press office). All this provided that there are no known incidents in your field preventing people who did that from publishing.</p>\n",

There is a reason that the peer-review process exists, and prematurely reporting something, I think, can lead to the dilution the public's faith in science. For example, if there's a strong/bold conclusion from your work, and the public takes interest in this, then you've dug yourself a hole. I saw a scientist in my field do this (who doesn't like getting coverage by the BBC I guess), but they were torn apart by the field afterwards for publicizing results that were provocative and had not yet undergone the scrutiny of peer-review.

There are other forms of communication that don't &quot;broadcast&quot; your expression. While there are some advantages in being widely seen, it seems to me to be better if it is a bit more formal.

Otherwise, abstain from doing that prior to publication. And not just because of copyright/possible scooping.</p>\n<p>Do not get me wrong, blogging about your research is great! But instead of the cutting edge ideas you have not even explored yourself in full, you might want to stick to general insights and &quot;current literature reviews&quot; instead. It would likely be a whole lot more digestible to your audience. One possible exception is providing updates on the experimental setup, the way CERN or NASA would do it. This gets into a very complex territory, however: sometimes the whole culture, from journals to the university press office, allows for that kind of dissemination, sometimes not. Even if such system is in place, it often would not be using a personal social media account. Derailing even further - if you have seen this type of social media posts in your field but not your university specifically, it might be plausible to float the idea around with the administration stating you would like to explore giving more visibility to your research using that venue.</p>\n<p>TL;DR: Do not do that unless you are in a field where it already is a big part of the research culture. If it is not obviously accepted, but you see a possibility of that being accepted, talk to relevant people first (PI, if you are not one, research administration, press office). All this provided that there are no known incidents in your field preventing people who did that from publishing.</p>\n"

Now, I say 'relatively' because this is often hard to get right with the pressure of time and page limits; and with English not being the native language of most researches. So, readers will be somewhat tolerant about this point - but if you write something that is just very hard to follow, or in very poor English, that doesn't reflect well on you.</li>\n<li><p><strong>Unfortunately, attention must be paid to the venue of publication.</strong> I must first qualify that... obviously some publications are more highly-regarded w.r.t. their filtering process and the typical quality of articles they carry, and some less so. The thing is, I believe one should not assume that if a paper is published in a 'weaker' journal, that necessarily means it's bad - and if someone is evaluating your qualifications as an academic they should bother to skim the paper itself and make up their own mind. That doesn't always/often happen, so people may well judge your work by looking at where you've published. Of course, this is not something binary (\"good\" journals and \"bad\" journals, or conferences) -  but having mostly obscure venues in your list of publications does reflect poorly on you, and in some fields I guess there are venues you should actively avoid even at the price of no publication.</p>\n\n<p>Having said all that - for your first publication, as long as it's not a disreputable venue, it doesn't matter much. Most people \"start out small\".</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The last point, about venues, is also a sort of a safety guarantee for you: If you submit a paper to a conference or journal with a good peer-review process, and you're accepted, then it's highly likely that your paper is actually pretty good, and even more likely that it will reflect favorably on you (the converse is not necessarily true of course; lots of good papers get rejected).</p>\n"

Unique page numbering made the papers easy to find when you were down in the deep, dark, stacks, making a pile of journals for your trip to the photocopier.</p>\n\n<p>Also, what with similar journal names, special issues, supplements, etc., there was something to be said for the ability to notice that the book you were holding, the one that you were willing to put money on that it held the paper you were interested in, did not include the page number that the paper was supposed to be in.  Can't tell you why, but this was a problem that came up with some regularity.  I think this saved me plenty of time.</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I feel let down and (right now) rather upset about how I've been treated by an academic at another institution. Any tips for how I manage my (unavoidable) working relationship with him going forward?</p>\n\n<p>I'm a PhD Student in a small subdiscipline (only 2-4 of us in this country). He is a (moderately) established researcher and for him this is just one string to the fiddle. We've met a couple of times at conferences and organised a symposium together last year. I invited some of my non-academic network who are wonderful collaborators. </p>\n\n<p>After the symposium we discussed further work together. He asked if I would assist with chairing a (broad discipline) conference, and I was excited about us working together, thinking how great it was to have a good relationship with someone who was more focused on our subdiscipline than my supervisors are, and looking forward to post-PhD collaborations. I felt he was 'taking me under his wing' and that my expertise would be highly useful to him.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, the role we had discussed for conference organisation went to someone else, without him informing me. </p>\n\n<p>And I've found out he has been putting together a project proposal with my wonderful collaborators, without mentioning it to me. Naively, it never even occurred to me that someone would do this. It seems particularly weird because geographically I'm located right next to these collaborators, and there are plenty of similar organisations in his area that he could have reached out to.</p>\n\n<p>Right now I'm feeling pretty raw about this. (But perhaps this is on me? Was I simply too trusting?) But we are organising another symposium together. Undoubtedly we will cross paths again in the future, and will be reviewing each other's work. </p>\n\n<p>Any tips on how to manage this relationship going forward?

You don't own people. You established your relations with your network and these relations are still here.

Due to two incidents of equipment malfunctions (equipment that I am using), I was stopped from doing any experiments for more than three months in total. During the three months I did almost nothing. Over the entire 6 months that I have been here, I have only had one month during which I was able to generate any sufficient results (the other months I was learning the technique).  My supervisor rejected my proposal to switch to a new technique or use a different equipment set-up. What worries me is that I won't be able to gather sufficient results to write my thesis by July (which is the deadline), and I haven't even started my masters project.</p>\n\n<p>I am wondering whether anybody else has similarly experienced this situation before and whether this is normal during your PhD i.e. doing absolutely nothing for 3 months or more due to the excuse of \"equipment faults\"? Do you just switch to a different experiment or part of the project which utilize different techniques? Could somebody please help me understand why my supervisor is doing this - is this normal for labs which lack funding? </p>\n\n<p>What should I do? Should I make a formal complaint to the university about my masters supervisor? If I do so, I am afraid that the animosity between me and my supervisor will be beyond repair and he will not support me at all in finishing in time for the deadline. If it keeps on like this, I won't get enough results to sufficiently write the project thesis. </p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>A lot of it depends on how the network is configured, but most likely it will not work.  You also might not want to do it, because the connection may or may not be encrypted, so other users on the network would be able to sniff all the files being backed up to the device.  The best bet would probably be to use something like Dropbox if there are not gigs of data to be saved.   </p>\n",
            " <p>Extending the network might be a little fussy and require some help/advice/rights from the school, but that won't affect setting up the Time Capsule.</p>\n\n<p>This slightly defeats the point, but a Time Capsule can also run as a standalone unit in such a way where you don't have to get the cords out, but you switch to the offline Time Capsule network and make your wireless back up that way; sort of a one-to-one wireless network.</p>\n",

Unless the network is locked down with 802.1x or some web client for authentication, she will have no problems.</p>\n\n<p>There are ways to get around those issues, but it's a bit of a pain and not likely to be an issue either.</p>\n\n<p>And of course - If she gets an ethernet drop in the room, she can secure things much better. Her mac can be set to prefer her room's WiFi connection created from her TimeCapsule and she will get the benefit of less access to her TimeCapsule disk (only people she shares her WiFi password with can even see the volume) as well as possibly faster backups and internet access since her Mac to TimeCapsule throughput may very well be significantly faster than the WiFi throughput in her room to the nearest campus base station. It's likely there will be less other traffic on her private WiFi network as well so this is a superior option for the reasons listed.</p>\n",

If using a new network name with security on, then only your daughter would be able to see it and get on it.</p>\n\n<p>If the dorm tries to prevent the double NAT WiFi relay, you can use an Airport Express to pick up the dorm WiFi, then run an Ethernet cable from it to the TimeCapsule WAN port, and create a private WiFi for her and her other devices.</p>\n\n<p>I'm @terretta on Twitter if you need to reach me to discuss further.</p>\n",

Get one larger than the laptop's internal drive and configure it for Time Machine.</p>\n\n<p>If she just leaves it on her desk and learns to plug it in whenever she's working there with her computer, she'll be covered. As a recent college student (who used to advise his dorm-mates on that sort of thing), I'll attest that this is pretty easy for most people to condition themselves to do, and if it doesn't, it'll only take ONE case of data loss to teach them <em>soundly</em> how to practice good backup habits.</p>\n",

I also have an iPhone and I myself notice that it does not heat up if I am out in the open, but it heats up and drains the battery if I am in the basement of a large concrete building.</p>\n<h2>2. Case?</h2>\n<p>If you have a case for your iPhone, you should expect that it heats up. The case, while it does protect your phone, also blocks some air from coming out and consequently causes the hot air to be trapped inside the phone. This will cause your iPhone to heat up almost indefinitely.</p>\n<p><strong>Possible Solution</strong></p>\n<p>When you are charging your iPhone, take it out of its case. While this may be inconvenient, it will help.</p>\n<h2>3. CPU Usage</h2>\n<p>If your phone is heating up, you may have a lot of applications open. Also, if you were playing a lot of games, then you can expect an increase in CPU usage and temperature as well.</p>\n<p>All of the listed items below can contribute to an increase in CPU Usage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Games</li>\n<li>Data Usage (Facebook, Emails)</li>\n<li>Fetch/Push Data</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Possible Solutions</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Do a <code>Network Connections Reset</code> (Go to Settings =&gt; General =&gt; Reset =&gt; Reset Network Settings, then reboot (you will lose WiFi passwords)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Try disabling the following apps (in Settings =&gt; General =&gt; Restrictions): Multiplayer Games, Ping, App Store, iTunes Store.

This in turn uses more energy which causes the battery to heat up.</p>\n<p><strong>Possible Solution</strong></p>\n<p>You can try turning <code>Airplane Mode</code> on and see if you have the same problem with heating up.  I also have an iPhone and I myself notice that it does not heat up if I am out in the open, but it heats up and drains the battery if I am in the basement of a large concrete building.</p>\n<h2>2. Case?</h2>\n<p>If you have a case for your iPhone, you should expect that it heats up. The case, while it does protect your phone, also blocks some air from coming out and consequently causes the hot air to be trapped inside the phone. This will cause your iPhone to heat up almost indefinitely.</p>\n<p><strong>Possible Solution</strong></p>\n<p>When you are charging your iPhone, take it out of its case. While this may be inconvenient, it will help.</p>\n<h2>3. CPU Usage</h2>\n<p>If your phone is heating up, you may have a lot of applications open. Also, if you were playing a lot of games, then you can expect an increase in CPU usage and temperature as well.</p>\n<p>All of the listed items below can contribute to an increase in CPU Usage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Games</li>\n<li>Data Usage (Facebook, Emails)</li>\n<li>Fetch/Push Data</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Possible Solutions</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Do a <code>Network Connections Reset</code> (Go to Settings =&gt; General =&gt; Reset =&gt; Reset Network Settings, then reboot (you will lose WiFi passwords)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Try disabling the following apps (in Settings =&gt; General =&gt; Restrictions): Multiplayer Games, Ping, App Store, iTunes Store. Then reboot.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>4. Defect</h2>\n<p>If nothing else works, then it is also quite possible that your iPhone is defective and if this continues to occur as you have stated, I would take it to an Apple Store.

Besides using Python to get current GPS location, the author is building a GPS Radio Tracking System, and uses Python as the scripting language.</p>\n\n<p>However, for apps I use either techBASIC, or another basic called SmartBASIC. </p>\n\n<p>In one app I just use algebra and trig and geometry if I want to determine heading and using the built-in accelerometer, I can predict where the user will be in say 2 hours and produce a weather report by calculating what the anticipated GPS will be based on heading and speed of travel.</p>\n\n<p>Most languages will give you native GPS data, and in SmartBASIC, it will also give you an off-by error, a +/- reading as well.</p>\n\n<p>SmartBASIC, once you turn GPS on, it starts storing every point in an array, in case you are building an mapping app. You have access to all the past readings. If you want the current GPS, you need to loop your GPS call until there are no more readings.</p>\n\n<p>In techBASIC, you can specify a wait period, which I believe has the same function.</p>\n\n<p>I've tested both and the GPS readings are spot on. Even though you say the device's GPS sensor provides the same data, if you are not careful coding it, you will get different results.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck.</p>\n"

I followed the instructions on <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19038?locale=en_US\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page</a>, and nothing happened when I pressed command F2.  Then I started scouring the forums.  I found several threads with the same problem, and I tried all the suggestions.  I checked my preferences to see if the keyboard assignments were messed up.  I tried restarting both computers in various orders.  I tried using internal and external keyboards on both computers.  I tried adding the fn key to the key command.  I spent a couple hours on this, but sadly, nothing worked.</p>\n\n<p>So I'm really hoping that someone here has some idea what's going on.  This experience has really been disheartening.  I just bought these computers this year, and they failed at something so basic.  At this point, I would be satisfied just to see an error message telling me why cmd-F2 doesn't work.  I mean, if I try to eject a disk that has files that are currently in use, it will tell me why it can't eject right now.  But with this, I'm completely in the dark.  It's so frustrating!</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

For now, finder integration works for me. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you use the File -> Print option suggested in the accepted answer, Preview temporarily creates a file with name: Filename.pdf.pdf. This means that, when you accidentally make highlights, annotations on the temporary file, you'll loose your edits when you close that temporary file. On the other hand, when you use the \"open -n\" solution, two instances of Preview works on the very same files. Edits to any of the files are reflected to other instance when you save it. The only glitch is, after editing in one instance of preview when you save the file, the other instances scroll to the same page. This actually happens after some timer expires, even if you don't save the file. If this is annoying for you, the File->Print approach would work better. </p>\n\n<p>In the end, it is a plain shame that Apple does not implement a proper implementation of multiple views of same pdf document for Preview. Adobe Acrobat Reader does it very nicely, for example (Window -> New Window) however, for now, Adobe Reader has poor performance on Mac operating system, compared to Windows Operating system.  </p>\n"

The issue is that when copying the <code>.iso</code> to the USB it fails because the file <code>sources/install.wim</code> is 4.4GB. I can't format as exFAT because I cannot boot from that format and I cannot use FAT32 because of the 4.4GB file.

I am sure there are may other ways.</p>\n\n<h2>Answer #1</h2>\n\n<p>Mac computers running High Sierra or Mojave may be able to boot from USB flash drives that are ExFAT formatted. <em>So, Apple could fix this problem by changing to Boot Camp Assistant to format the USB flash drive as ExFAT instead of FAT32.</em> For now, you can use the following steps to create a USB Windows 10 flash drive installer.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Download the Windows 10 October 2018 Update ISO file from the Microsoft website <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Download Windows 10 Disc Image (ISO File)</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Use the Boot Camp Assistant application to download the Windows Support Software. Look for <code>Download the Windows Support Software</code> under <code>Action</code> on the Menu Bar. After the download finishes, the Window Support Software folder should appear as shown below.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2tmdS.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2tmdS.png\" alt=\"a2\"></a></p></li>\n<li><p>Use the Disk Utility application to erase a 16 GB or larger USB flash drive.

The name of the ISO file, I downloaded, was <code>Win10_1809Oct_English_x64.iso</code>. The volume name, when mounted, was <code>CCCOMA_X64FRE_EN-US_DV9</code>. Your names may be different.</p></li>\n<li><p>Use the Finder application to copy the contents of the ISO file to the USB flash drive. When finished, the root folder of the USB flash drive should appear as shown below.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s2VBd.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s2VBd.png\" alt=\"a1\"></a></p></li>\n<li><p>Use the Finder application to copy the Window Support Software to the USB flash drive.

If wish to use the flash drive to install Windows 10 on a different Mac, then you should replace the Windows Support Software files with ones downloaded on that Mac.</p>\n\n<h2>Answer #2</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This answer was suggested (in a now deleted comment) by <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/237687/solar-mike\">Solar Mike</a>. I will remove the answer, if he posts a similar answer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Use a machine running Windows to create the USB flash drive installer. At this point the flash drive does not contain the Windows Support Software provided by Apple. To add this software, follow steps 2 and 6 of Answer #1.</p>\n\n<p>When using the Windows operating system, you can download the application <code>MediaCreationTool1809.exe</code>. This allows the creation of either a USB flash drive installer or the download of an ISO file. <em>Mac users do not download an application. Instead, Mac users can only download the ISO file.</em> The MediaCreationTool1809 creates a FAT32 formatted USB installer. So there must be a difference between the files downloaded for the USB installer and the files downloaded in the ISO. I do not know how many of the files are different. However, I do know the largest file is different. This file contains all the Window 10 images. The MediaCreationTool1809 application creates the file <code>install.esd</code> which is 3.45 GB in size. This is nowhere near the 4 GB limit for files stored on FAT32 formatted volumes. Unfortunately, the ISO substitutes the file <code>install.wim</code> which is 4.4 GB in size. This is well over the 4 GB limit. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Either <code>.esd</code> files are more efficient in storage than <code>.wim</code> files or the <code>install.esd</code> file has less images than the <code>install.wim</code> file. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Answer #3</h2>\n\n<p>Download the Windows 10 April 2018 Update ISO file from the Microsoft website <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Download Windows 10 Disc Image (ISO File)</a>. This ISO file is compatible with the Boot Camp Assistant. After using the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows 10, you should goto the Microsoft website <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Download Windows 10</a> to upgrade to the Windows 10 October 2018 Update. <strong>Note: This last link will only work when booted to Windows.

Now copy your large wim file to C:\\wim.</p></li>\n<li><p>Type the following command, which will split your wim file into smaller sizes, which will fit perfectly on a FAT32 USB stick:</p>\n\n<p>dism /split-image /ImageFile:C:\\wim\\install.wim /SWMFile:C:\\wim\\split\\install.swm /FileSize:2000</p></li>\n<li><p>Now delete the wim file off of your USB stick (in the sources folder) and replace it with the several .swm files in the C:\\wim\\split folder.  Because we said filesize=2000, it will split the wim file into approx 2GB files.  Had we said 1000, it would be approx 1GB files.</p></li>\n<li><p>Now you don't have to mess around with alternate file systems.  Use the media creation tool from Microsoft to build your USB stick, then delete the .esd file out of the \"sources\" folder on the USB stick, then put these split install.swm files in its place.  As long as they are named \"install.swm, install2.swm, etc,\" Windows will treat them like a standard wim file and install Windows normally.</p></li>\n</ul>\n",

Then went to that window's top bar and double clicked. The next window was still a chrome window, but the content of the webpage wasn't interactable. On it, the mouse then zoomed in, dragged around a little, then went to the top of the screen and double clicked a running application's menu bar icon. Incidentally, this triggered a macOS dialog box to open asking me if I'd like to grant permission to the application to register all key events from all applications.</p>\n<p>At this point I immediately stepped in and started moving the mouse around to prevent it from hitting accept. I think it's important to note here that the mouse wasn't moving like a person would move it, but jumping from point to point. Despite intervening, the mouse just kept exhibiting what seemed like programmed behavior. Then in an effort to prevent any more activity I locked the screen. To my surprise, the behavior continued, then after several minutes stopped on its own.</p>\n<p>Not long after \u2014\u00a0perhaps 20 minutes \u2014\u00a0it started exhibiting what appeared to be the same pattern of motion (moving up, double clicking, moving to the center, clicking, etc.).

Here's what my settings looked like:\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PikD8.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PikD8.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>For me, it was fixed somehow by an SMC reset <em>with the charger disconnected, <strong>while powered on</em></strong>. Basically, I pressed <code>Control + Shift + Option + Power button</code>. <strong><em>The system instantly shut down without warning</em></strong>. Force touch and haptic feedback were back when the system turned on.</p>\n\n<p><sub><sub>Do I recommend this? No. It's an unclean shutdown. Did it work? Yes it did.</sub></sub></p>\n",
            " <p>Same problem, but the SMC reset (Control + Option + Shift + power button) fixed it. </p>\n",
            " <p>I tried some of the methods suggested here but none of them worked.\nThen I realized there's a toggle button on the trackpad, I turned it on/off and that worked for me. Note: I have an external trackpad.</p>\n",
            " <p>I had the exact same issue which happened without any warning or damage to the computer. I tried restarting manually and updating software; it did not work. However, I came across this website and the option of the control + shift + option + power button worked beautifully for me. Weirdly, I had to press the option button on the same side of the control button. If I tried to press it on the opposite side the computer would not shut down or restart. As soon as it rebooted with the hard reset, the trackpad haptic click was working again.</p>\n",
            " <p>I have just had this problem.  I have a bluetooth trackpad that I occasionally use.  It was under a pile of books and so was being pressed. It took me 45 minutes to figure out why my internal trackpad and an external mouse wouldn't click after I logged in (but did work before I logged in).</p>\n",
            " <p>Sadly with 3 years of dealing with this situation with all possible manual methods and recently I have had time to contact Apple Care.\nAnd then they conclude that is the fault of the hardware!\nThe last thing that I can do now is to disable the Force Touch Trackpad apple that was first introduced on the Macbook Pro 2015.\nYou will not see the error can not zoom, back page ... Lost Force touch feature (or force feedback), although it is still better than the previous MacBook Trackpad, but the above shows it is the biggest disappointment for the Macbook Pro 13 user community - the Force Track Trackpad 2015 in general!</p>\n",
            " <p>My haptic feedback stopped working and I did all the recommendations (reset SMC, PRAM, etc.) and nothing worked.  Called apple support and no help either.  They sent me to apple store and after spending 2 hours there running some weird tests I was told &quot;sorry you should change your trackpad&quot;.<br />\nHow much?  $650. !!!!</p>\n<p>I came home and decided to purchase the trackpad and fix it myself but out of desperation picked up a paper and slide it through the trackpad sides and gently start moving the paper.  Some dust fluff started to come out and suddenly my trackpad started working.</p>\n<p>That's it,  just a lousy dust</p>\n",
            " <p>I had the above mentioned issue and tried all the solutions listed, all without result and almost issued a ticket with Apple.\nFinally I decided to drain the battery, I started Netflix and left the laptop running until it died. Left it overnight, plugged power in and my trackpad's haptic is working again !</p>\n<p>I hope somebody may benefit from this option</p>\n"

            " <p>I had a need to do this today and I saw your question, so here is a protocol of the steps I took.</p>\n<h1>Find the Device Number</h1>\n<p><code>diskutil list</code>\ne.g. 2, as in <code>/dev/disk2</code>\n<strong>Assuming <code>2</code> for the rest of the instructions.</strong></p>\n<h1>Create the Virtual Machine VMDK</h1>\n<p><code>VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename &quot;$HOME/dev-disk2.vmdk&quot; -rawdisk /dev/disk2</code></p>\n<p>Eject the device before this step, otherwise you will get an error: <code>VERR_RESOURCE_BUSY</code>. You may want to add an entry in <code>fstab</code> with the added parameters <code>noauto</code> to prevent the OS from remounting the drive.</p>\n<p>I use <code>rdisk-disk2.vmdk</code> for the name, because this virtual machine is just a pointer to this device. After reboot, the situation could change e.g. a device might be assigned a different number especially if you unplug things and move things around.</p>\n<h1>Start Virtual Box Manager with Root Privileges</h1>\n<p><code>sudo /Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/MacOS/VirtualBox</code></p>\n<p>Because devices are all owned by root, you need to start VirtualBox with root privileges. This has consequences. Your home context (home folder and preferences) will be changed to root. Your other virtual machines will not be visible. If you open a file browser, you will see the root's home folder by default.</p>\n<p>Another option is to change the permissions of the device (not recommended) as you have done.</p>\n<p>To confirm permissions of devices, you can run <code>ls -l /dev/disk*</code></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add New Machine, provide name: /dev/disk2, type: linux, version: arch linux (64-bit)</li>\n<li>Give it some memory (whatever you can)</li>\n<li>Select existing drive using VMDK created above. (<strong>IMPORTANT</strong> ensure the drive has not been remounted, otherwise you will get <code>VERR_RESOURCE_BUSY</code>, <code>NS_ERROR_FAILURE</code>)</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Install a Fresh System</h1>\n<p>Add an optical disk file (e.g. a bootable linux ISO of your liking) and turn on the Live CD/DVD optional so that you boot from it.</p>\n<h1>Make System Bootable in VirtualBox</h1>\n<p>This is not so obvious, especially if you use an EFI setup. If using <code>grub-mkconfig</code>, the name of the efi file is grubx64.efi (assuming 64 bits). VirtualBox is finicky about where it looks for a boot file. The default will not do.</p>\n<p>Rename <code>grubx64.efi</code> to <code>bootx64.efi</code></p>\n<p><code>/boot/EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi</code></p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Notes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>tip: get yourself iterm 2</li>\n<li>This is super useful for Macbooks when installing Arch Linux, because the default ISO does not load the wlan card drivers.</li>\n</ul>\n",

You may want to add an entry in <code>fstab</code> with the added parameters <code>noauto</code> to prevent the OS from remounting the drive.</p>\n<p>I use <code>rdisk-disk2.vmdk</code> for the name, because this virtual machine is just a pointer to this device.

This has consequences. Your home context (home folder and preferences) will be changed to root. Your other virtual machines will not be visible. If you open a file browser, you will see the root's home folder by default.</p>\n<p>Another option is to change the permissions of the device (not recommended) as you have done.</p>\n<p>To confirm permissions of devices, you can run <code>ls -l /dev/disk*</code></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add New Machine, provide name: /dev/disk2, type: linux, version: arch linux (64-bit)</li>\n<li>Give it some memory (whatever you can)</li>\n<li>Select existing drive using VMDK created above.

If using <code>grub-mkconfig</code>, the name of the efi file is grubx64.efi (assuming 64 bits). VirtualBox is finicky about where it looks for a boot file.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Let me begin by saying I'm not new to LUKS. I've set up LUKS with keyscripts numerous times with and without LVM. I'm not sure what is actually going on here though. I have a system that has a single encrypted partition. My drive is organized as follows:</p>\n\n<pre>\n# lsblk\n\nNAME             MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINT\nsda                8:0    0  128G  0 disk  \n\u2514\u2500sda1             8:1    0  128G  0 part  \n  \u251c\u2500vg0-root     253:1    0   20G  0 lvm   /\n  \u251c\u2500vg0-secure   253:6    0  100M  0 lvm   \n  \u2502 \u2514\u2500secure     253:7    0   98M  0 crypt /root/secure\n  \u2514\u2500vg0-swap     253:4    0    1G  0 lvm   [SWAP]\n\n</pre>\n\n<p>My <code>/etc/crypttab</code> file looks something like this</p>\n\n<pre>\n# UUID is not required here since the path to the LV won't change\nsecure      /dev/vg0/secure       none      luks,keyscript=/lib/cryptsetup/scripts/insecure\n</pre>\n\n<p>My <code>/lib/cryptsetup/scripts/insecure</code> file is executable and looks something like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>#!/bin/sh\n# My actual file looks somewhat different because it dumps the key file with dd.\n# This accomplishes virtually the same thing though.\n\necho -n \"my-encryption-password\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have run <code>update-initramfs -k all -u</code> a number of times after configuring crypttab and putting my keyscript file in place.</p>\n\n<p><strike>As far as I can tell, my script file isn't even getting copied to the initrd.img file.</strike> Now that I think about it, I don't think it would get copied to the initrd.img file since the root partition is not encrypted and the script file should be easily accessible from there.</p>\n\n<p>Upon rebooting, the system sees the record from crypttab and asks for a password (which in my case doesn't actually exist because the only key is a keyfile full of random bits) rather than using the keyscript to unlock the LUKS partition. I have tried taking LUKS out of the LVM and putting it on sda2, and the results were the same. I also know that the keyscript works because <code>cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/vg0/secure secure -d - &lt;&lt;&lt; \"$(/lib/cryptsetup/scripts/insecure)\"</code> works like a charm and decrypts my LUKS partition.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried this in Ubuntu 16.04.2 and Ubuntu Mate 16.04.2 with the same results. I've used keyscripts before without any trouble. The only difference was that, in the past, my / partition was always encrypted. If anyone can shed some light, I'd appreciate it. I only want a very small encrypted partition because I plan on cloning this system, and I don't want to clone it with the entire / partition encrypted.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2017-04-26</strong></p>\n\n<p>In digging through logs, I found a line with the following error which makes no sense. Since when is 'keyscript=/path/to/script' an unknown option for crypttab?</p>\n\n<pre>\n... systemd-cryptsetup[737]: Encountered unknown /etc/crypttab option 'keyscript=/lib/cryptsetup/scripts/insecure', ignoring.\n</pre>\n\n<p>Just for kicks, I tried removing the keyscript option and using a keyfile, and it all just worked! In fact, I tried other options like keyfile-offset, and they work too. Hence, the problem lies somewhere with the keyscript option. Does anyone have any idea why?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

So the main part of this will be made by your multimedia data, the rest should not take more than a GB or so. </p>\n\n<p>For swap, I think it is recommended to give it about the same size as your RAM, a bit bigger if you want to use it for hibernation (not recommended since version 12 ?)</p>\n\n<p>But about the file systems: Ubuntu's default file system for data partitions (all except swap) is ext4! I would suggest you to use this instead of old FAT or windows' newer NTFS. You would not be able to access the files on a ext4 volume from within windows without additional drivers, but for Ubuntu, it has several advantages, e.g. it does not require any defragging and provides always high data transfer speed. As a workaround, you could allocate another partition in NTFS or FAT32 where you can copy the Ubuntu files you have to access from Windows too (the other direction works directly). For swap, you of course use linux-swap.</p>\n",
            " <p>Yeah, you should install windows first. However, during linux installation, when partitioning it is important to have a separate /home partition so that in case of computer or reinstallation later you can select that same partition for home instead of allocating new space. This way you can prevent loss of data. You could additionally do this for /var, /tmp etc but that's a personal preference or if you have a large system with lots of users</p>\n"

            " <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: EOF is not a character, it's a macro used for evaluating negative return of an input-reading function. One can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> to send <code>EOT</code> character which will force function return <code>-1</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>Every programmer must RTFM</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let us refer to  \"C A Reference Manual\", by Harbison and Steele, 4th ed. from 1995, page 317:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The negative integer EOF is a value that is not an encoding of a \"real\n  character\" . . . For example fget (section 15.6) <strong>returns  EOF</strong> when\n  at end-of-file, because there is no \"real character\" to be read.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Essentially <code>EOF</code> isn't a character, but rather an <strong>integer value</strong> implemented in <code>stdio.h</code> to represent <code>-1</code>. Thus, kos's answer is correct as far as that goes, but it's not about receiving \"empty\" input. Important note is that  here EOF serves as <em>return value</em> (of <code>getchar()</code>) comparison , not to signify an actual character. The <code>man getchar</code> supports that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>RETURN VALUE</p>\n  \n  <p>fgetc(), getc() and getchar() return the character read as an  unsigned\n    char cast to an int or EOF on end of file or error.</p>\n  \n  <p>gets()  and  fgets() return s on success, and NULL on error or when end\n    of file occurs while no characters have been read.</p>\n  \n  <p>ungetc() returns c on success, or EOF on error.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Consider the <code>while</code> loop - its primary purpose is to repeat action <em>if condition in the brackets is true</em>. Look again:</p>\n\n<pre><code>while ((c = getchar ()) != EOF)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It basically says   keep doing stuff if  <code>c =  getchar()</code> returns successful code (<code>0</code> or above ; it's a common thing by the way, try running successful command, then <code>echo $?</code> and then failed <code>echo $?</code> and see numbers they return ).   So if we successfully get character and assing to C , returned status code is 0, failed is -1. <code>EOF</code> is defined as <code>-1</code>.  Therefore  when condition <code>-1 == -1</code> occurs, loops stops. And when will that happen ? When there is no more character to get, when <code>c = getchar()</code> fails. You could write <code>while ((c = getchar ()) != -1)</code> and it still would work</p>\n\n<p>Also, let's go back to the actual code, here's an excerpt from <code>stdio.h</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>/* End of file character.\n   Some things throughout the library rely on this being -1.  */\n#ifndef EOF\n# define EOF (-1)\n#endif\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>ASCII codes and EOT</strong></p>\n\n<p>Although EOF character is not an actual character, however, there exists an <code>EOT</code> (End of Transmission) character, which has ASCII decimal value of 04; it is linked to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> shortcut ( represented also as meta character <code>^D</code>). The end of transmission chracter used to signify closing of a stream of data way back when computers were used to control telephone connections , hence \"end of transmission\" naming. </p>\n\n<p>So it is possible to send that ascii value to the program like so, note the <code>$'\\04'</code> which is the EOT:</p>\n\n<pre><code>skolodya@ubuntu:$ ./a.out  &lt;&lt;&lt; \"a,b,c $'\\04'\"                                  \ndigits = 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0, white space = 2, other = 9\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thus , we can say that it does exists, but it is not printable</p>\n\n<p><strong>Side Note</strong></p>\n\n<p>We often forget that in the past computers weren't as versatile - designers has to make use of every keyboard key available. Thus , sending <code>EOT</code> character with CtrlD is still \"sending a character\" , not unlike typing capital A, ShiftA, you still make give computer an input with available keys. Thus EOT is a real character in a sense that it does come from user, it is readable by computer (though not printable, non visible by humans), it exists in computer memory</p>\n\n<p><strong>Byte Commander's comment</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you try to read from /dev/null, that should return an EOF as well,\n  right? Or what do I get there?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, exactly right, because in <code>/dev/null</code> there is no actual character to be read , hence it <code>c = getchar()</code> will return <code>-1</code> code, and program will quit right away. Again <strong>command doesn't return EOF. EOF is just constant variable equal to -1 , which we use to compare return code of getchar function</strong>. <code>EOF</code> doesn't exist as character, it's just a static value inside <code>stdio.h</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Demo:</p>\n\n<pre><code># cat /dev/null shows there's no readable chars\nDIR:/xieerqi\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ cat /dev/null | cat -A        \n\n# Bellow is simple program that will open /dev/null for reading.

            " <p>Of course one will want both pulseaudio and jack running if they got to the point where they need jack as most browser media players don't know jack! ..unfortunately. </p>\n\n<p>I kept seeing the suggestion of having just one of them running at a time which seems to me like such a terrible compromise. It's a bit tragic in my opinion that these two services i.e. jack and pulseaudio although both functional on their own are so poorly managed by kxstudio at least which is what I'm using.</p>\n\n<p>So what happens is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>jack cannot start while pulseaudio is running (and using the soundcard driver it wants to use which is fair enough) so it needs to be started first</p></li>\n<li><p>pulseaudio needs to be pointed to jack once both up and running</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Pretty simple..ey? For certain reasons, I had endless grief with it cuz..</p>\n\n<p>First I think because pulseaudio 4.0 seems be buggy and mess up the alsa driver so that in some situations it leaves it locked and therefore jack cannot start even though pulseaudio is not running.  (Says failed to set capture parameters or smtg like that)</p>\n\n<p>What I deed in the end was </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>removed both jack and pulseaudio completely (with find and rm -rf :D after apt-get purge)</li>\n<li>installed pulseaudio 11 (from sources)</li>\n<li>installed jack and it's libs (libjack-dev)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>in this order and then I finally got them running normally through qjackctl which makes sure they start in the correct manner (loads the jack sink in pulseaudio, and sets it as default). </p>\n\n<p>Btw, I saw Cadence is recommended instead and I don't understand why as to me it seems rubbish compared to qjackctl.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, problem is starting jack using qjackctl takes a while and to avoid the waiting times at each boot you can use this life saver feature of kde which is to load previous session. Make sure you don't have qjackctl in autostart though as you will end up with one more instance at each reboot regardless of the singleton = true setting (buggy buggy all night long).</p>\n\n<p>This is because I didn't feel fiddling around with it any longer such as  writing a smart script that will make sure pulseaudio is down (or suspended) start jack and check that it started properly, then start pulseaudio, load jack module etc. </p>\n\n<p>Otherwise relying on the OS to start the daemons and load config correctly would be the normal (healthy) scenario however it doesn't seem to be happening.</p>\n\n<p>Have fun..</p>\n",

This is supposed to tell pulseaudio to temporarily let jack manage the sound card. I'm not sure if it's really required, but I guess it cannot hurt:\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VOcU5.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VOcU5.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Then, in the tab &quot;Options&quot;, put in the <code>Execute script after Startup</code> the following code:</p>\n<pre><code>pactl load-module module-jack-sink &amp;&amp; pactl load-module module-jack-source &amp;&amp; pactl set-default-sink jack_out &amp;&amp; pacmd set-default-source jack_in &amp;&amp; pacmd list-sink-inputs | grep index | sed 's/ *index: *//g' | xargs -I{} pacmd move-sink-input &quot;{}&quot; jack_out\n</code></pre>\n<p>The goal of this command is to create new outputs (sink) to pulseaudio that points to jack, to enable this new sink by default (all newly open applications will write to jack), and it also change the output of all the existing applications to make sure they point to jack.</p>\n<p>Then, to make sure pulseaudio restarts when jack is closed, I also added in the field <code>Execute script after Shutdown</code> :</p>\n<pre><code>pacmd suspend false\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4hQn4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4hQn4.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>That's it! Now, you just need to save by clicking on <code>Apply</code> and to click on <code>Start</code> to start jack:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hmhyY.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hmhyY.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a>\nYou should see something like that if it works (and of course no errors):\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ToXmO.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ToXmO.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<h1>A bit of theory to understand why it works, or why it fails</h1>\n<p>So basically, you can't play sound because only one program can play sound at the same time on the same sound card. So when Jack is playing, pulseaudio is blocked. Now, it also turns out that most desktop applications can talk to pulseaudio but not to Jack. So when Jack is on, you just don't have sound anymore. The trick is to route the pulseaudio trafic to Jack with something like that:</p>\n<pre><code>application -&gt; pulseaudio -&gt; Jack -&gt; sound card\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that all links must be correctly configured. We will see now how they are configured and how to check if they are configured correctly.</p>\n<p>So to create the link <code>pulseaudio -&gt; Jack</code> we are going to load a module that creates a new pulseaudio sink (i.e. a virtual output device) called <code>Jack sink</code>: that way any applications writing in that sink will be redirected on Jack. You could have several already existing sinks, like one for the internal audio, and if you have a bluetooth headset, you can have one sink for it too. To check on which sink an application is actually playing, install and run <code>pavucontrol</code> (<code>pavucontrol</code> is super useful anyway for all sound-related stuff, since you can control basically everything from it). You can see the list of sinks in a tab named like <code>Input devices</code> (sorry if the translation is bad), in my case I have right now 2 sinks (jack is not yet loaded):\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rWrSe.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rWrSe.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you just have one sink, you may not see anything interesting, but if you have several sinks, you can check in the first tab which application is playing on which sink (here you see that firefox is playing on my bluetooth headset), and you can change it if needed:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/27GLK.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/27GLK.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>So if you have some issues, you can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>link <code>pulseaudio -&gt; jack</code>: check that you have a sink corresponding to jack (if not, try to run manually the command <code>pactl load-module module-jack-sink</code> that was supposed to be run automatically. If it fails, make sure you installed the <code>pulseaudio-module-jack</code>, and eventually restart pulseaudio by simply killing it <code>killall pulseaudio</code>. No worries, no need to restart pulseaudio, it respawn automatically.). Also make sure that the volume is not 0%, and that the channel is not muted:\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aTVCM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aTVCM.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></li>\n<li>link <code>application -&gt; pulseaudio</code>: check that your applications are writing on that sink. If not, you can manually change the sink (but the startup script was supposed to change the sink automatically) that way:\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KhCJJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KhCJJ.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></li>\n<li>link <code>jack -&gt; sound card</code>: If you still have troubles (this part could also concern a trouble you have with the softwares that write on jack directly like <code>zynaddsubfx</code>), check out the <code>Graph</code> part of jack:</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/682gh.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/682gh.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>You should start will all nodes packed together, but you can move them to make them easier to see. Then make sure that all applications you want to ear are connected to <code>system</code> (in my case <code>zynaddsubfx</code> was not connected automatically). NB: if you have an older version of QJackctl, then you may have tabs instead of this. But it's the same: you will have green inputs/outputs in the &quot;Jack&quot; tab that you can manually connect, the violet ones will be in the &quot;Alsa&quot; tab, and the red ones in the &quot;MIDI&quot; tab... but in fact all external MIDI devices that you plug will appear in the Alsa tab: the reason is that there are two kinds of &quot;MIDI&quot;: the legacy Alsa Midi (ports are global to the system), and the more recent Jack Midi (each application can have its own midi input/outputs).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/c4JDc.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/c4JDc.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Troubles with MIDI: In theory, to get midi, you can just connect the violet inputs to violet inputs (or in the Alsa tab in the older version, yes I know it's strange that you need to go in Alsa tab and not Midi to get Midi(!!!) but it's because of the difference between Alsa MIDI vs the more recent but less used Jack Midi). However, it turns out that for some strange reasons, <code>zynaddsubfx</code> has some strange defaults values and will appear as &quot;Midi/red&quot; instead of &quot;Alsa/green&quot;, making it impossible to connect to an external midi device. More precisely, if you run <code>zynaddsubfx</code> from the command line without any option or with:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>zynaddsubfx -I alsa -O jack\n</code></pre>\n<p>(which means input from Alsa MIDI, output to jack) it should not be a problem, you will be able to connect the MIDI devices:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YSzvn.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YSzvn.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>However, if you run it in a graphical way, the default Jack entry automatically runs <code>zynaddsubfx -I jack -O jack</code> instead... And it will have the issue that the <code>zynaddsubfx</code> input will be created in red/MIDI tab, while the actual external MIDI device is in violet/Alsa tab. So it means that you won't be able to map your external midi keyboard to <code>zynaddsubfx</code>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hKDPu.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hKDPu.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>The solution is therefore to run <code>zynaddsubfx</code> using command line without options, or with <code>zynaddsubfx -I alsa -O midi</code> and everything should work!</p>\n"

Copy it into \"Setup...\" > \"Options\" > \"Execute script after Startup\":</p>\n\n<pre><code>pacmd set-default-sink jack_out\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And that's it. Pulseaudio will recognize (through D-Bus) that JACK started, and automatically will route audio to it. When JACK is stopped Pulseaudio will revert to normal routing and start sending audio directly to card again.</p>\n\n<p>So (almost) by default Pulseaudio implements the setup detailed above by mmv-ru.</p>\n",
        "rejected_target": " <p>Of course one will want both pulseaudio and jack running if they got to the point where they need jack as most browser media players don't know jack! ..unfortunately. </p>\n\n<p>I kept seeing the suggestion of having just one of them running at a time which seems to me like such a terrible compromise. It's a bit tragic in my opinion that these two services i.e. jack and pulseaudio although both functional on their own are so poorly managed by kxstudio at least which is what I'm using.</p>\n\n<p>So what happens is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>jack cannot start while pulseaudio is running (and using the soundcard driver it wants to use which is fair enough) so it needs to be started first</p></li>\n<li><p>pulseaudio needs to be pointed to jack once both up and running</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Pretty simple..ey? For certain reasons, I had endless grief with it cuz..</p>\n\n<p>First I think because pulseaudio 4.0 seems be buggy and mess up the alsa driver so that in some situations it leaves it locked and therefore jack cannot start even though pulseaudio is not running.  (Says failed to set capture parameters or smtg like that)</p>\n\n<p>What I deed in the end was </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>removed both jack and pulseaudio completely (with find and rm -rf :D after apt-get purge)</li>\n<li>installed pulseaudio 11 (from sources)</li>\n<li>installed jack and it's libs (libjack-dev)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>in this order and then I finally got them running normally through qjackctl which makes sure they start in the correct manner (loads the jack sink in pulseaudio, and sets it as default). </p>\n\n<p>Btw, I saw Cadence is recommended instead and I don't understand why as to me it seems rubbish compared to qjackctl.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, problem is starting jack using qjackctl takes a while and to avoid the waiting times at each boot you can use this life saver feature of kde which is to load previous session. Make sure you don't have qjackctl in autostart though as you will end up with one more instance at each reboot regardless of the singleton = true setting (buggy buggy all night long).</p>\n\n<p>This is because I didn't feel fiddling around with it any longer such as  writing a smart script that will make sure pulseaudio is down (or suspended) start jack and check that it started properly, then start pulseaudio, load jack module etc. </p>\n\n<p>Otherwise relying on the OS to start the daemons and load config correctly would be the normal (healthy) scenario however it doesn't seem to be happening.</p>\n\n<p>Have fun..</p>\n"

I'm not sure what the guise who let the present Opera package into the repos were smoking, but apparently they did not test it against older but still living LTS (Long Term Support) versions of \"supported\" Debian-based operating systems before doing so.  </p>\n\n<p>If this ever happens to a system you're in charge of - update attempts returning \"error code 1\" and no changes made because of broken junk - here's a simple fix that works.  Pop open a terminal and do:</p>\n\n<p>cd /var/lib/dpkg/info/</p>\n\n<p>This gets you to the directory where dpkg stores its configuration files related to installed software.  Then do:</p>\n\n<p>ls | grep -i opera </p>\n\n<p>(replace \"opera\" with whatever package broke your package manager)</p>\n\n<p>This command lists every file with \"Opera\" or etc. in its name.  Look them over:  Is anything /not/ related to Opera (or whatever) listed?  If so, take note and delete only the \"offending\" package's files one at a time, using their full names, to avoid breaking other things with similar names.  But if all the returns from your search obviously belong to the borken package, do:</p>\n\n<p>sudo rm <em>opera</em></p>\n\n<p>... replacing \"opera\" with whatever junk has disabled your package manager.  </p>\n\n<p>Result:  The half-installed broken package will sit on your hard drive \"forever\", an Mortal Insult to All That Is Good And Holy - but doing no actual harm of any kind other than wasting a few MB of drive space.  Unless you go into you /bin directory and remove them by hand.  Either way, you can now update your installed software, install new packages, etc. normally, because your package manager no longer knows that the failed package and its borken parts ever existed.</p>\n",

But according to the (wrong) manual I was reading, I also had to run <code>btrfs filesystem balance</code> and this apparently converted my filesystem to \"raid1\" mode so everything is stored redundantly twice - once on each drive, and I can only use 50% of my total capacity:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ btrfs filesystem df /\nData, RAID0: total=78.00GB, used=41.57GB\nSystem, RAID1: total=8.00MB, used=16.00KB\nSystem: total=4.00MB, used=0.00\nMetadata, RAID1: total=3.75GB, used=355.06MB\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Its a nice feature, but I was kind of wanting to use \"raid0\" (stripping). I've tried to remove the new device so I can re-add it, but when I try that I get an error and syslog has this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>btrfs: unable to go below two devices on raid1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So my question is: how can I convert my filesystem back to raid0 so I can use the total space of both disks?</p>\n\n<p>(*) Like can be done with LVM, but with btrfs you can host multiple \"partitions\" on the same \"file system\" and space is allocated dynamically where you need it - unlike in LVM.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

Just install using CLI with:</p>\n<p>apt-get install gpointing-device-settings</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then invoke <code>gpointing-device-settings</code> to get the gui window.\n<strong>Remark</strong>: There is an unfixed bug in newer Ubuntus that wipes out your settings when rebooting. You may put <code>gpointing-device-settings</code> in auto-start but still need to prompt then. I am not aware of any proper config solution.</p>\n<p>Probably some steps need a sudo or root access. I assume you know.</p>\n<p>However, now I can use the unixish copy paste by mark and middle mouse button. At least in terminal.\nAnd for the Marble Mouse there is a separate article with a lot of config details.</p>\n<h2>Addendum</h2>\n<p>With Ubuntu 17 and in XFCE the middle mouse button copy paste did not work at all.</p>\n<p>Wayland is different.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it is helpful to enter</p>\n<pre><code>gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.mouse middle-button-enabled true\n</code></pre>\n<p>With some luck it is persistent.

Normally you would say, \"That was too stupid a question\" or \"That was a stupid question\". </p>\n\n<p>Note that you don't necessarily need a quantity when you use the plural. For example in the singular you cannot say, \"There was dog in the room\", you must say, \"There was a dog in the room\" or \"There was one dog in the room\". But in the plural you can say, \"There were dogs in the room.\" You CAN give a quantity, like \"There were two dogs in the room\" or \"There were many dogs in the room\", but you don't have to.

            " <p>I think the simple answer to this is that you <em>do</em> need to use the article, but that one definition of <em>no</em> is \"not a\", meaning that using <em>no</em> on its own can imply the article anyway, as in:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He's no genius. (He's not a genius)<br>\n  It's no joke. (It's not a joke)<br>\n  No one may leave. (Not a/any one/person may leave)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, you can say \"It's no big deal\", as you may also say \"It was no stupid question\", but because no definitions of <em>too</em> include an article, you have to explicitly use the article with <em>too</em>.</p>\n",
            " <p>For what it might be worth, I find that \"of a deal\" is a prepositional phrase that modifies the adjective \"big\"; you would be left with the main sentence, \"It's not that big.\"  While adjectives can certainly be used as nouns (\"the good, the bad, and the ugly\"), this is usually the case when there is an understood noun to which the adjectives apply (\"people\").  \"It's not that big.\" is a bit awkward and very conversational, on the level of \"no big\".  I prefer \"It's not that big a deal.\" as the more straightforward option.  However the comment in the thread noting that English tends to be defined by usage is right, so way what you will.</p>\n"

            " <p>The closest that I can think of is <strong><em>virtue</em></strong>.  The Roman Catholic Church contrasts the Seven Deadly Sins with the Seven Cardinal Virtues.  However, the word is not normally used by itself to describe a particular act, only a trait (or set of traits: patience, prudence, courage, etc.). It is commonly used in the adjectival form \"virtuous\", so you could say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have committed a sin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have performed a virtuous act.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
            " <p>I've seen <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mitzva\"><em>mitzva</em></a> used.</p>\n",
            " <p>English does not have a precise word for the opposite of <em>sin</em> in the sense you mean, so you'll have to be content with adjectives: the opposite of \"I committed a sin\" would be \"I performed a good/virtuous/righteous/moral/meritorious &nbsp;act/deed\". (Note that the noun forms of these adjectives won't work: <em>goodness</em> has a very wide range of meanings; <em>virtue</em> refers to qualities inhering in a person and carries no connotation of action unlike <em>virtuous act</em> which does, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>As you're writing for an Indian audience, the word you have in mind that's already familiar to your audience (<em>pun&#803;ya</em>) is a perfectly good choice to use. The criterion should not be whether a certain word exists in an English dictionary or not, but whether your audience will understand the word or not.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Further thoughts: English doesn't have have a word for the opposite of <em>sin</em>, because sin is a religious concept, and mainstream Christianity doesn't have a concept that's the opposite of sin; neither have English speakers found it necessary (<a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2009/08/14/we-are-all-hindus-now.html\">yet?</a> :p) to invent a word for the concept. In a non-religious framework for ethics, of course, there is no such thing as sin either; though certain acts may still be called <em>unethical</em> or <em>wrong</em> or by other terms.</p>\n\n<p>I'm no expert on Christian theology, but it seems that according to that framework, one is born in a state of some sin, and although one can commit further sins (acts against God's commandments), one cannot automatically reduce the effect of those sins simply by performing other good acts. Judaism has a concept of <em>mitzvah</em>, an act that carries out a commandment of God, which may be an opposite of <em>sin</em> in that sense. The concept you may be getting at, prominent in Indian religions (Hindu/Buddhist/Jain/Sikh) comes from a different model, in which there's something like a moral bank balance (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma\"><em>karma</em></a>) in which you can either lose credit through sin (<em>p\u0101pa</em>, acts against some cosmic order of right and wrong) or gain credit/merit through good deeds (<em>pun&#803;ya</em>).</p>\n\n<p>All that is not important, but if by the opposite of <em>sin</em> you're referring to something like the latter concept as informally understood by your audience\u2014with a slight theological connotation as something that brings merit to the doer\u2014then the term <em>pun&#803;ya</em> you were thinking of is precisely the right term to use. Using a generic phrase like \"good deed\" may not convey the intended meaning unless the context is understood (such as in translations etc., where \"good deed\" and \"meritorious act\" are indeed used).</p>\n",
            " <p>The antonym of <strong>sin</strong> is <strong>good deed</strong>. Sin means an action that is against religious rules, so the antonym should be in accordance with religion. </p>\n\n<p>According to many dictionaries <strong>virtue</strong> is the antonym of <strong>vice</strong>. Because it's referring to something moral rather being religious.</p>\n",
            " <p>There is a bit of a theological question here. In my religious tradition, sin is something we do (or fail to do) that brings us guilt before God, but there is nothing we can do that can remove that guilt or restore that relationship. That's why Christ came and died for our sins\u2014to remove that guilt which we could not by our own good works, and to turn away God's wrath. </p>\n",
            " <p>I believe that the word 'sin' has links to archery in the sense of missing the bulls-eye. So, in that sense, hitting the bulls-eye might be the opposite term. Just not sure if the meaning comes across as you intend :-)</p>\n",
            " <p><em>Sin</em> is so completely tied into religious terms and meanings that finding a direct opposite begins to imply much about how you are using the word. Opposites of <em>sin</em> do very much exist but most of them require a specific form of the word:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is a sinful act / This is a holy act</p>\n<p>I am full of sin / I am full of righteousness</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the most direct opposite comes from the old term <em>indulgences</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Catholic theology, an indulgence is the full or partial remission of temporal punishment due for sins which have already been forgiven. (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgences\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Actually <em>using</em> the word in a sentence is a bit of a pain and really won't satisfy a daily opposite of <em>sin</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I committed a sin / I was granted an indulgence</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Part of the problem comes from the source of the act being performed: <em>Humans</em> perform sins; <em>God</em> or the <em>church</em> performs indulgences.</p>\n<p>The next best term would be <em>repentance</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I committed a sin / I performed a repentance</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Likewise with <em>penance</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I committed a sin / I performed penance</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Absolution, protection or recovery from sin is also implied in the religious terms <em>sanctification</em>, <em>justification</em>, <em>baptism</em>, <em>confession</em>, <em>forgiveness</em>, <em>holiness</em>, <em>righteousness</em>. These terms hold their own chapters in Christian theology and to even summarize them here would be futile.</p>\n<p>All of these, however, come at this term from the religious angle. If you simply want an antonym for &quot;bad deed&quot; you will find a similar difficultly in looking for an antonym for &quot;crime.&quot; Any number of phrases will work but a specific word for the opposite of a crime will be hard to find because the concept of a crime doesn't really have an opposite.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I committed a legal act</p>\n<p>I committed a good act</p>\n<p>I committed a virtuous act</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The best I can think of is referring to a character trait as the action itself:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I performed a kindness</p>\n<p>I performed an altruism</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These have mixed success.</p>\n",
            " <p>I agree with Paul though I\u2019d render the word as \u2018perfection\u2019 (bull\u2019s-eye being simply one type of perfection). Sinning in many religious traditions is simply not living up the standard, not getting it right, or falling short.</p>\n",
            " <p>The English word \"sin\" is very much tied up in Christian ideology. In traditional Christian belief human beings are inherently sinful, and can't help but sin continually. As such, there really isn't much need for an opposite because the opposite condition does not (in fact, <em>can not</em>) exist.</p>\n",
            " <p>Sin is primarily a religious concept, which takes various forms. As noted above, certain religious traditions have an antonymous concept (such as mitzvah in judaism), but there is no generally accepted term, because there is no generally accepted concept.</p>\n\n<p>In the judaeo-christian context, perhaps the best approach is to translate mitzvah into English; I understand that the closest translation is \"duty\".</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, this is the wrong question to ask, because English is used by many, many sub-cultures which all have very, very different ideas about this area.</p>\n",
            " <p>In Islam, there is the concept of a \"sin\" and a \"charity.\" At the end of days, your sins and charities are tallied and the math worked out. Generally speaking, a charity is any good dead or deed that brings happiness. Interesting, pleasuring your wife is considered a charity.</p>\n",
            " <p>If we're using the Biblical definition of sin, then sin is transgression of God's law. Many versions translate the Greek as \"Lawlessness\".</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_john/3-4.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bible.cc/1_john/3-4.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the opposite would be \"lawful\".</p>\n\n<p>Interpreted another way, sin can also be said to be disobedience to God's law, so \"Obedience\" is another possible antonym for sin.</p>\n",
            " <p>In religious contexts that I'm aware of you can't \"pay forward\" on sins.  Therefore, any opposite for \"sin\" would have to be considered as a repeal or undoing of that sin.</p>\n\n<p>For \"sin\" used as a <em>noun</em>, some suitable antonyms would be \"<strong><em>atonement</em></strong>\" or \"<strong><em>expiation</em></strong>.\"  The drawbacks of these two terms is that they are often interpreted as acts of personal suffering rather than acts of morally good deeds.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>First I committed a <em>sin</em>,</li>\n<li>Then I made an <em>atonement</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For the <em>verb</em> \"sin\", the verb forms of the aforementioned terms, \"<strong><em>atone</em></strong>\" and \"<strong><em>expiate</em></strong>,\" should be equally suitable.  Another verb that can be used as the undoing of sin is \"<strong><em>redeem</em></strong>,\" as in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"...and don't come back until you've <em>redeemed</em> yourself!\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of course, all of these terms can be used outside of the context of <em>religious sin</em>, so how much \"oppositeness\" they have with \"sin\" would depend on the context in which they're used.</p>\n",
            " <p>Although it comes from a different tradition, I would say \"Dharma\"</p>\n",
            " <p>Abide, I say this because you are following a rule. If there were no rule, then you could not sin. </p>\n\n<p>To abide, comply, follow.</p>\n\n<p>There is no direct antonym e.g. unsin etc. </p>\n",
            " <p>This comes up in Bible translation. \"Righteousness\" is the correct antonym in many contexts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"It is considered a sin\"</li>\n<li>\"It is considered a righteousness\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is a close parallel to the Hebrew \"tzedek\" or \"tzdaka\", with the same root.</p>\n",
            " <p>Sin can be both a verb and a noun. The opposite of the verb sin is <strong>Repent</strong> or <strong>atoned</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>eg.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>First I sinned, then I <strong>repented</strong> so now God loves me - yea!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The opposite of the noun form can be any of the following: good deed, help, redeemed, basically anything that means you did a good thing.</p>\n\n<p>eg.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I made up for that sin by <strong>doing a good deed</strong>, now God owes me one, right?</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
            " <p>My action was without error. </p>\n\n<p>I erred not.</p>\n\n<p>I acted faultlessly.</p>\n\n<p>...and so on, error (okay, existential error) being the essential substance of sin.</p>\n",
            " <p>If you have sinned, then you have done something wrong.  If you have done nothing wrong then you have <strong>behaved</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>conduct oneself in accordance with the accepted norms of a society or\n  group.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you want a Christian twist then I would add <strong>moral</strong>.</p>\n",
            " <p>The Hebrew word <em>mitzvah</em>, which combines \"commandment\" and \"good deed\", is the opposite of sin in that language. There isn't a single word in English with the same nuance.</p>\n",
            " <p>It depends what you mean by <em>sin</em>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are using <em>sin</em> to mean disobedience to one of the Ten Commandments or to 'God's laws', then the opposite must be <strong>obedience to</strong> or <strong>obeying</strong> the Commandments.</p>\n\n<p>If you are using <em>sin</em> to mean 'doing wrong' in general, then it depends how you perceive 'right and wrong'. If you perceive them as 'black and white', i.e. one or the other, then the opposite must be <strong>right</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>But if you perceive 'right and wrong' as two extremes with a whole area in the middle that is neither right nor wrong, then there can be <strong>no exact opposite</strong>. For example, it might be considered wrong (sinful) to hate your neighbour, and right to love you neighbour. But you might actually be indifferent to your neighbour, neither loving nor hating him. In that case, are you sinning; are you doing right or wrong: or are you in the middle?</p>\n",
            " <p>I feel the opposite of Sin is \" Heavenly deed\".  Sinners go to hell and people who does good deeds and obtain \" Punya\" ( Indian opposite word for Sin) will go to Heaven. Good and Ban are are set by each society differently. Some societies view Homosexuality is sin and some view it opposite. How can one define, good or bad, but what ever society or parts of the Country set is decisive factor. Some tribal areas Smoking etc, is natural and legal for them, but not in certain areas. One can not set the exact meanings for Beauty, wind or smell, as how one perceives. Good virtues or deeds is how the particular place or part of the World set the rules and view. Even the above words  Heaven or Hell are also if  one believes</p>\n",
            " <p>The opposite of sin, or to be free from sin, or wrong, is to be blameless, or without sin: </p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://en.academic.ru/dic.nsf/cide/87609/Impeccant\" rel=\"nofollow\">Impeccant</a></strong> a. Sinless; impeccable. --Byron. [1913 Webster]  </p>\n\n<p>Notably, sin is a religious and not a secular, and the concept is based on being in full communion with God.  The action of doing good deeds does not make one without sin, not addresses the communion itself.  Perhaps this contradiction is best understood in the example of a mobster who kills without impunity but yet is adored for their generosity within their community</p>\n"

        "sft_target": " <p>English does not have a precise word for the opposite of <em>sin</em> in the sense you mean, so you'll have to be content with adjectives: the opposite of \"I committed a sin\" would be \"I performed a good/virtuous/righteous/moral/meritorious &nbsp;act/deed\". (Note that the noun forms of these adjectives won't work: <em>goodness</em> has a very wide range of meanings; <em>virtue</em> refers to qualities inhering in a person and carries no connotation of action unlike <em>virtuous act</em> which does, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>As you're writing for an Indian audience, the word you have in mind that's already familiar to your audience (<em>pun&#803;ya</em>) is a perfectly good choice to use. The criterion should not be whether a certain word exists in an English dictionary or not, but whether your audience will understand the word or not.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Further thoughts: English doesn't have have a word for the opposite of <em>sin</em>, because sin is a religious concept, and mainstream Christianity doesn't have a concept that's the opposite of sin; neither have English speakers found it necessary (<a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2009/08/14/we-are-all-hindus-now.html\">yet?</a> :p) to invent a word for the concept. In a non-religious framework for ethics, of course, there is no such thing as sin either; though certain acts may still be called <em>unethical</em> or <em>wrong</em> or by other terms.</p>\n\n<p>I'm no expert on Christian theology, but it seems that according to that framework, one is born in a state of some sin, and although one can commit further sins (acts against God's commandments), one cannot automatically reduce the effect of those sins simply by performing other good acts. Judaism has a concept of <em>mitzvah</em>, an act that carries out a commandment of God, which may be an opposite of <em>sin</em> in that sense. The concept you may be getting at, prominent in Indian religions (Hindu/Buddhist/Jain/Sikh) comes from a different model, in which there's something like a moral bank balance (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma\"><em>karma</em></a>) in which you can either lose credit through sin (<em>p\u0101pa</em>, acts against some cosmic order of right and wrong) or gain credit/merit through good deeds (<em>pun&#803;ya</em>).</p>\n\n<p>All that is not important, but if by the opposite of <em>sin</em> you're referring to something like the latter concept as informally understood by your audience\u2014with a slight theological connotation as something that brings merit to the doer\u2014then the term <em>pun&#803;ya</em> you were thinking of is precisely the right term to use.

            " <p>Although \"Our cost proposed is expensive.\" is not grammatically incorrect, it is a bit hard to follow and might not be what you are really trying to say. In the sentence \"Our proposed cost is expensive.\" the topic is \"Our proposed cost\", where in \"Our cost proposed is expensive.\" it is only \"Our cost\". Sentence 1 is straight forward, where sentence 2 eludes to evasiveness. The listener might interpret it as \"Our cost[, as it is currently proposed,] is expensive.\" and wonder why the unsurety.

But in reality, you can see that it is ostensibly verbal because e.g. it can be made progressive and/or have an agent introduced:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The cost [being proposed (by them)] is too high.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, you could also use 'proposed' as a simple adjective before the noun. Notice in that case that it cannot be made progressive or have an agent introduced in English:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The proposed cost is too high.</p>\n<p>*The being proposed cost is too high.</p>\n<p>*The proposed by them cost is too high.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
            " <p>Both are acceptable. \nEx: The money earned was less than the money paid.\nThe decorated room looks nice. \nMoney earned= money that was earned ( reduced adjective)</p>\n",
            " <p>Sometimes it is necessary to put past participle as an adjective after the noun.\nFor example: <em>The wars and political developments</em> (that had been) <em>occurred/ taken place in Indian history is not a concern of my research.</em> </p>\n",
            " <p>\"The cost proposed is...\" is fine. \"Our cost proposed is...\" is awkward. This is because \"The cost proposed is...\" is the same as saying \"The cost (which was) proposed is...\" but you would not say \"Our cost (which was) proposed...\"</p>\n",
            " <p>This is a rather difficult point. I once heard a rule along the lines of 'states precede, definitions follow', meaning that if you want to use a past participle to describe, it goes before the noun but if you want to use it to define the noun it must follow. Thus 'The concerned people' means something different from 'The people concerned'. it is not always possible to put the participle before the noun. so you can say a lost dog but not a found dog.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>In a documentary film on the Russian Revolution the narrator used the phrase \"within a generation\", and I'm not exactly sure what it means.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Socialism promised peace, prosperity, and equality for all peoples of the world. But the social experiment failed. Millions were killed, and <strong><em>within a generation</em></strong> almost one third of the world's population was living in the shadow of communism.<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wanted to check a few figures about how many people lived under communism, but the phrase \"within a generation\" left me wondering at what period I should be checking populations figures. Generally I've had the habit of considering roughly 20 years for a generation. In some dictionaries and other sources it says a generation for humans is about 30 years. It also mentions this on Wikipedia.<br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>generation<br>\n  2.the term of years, about 30 among human beings, accepted as the average period between the birth of parents and the birth of their offspring.<br>\n  <a href=\"https://www.thefreedictionary.com/generation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Random House Kernerman Webster's College Dictionary</a> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Anyway, in terms of that particular use of \"generation\", couldn't \"within a generation\" mean something closer to a person's average lifetime, say, 50, 60 or 70 years? The reason I'm wondering this is because, for example, say a group of people are born in 1960. Couldn't you say the 9/11 terrorist attack occurred within those people's generation? Even if they were 41 years old at the time it happened, and also notwithstanding that by that time another younger generation had been born? </p>\n\n<p>Is that a reasonable use of \"within someone's generation\"?</p>\n\n<p>Even if we take 30 years to mean a generation, the narrator's statement would mean that by about 1947 nearly a third of the world's population lived under communism. This just doesn't seem right. In 1947 the world's population was about 2.5 billion. One third of that is about 830 million. But we can't even include China (roughly with a population of 500 million), because it didn't become communist until 1949. Similarly the British Empire and/or India (it doesn't matter because independent India was never communist anyway) had a population of over 500 million, and when you consider the other most populous countries that were never communist this figure of \"almost one third\" really doesn't sound right. That is, of course, unless \"within a generation\" can be understood to mean what I mentioned earlier, roughly a group of people's lifetime, meaning it can extend to 40, 50, or 60 years. In that case I can imagine China's population explosion, along with other communist revolutions just maybe might bring it to the \"nearly one third\" measure used in the film. </p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: <p>The words <em>next-door neighbour</em> and <em>postdoc</em> are nearly always said without a 't'. The Oxford Dictionary online gives the transcription as /p\u0259\u028as(t)\u02c8d\u0252k/, and the audio clearly says the word without a /t/ sound. You can <a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/postdoc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">listen here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Where does this /t/ go to and why is it allowed to disappear? I looked at the top-rated answer answer to this question here: <a href=\"https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/196668/why-is-cupboard-pronounced-with-a-silent-p\">Why is &quot;cupboard&quot; pronounced with a silent &quot;p&quot;?</a> </p>\n\n<p>That answer states that it is because the 't' and the 'd' in <em>pos<b>td</b>oc</em> and <em>nex<b>t-d</b>oor neighbour</em> are the same apart from that <em>t</em> is voiceless and <em>d</em> isn't. When two consonants are made in the same way in the same part of the mouth like this, then one of them can disappear. That's what it says. But, I double checked with some other English Language scholars and they say that this isn't true at all. </p>\n\n<p>They point out lots of examples where the 't' usually disappears but the next consonant isn't a /d/, isn't made in the same place, and isn't the same type of consonant. For example <em>guest book</em> is normally pronounced <em>guess book</em>. Here are some more:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>postman</li>\n<li>mostly</li>\n<li>left me</li>\n<li>left-field</li>\n<li>kept calm</li>\n<li>disruptment</li>\n<li>abruptly</li>\n<li>mustn't</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>They also pointed out the following where we get a /dt/ or /td/ sequence, but neither the /d/ nor the /t/ can be missed out. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>bedtime [*bed ime]</li>\n<li>head teacher [*head eacher]</li>\n<li>feet don't hurt [*fee don't hurt]</li>\n<li>meltdown  [*meldown]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What's going on? Is there a phonological rule here? And where have all those /t/s gone?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>Neat observation. Here is a rule that works for American pronunciation only; I don't know how this works in other dialects:</p>\n\n<p>(Usual in American:) Syllable-final /t/ is replaced by glottal stop before a consonant or a pause. </p>\n\n<p>(Your observation:) This glottal stop is then further reduced to zero when preceded by a voiceless consonant. </p>\n\n<p>Note that in all your counterexamples, the proceeding sound to the glottal stop is either a vowel or a voiced consonant.</p>\n",
            " <p><strong>My first explanation</strong>:<br>\nIt's called elision or cluster simplification and is common in many languages other than English. In all of the examples two consecutive stop gestures (where the oral airway is completely blocked) are simplified to one, making pronunciation easier. Elision tends to be <em>regressive</em> (i.e., the gesture that is omitted is the first one).</p>\n\n<p><strong>My second explanation (which contradicts the first, but conveniently explains the counterexamples)</strong>:<br>\nThe gestures making up /t/ can be reduced when anywhere outside of foot-initial position (see Harris' paper \"<a href=\"http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/johnh/papers/labphon.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Release the captive coda</a>\" for a similar but better-thought out statement). The form of the reduction will depend on the phonetic context. The first explanation is confused and totally wrong because the effect doesn't occur across foot boundaries, so there is no regressive assimilation. </p>\n\n<p>In word-final position, AE stops can be unreleased. /t/ and /d/ are the only stops that can be second in a stop cluster, so they will often go unnoticed when part of a word-final stop cluster (though your tongue tip may still go up).\nWhen /t/ forms a cluster with fricatives /s/, /S/, or /f/, the /t/ is often unreleased, or omitted altogether. I'd wager there's an aerodynamic explanation for this: intraoral air pressure is bled off in producing the fricative, so there's not as much left for the plosive burst. Other things being equal, /t/ (when fully pronounced) should be weaker in a word-final cluster with a fricative than when by itself. When forming a cluster with a sonorant (nasal or liquid), /t/ will often be realized as glottalization and go unreleased. (say <em>melt</em> and <em>can't</em> to yourself and see). Of course, when foot-internal in a disyllabic word like <em>water</em>, /t/ is tapped and no longer a plosive.</p>\n",

Therefore to translate to English <strong>and keep to the same register</strong>, you must select the more pedestrian <em>next-to-last</em>.

Because of the Norman occupation, Modern English often has pairs of words <em>in different and contrasting registers</em>, where a more purely Romance or purely Germanic language than English now is would have only one. </p>\n\n<p>This gives English more flexibility and nuance by having recourse to a pair of terms instead of having one alone.

            " <p>First, I kindly recommend you to read this quote from \"Gertrude Stein\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And what does a comma do, a comma does nothing but make easy a thing that if you like it enough is easy enough without the comma. A long complicated sentence should force itself upon you, make you know yourself knowing it and the comma, well at the most a comma is a poor period that lets you stop and take a breath but if you want to take a breath you ought to know yourself that you want to take a breath. It is not like stopping altogether has something to do with going on, but taking a breath well you are always taking a breath and why emphasize one breath rather than another breath. Anyway that is the way I felt about it and I felt that about it very very strongly. And so I almost never used a comma. The longer, the more complicated the sentence the greater the number of the same kinds of words I had following one after another, the more the very more I had of them the more I felt the passionate need of their taking care of themselves by themselves and not helping them, and thereby enfeebling them by putting in a comma.\n  So that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose, in poetry it is a little different but more so \u2026</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And as Mike said, the second one sounds correct. like \"a comma + a little conjunction \".</p>\n",
            " <p>I agree with Boob's rationale for #2, but I might also suggest rewording the sentence to something more like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Although both are based on librsync, they behave quite differently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In which case, you only need one comma.</p>\n",
            " <p>If you want to keep that structure, I would go with #2, but use <code>beyond</code> instead:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Both are based on librsync, but beyond that, they behave quite differently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
            " <p>In one school of thought, the first and third sentences are correct but not the second. We refer to Larry Trask's <a href=\"http://www.informatics.sussex.ac.uk/department/docs/punctuation/node14.html#SECTION00045000000000000000.\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Guide to Punctuation</em></a> to substantiate this claim.</p>\n\n<p>In the second sentence, the second comma is a mistake (it is not a listing/joining/gapping/bracketing comma). The last two commas in the third sentence are an optional pair of bracketing commas to set off the weak interruption <em>above that</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the joining commas before <em>but</em> in the first and third sentences are optional.</p>\n",

I prefer my first version to the other two.  My second example, without any commas, is extreme in its (lack of) punctuation, but is probably tenable.  With 'beyond' instead of 'above', options 1 and 3 in the question are OK.  My third option uses 'above', but the extra context added by 'layers' makes it sensible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Both are based on librsync but, beyond that, they behave quite differently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this punctuation is also tenable (if you have any comma around 'beyond that' - or 'above that' in the original - then you need the pair since it is a parenthetical comment in the sentence and the pair of commas makes that clear).  If you dropped the comma-enclosed phrase, you would not <em>need</em> any punctuation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Both are based on librsync but they behave quite differently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You could add a comma before 'but', and in times past that would have been added automatically.</p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I've been quoting <em>Lolita</em> (as well as <em>Don Juan</em>, <em>Man and Superman</em>, <em>Pygmalion</em>, <em>Tom Jones</em>, and various Mark Twain's witticisms) for a while now; some people might be annoyed by this, but I don't care anymore, for reasons that should be obvious to some people here):</p>\n\n<p>From <em>Lolita</em> by Vladimir Nabokov:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>She sat right in the focus of my incandescent anger. The fog of all lust had been swept away leaving nothing but this dreadful lucidity. Oh, she had changed! Her complexion was now that of any vulgar untidy highschool girl who applies shared cosmetics with grubby fingers to an unwashed face and does not mind what soiled texture, what pustulate epidermis comes in contact with her skin. Its smooth tender bloom had been so lovely in former days, so bright with tears, when I used to roll, in play, her tousled head on my knee. A coarse flush had now replaced that innocent fluorescence. What was locally known as a <strong>\"rabbit cold</strong>\" had painted with flaming pink the edges of her contemptuous nostrils. As in terror I lowered my gaze, it mechanically slid along the underside of her tensely stretched bare thigh\u2014how polished and muscular her legs had grown! </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The way it's dashingly described, the condition is instantly recognizable in the sentence (let's give the author that, he is an artist, not just a linguist). </p>\n\n<p>But. Is there a more common term for it?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NiAHZ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NiAHZ.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong></p>\n\n<p>\"Locally known\" would mean New England, or, to be more precise, Massachusetts, where the novel's \"Beardsley School for Girls\" is located, according to some reputable sources, including, but not limited to, the fellow who authored <em>The Annotated Lolita</em> (a volume that includes the novel's text and an index and comments whose length exceeds that of the novel).</p>\n\n<p>A bright gal published an essay on the web in which she claimed she had definitely gone to the school that is described in the novel.

The Russian translation of the same novel (penned by Nabokov himself) has it as \"\u043a\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u044c\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0430\", which, I'm told, is the exact same thing, and a quick google search on it turns up the exact same useless slew of references to sick rabbits and various methods of treating them as the original. </p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

When hovering over the waypoint the screen read \"ASSASSINATION.\" We completed the mission fine, but the icon was not on my map.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: I realize that not all icons show up when you are zoomed out on the map screen...I'm not that stupid but I know someone will tell me to zoom in...</p>\n\n<p>I was wondering if anyone else has this issue where some quests/missions appear just fine while others have no icon on the map, making them impossible to find unless you try and hover over every inch of the map.</p>\n\n<p>Im not sure if this is relevant but I'm playing on PC.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: <p>For most of the 3rd and 4th seasons, I sat just bellow Silver (900 - 1300 SR). Of course I think I should be higher, but that's a fair place for me to be, and I enjoy playing at that level.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last few nights I had a very long loss streak and am now around 700 SR. At this level I've had multiple games where Mercys refuse to heal and just shoot, you can win a game with 6 attack heros, and people are so toxic that I often remove myself from voice chat. I play tanks and healers, and so I enjoy the game most when my team is playing together. Right now, my enjoyment of the game is shot.</p>\n\n<p>I'm worried that I now have a terribly low MMR and will continue to place at this level next season.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question: Given the way the SR / MMR system works, what things can I do to increase my chances of placing higher next season?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Like, for example, would it help if I stuck to Quick Play for a while to up my MMR before doing the Season 5 Qualifying Matches? Should I create a new account to get a clean MMR?</p>\n\n<p>I'm aware that long term, I should probably go to Looking-For-Group sites and find a community, but at the moment \"700 SR healer/tank\" won't get any clicks.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Note that I am <strong>not</strong> looking for gameplay tips, I'm specifically asking about \"resetting\" my SR / MMR.</em></p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

The only way to truly reset your MMR is to buy the game again on a new account, which will set your MMR to be whatever the average rank is. </p>\n\n<p>However, I strongly advise against doing this. If you dropped down to 700 SR, chances are you probably belong somewhere around that level, plus or minus a couple hundred SR. (Not trying to be rude, just stating how the system is supposed to work.) It might be tough, but if your actual skill level is higher than that, you should eventually climb out on your own. Buying a new account risks you paying extra money just to go through the exact same frustration when you drop lower again. </p>\n\n<p>At the start of every new season, there is a soft-reset of all player's ranks (normalized to the average player rank, which I think is somewhere in silver or gold). I don't know if this also affects MMR, but it should give you a chance to place higher than you might have gotten in the previous season. </p>\n\n<p>Loss streaks happen, and the matchmaking system realizes this. Chances are your MMR is probably not all that heavily affected. You're probably still playing with people of a similar skill level as before, but because your visible rank is lower, you focus more on how \"bad\" your teammates are <em>now</em> as opposed to how they played before the loss streak. </p>\n\n<p>Even if your MMR is lower now... that's how it's supposed to work. The matchmaking system tries to even everyone out to an approximately 50% win/loss ratio. Trying to get around this system is just asking for frustration. </p>\n",
            " <p>Your best option is to <strong>find some players who are also stuck in the bottom ranks, and group up with them</strong>.  Find people with mics so you can coordinate your attacks/defense over Discord or in-game voice chat.  Even if they are not very good, having consistent teammates and even a small amount of coordination should easily get you all back into the 1000's.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Why is having a group so important? In Overwatch <em>(and many other team-based games)</em>, the ranks at the bottom 1%(-ish) are known as <em>MMR Hell</em> - the skills of players varies so wildly, you're just as likely to get a troll teammate who's trying to lose, or a 5-year-old mashing on the controller, as you are a decent teammate.</p>\n\n<p>People claim \"over enough games it will even out\", but they're forgetting that people often group up, which screws up the balance.  Eg. if there's a group of 5 and you're solo-queueing, you have a 1/7 chance of being on their team, and 6/7 chance of being against them.  And given that they're likely not deliberately grouping with trolls/5-year-olds, you have a much higher chance of losing.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, getting out of the lowest ranks by yourself takes significantly more effort than at higher ranks, no matter how good you are <em>(and unlike many other team-games, in Overwatch even the best players can't carry an entire team by themselves)</em>.  Because of this, \"playing a lot of games\" is not a good option.  You will eventually get out of MMR Hell, but depending on your luck it could take a <em>long</em> time.</p>\n",

Revan is kept in some kind of suspended animation state while the Emperor pries into his mind, but vows to not only stay strong and not reveal information about the Republic, but also to enhance the Emperor's naturally cautious tendencies, thus delaying the Sith Invasion long enough for his children to grow up in a galaxy without war. This delaying action is presumably what led to the 300-year gap between the events of <em>KOTOR</em> / <em>Revan</em> and those of <em>The Old Republic</em>. Revan's eventual fate, however, is unknown, and likely to be a significant plot point in <em>The Old Republic</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>While playing some normal draft, it seems that the flavor of the month is to invade the enemies jungle. Depending on the team composition, we'll win, or we'll lose...but that makes me wonder: What really makes a team at lvl 1 strong? Are there champions that do ridiculous damage early that would blow up another team? Do you have to have a stun to invade?</p>\n\n<p>If you were setting up an early team, what would you do to make sure you secure the opposing teams jungle?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>Several major factors play a big role in level 1 fights.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The base statistics of the champion</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Since at level one, the tanks hasn't had a chance to build any armor, magic resist, or health yet, or the carries hasn't had a chance to build any damage items yet, everything hinges on what base stats champions are given.</p>\n\n<p>When looking at the base stats, it is also important to pay attention specifically to the starting stat plus the stat gained per level. Let's look at Gangplank for example. Gangplank is generally considered a pretty squishy champion unless he builds health and armor/magic resist. He is one of those champions that people build as a glass cannon sometimes, someone who does a lot of damage but dies easily. However lets look at his base stat. He starts out with 495 + 81/level. That's a starting health of 576 plus any health that his starting item might have given him. That's quite a lot for someone who is considered a relatively squishy champion.</p>\n\n<p>Now lets look at a champion that is normally considered tanky. Lets look at Udyr. Udyr's health is 427 + 99/level so he starts with 526. That is 50 less health! But Udyr has much higher health gained per level than Gangplank does. This means Gangplank has a stronger earlier game(in terms of health). You can take this thought process and apply it to the armor and magic resist  and other statistics.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Skills and Passives optimized for level 1</strong></p>\n\n<p>This should be a philosophy that should apply to late game too but it is especially important early game because each of your teammates will only have on skill available to them instead of all 4. Choose a team that is balanced. You need a good balance of crowd control plus damage. A team that focuses too much on damage but has no crowd control will not be able to focus down on a single target enough to kill them. With the use of a snare or a stun, it provides a definite bull eyes sign for all your teammates to focus, usually screwing up their team formation and it will also prevent the enemy from getting away from the damage by preventing them from flashing away and making them become easier targets for skillshots.</p>\n\n<p>Damage:</p>\n\n<p>Generally casters are a lot weaker at level 1 because they are limited to one skill and their base attack damage and attack speed are very low! This will lower the amount of damage they can deal. </p>\n\n<p>When choosing a strong early game damage dealer, take a look at their base attack damage and their skills. A champion like Ganglank, has a strong early game because he has multiple sources of damage. His auto attacks can proc his passive that can not only deal additional damage but provide a slow, AND his Parrrley which has a relatively low cooldown can add a lot of additional damage.</p>\n\n<p>Crowd Control:</p>\n\n<p>Generally a team that is able to stop a enemy from running away or actually brings the enemy to the team will have the upper hand in team fights. Morgana's Dark Binding starts out with a 2 second snare. That is quite a bit of time to stand still. Blitz who takes his grab at level 1 will literally serve one of the enemies on a platter if one of them is pulled into your team.</p>\n\n<p>Passives:</p>\n\n<p>Not only do we have to look at the skills a champions have but also their passives. Some champions passives will be way more useful in level 1 fights than others. For example, Volibears passive will let him regenerate 30% of his health back when he reaches a certain threshold on his health bar. Or Anivia who turns into an egg when her health bar reaches 0. Contrast that to Ryze who gets a 1 second cool down reduction for each spell he casts. But that reduction can't be utilized at all since he can only use one skill at a time. Or Ahri who gains life steal for one attack after hitting 9 targets. This is great in all for sustain but during the course of a team fight, the passive will not really play a big factor.</p>\n\n<p>Non-target skillshots:</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes in a level 1 fight, you get to an impasse where neither teams are willing to iniate and are just standing just out of range. Having a champion with a long non-target skillshot harass will generally mean an easier team fight OR allow you to push them back if you are indeed trying to invade their jungle. These skills include Nidalee's spears, Lux's Lucent Singularity(which not only damages but also provide vision for 5 seconds if she does not detonate), and Ezreal's Mystic shot. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Vision</strong></p>\n\n<p>If there is a support on your team, ask them to take Clairvoyance and to buy wards(technically, you shouldn't need to ask them if they are playing support). Vision is very important especially in early games because a champion can be focus down very fast if you can see them. If you are invading their blue, or if your blue is being invade, throw a ward onto the bush right next to where the golem spawns. Once the team fight starts, the support should throw the Clairvoyance right behind where the enemy is so provide vision of all of them. Vision in the jungle is very limited because, the bushes and the corners in the jungle will inhibit vision.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Initiation and Team Formation</strong></p>\n\n<p>Because in level 1 fights the tanks have not begun building tanky items yet, there really isn't a tank per se. Anyone who runs into the fray can easily be focused down in seconds. Because of this, it is better to stay in formation (champions with higher defensive base stats in the front, and champions with lower defensive base stats in the back), and play reactively. If one of them charges in, then focus that champion down. Generally it is smart to have your \"formation\" near a bush so the squishy targets can utilize that to avoid being a initial target in the fight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Items</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since Champions start out with 475 gold or 515 gold(if you put the two points in the ultility tree), items do not play as big of a factor. However generally buying Dorian items will give you more bang for your limited buck and give you an early game advantage.</p>\n",
            " <p>When invading, it's important to maximize <a href=\"http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Crowd_control\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Crowd Control</a> (CC) and damage.  Select runes and masteries that give full benefit at first lvl (no scaling!), and start with either boots or a doran's blade/ring.  </p>\n\n<p>The goal is to have your entire team hiding in a bush and to then isolate one enemy and 5v1 them.  Use any CC you have to stop them from retreating and grab a quick kill.</p>\n\n<p>Some summoner spells have an advantage when invading:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Exhaust: lowers movement and possibly armor/mr</li>\n<li>Ignite: helps to secure a kill, possibly adds ad/ap</li>\n<li>Ghost/Flash: useful for chasing or escaping</li>\n<li>Heal: Can heal bait (tempt enemy into overextending based on low hp, then heal)</li>\n<li>Clairvoyance: useful for finding the enemy champions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For a champion to excel at invading, they need some form of CC at lvl 1 + the damage or HP to survive the encounter.

            " <p>A lvl 1 invade tends to just be that you might see one person caught by themselves or facechecking a brush that your whole team is.

Will completely destroy a lvl 1 teamfight and let your team ace them if a 5v5 engage happens.<br>\n<strong>Janna</strong> - She has a AoE knockup with Howling Gale.  More used to disengage a teamfight, but can give enough delay to allow your team to pick someone off.  Also has the team movement speed passive<br>\n<strong>Annie</strong> - She can charge up her incinerate to stun, giving her another AoE hard CC.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR - If you have AoE and CC at lvl 1 more than your enemy, you can try to invade and counterjungle as a team early to give yourself an early advantage.</p>\n"

Morgana's Dark Binding starts out with a 2 second snare. That is quite a bit of time to stand still. Blitz who takes his grab at level 1 will literally serve one of the enemies on a platter if one of them is pulled into your team.</p>\n\n<p>Passives:</p>\n\n<p>Not only do we have to look at the skills a champions have but also their passives. Some champions passives will be way more useful in level 1 fights than others. For example, Volibears passive will let him regenerate 30% of his health back when he reaches a certain threshold on his health bar. Or Anivia who turns into an egg when her health bar reaches 0. Contrast that to Ryze who gets a 1 second cool down reduction for each spell he casts. But that reduction can't be utilized at all since he can only use one skill at a time. Or Ahri who gains life steal for one attack after hitting 9 targets. This is great in all for sustain but during the course of a team fight, the passive will not really play a big factor.</p>\n\n<p>Non-target skillshots:</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes in a level 1 fight, you get to an impasse where neither teams are willing to iniate and are just standing just out of range. Having a champion with a long non-target skillshot harass will generally mean an easier team fight OR allow you to push them back if you are indeed trying to invade their jungle. These skills include Nidalee's spears, Lux's Lucent Singularity(which not only damages but also provide vision for 5 seconds if she does not detonate), and Ezreal's Mystic shot. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Vision</strong></p>\n\n<p>If there is a support on your team, ask them to take Clairvoyance and to buy wards(technically, you shouldn't need to ask them if they are playing support). Vision is very important especially in early games because a champion can be focus down very fast if you can see them. If you are invading their blue, or if your blue is being invade, throw a ward onto the bush right next to where the golem spawns. Once the team fight starts, the support should throw the Clairvoyance right behind where the enemy is so provide vision of all of them. Vision in the jungle is very limited because, the bushes and the corners in the jungle will inhibit vision.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Initiation and Team Formation</strong></p>\n\n<p>Because in level 1 fights the tanks have not begun building tanky items yet, there really isn't a tank per se. Anyone who runs into the fray can easily be focused down in seconds. Because of this, it is better to stay in formation (champions with higher defensive base stats in the front, and champions with lower defensive base stats in the back), and play reactively. If one of them charges in, then focus that champion down. Generally it is smart to have your \"formation\" near a bush so the squishy targets can utilize that to avoid being a initial target in the fight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Items</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since Champions start out with 475 gold or 515 gold(if you put the two points in the ultility tree), items do not play as big of a factor. However generally buying Dorian items will give you more bang for your limited buck and give you an early game advantage.</p>\n",
        "rejected_target": " <p>A lvl 1 invade tends to just be that you might see one person caught by themselves or facechecking a brush that your whole team is.  But what should logically help your team decide to invade or not is primarily the AoE damage potential and CC potential.  If you have either of these more than the other team, then you know you are the stronger lvl 1 team.</p>\n\n<p>Strong lvl 1 champs:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alistar</strong> - He has a AoE hard CC with his pulverize.  Will completely destroy a lvl 1 teamfight and let your team ace them if a 5v5 engage happens.<br>\n<strong>Janna</strong> - She has a AoE knockup with Howling Gale.  More used to disengage a teamfight, but can give enough delay to allow your team to pick someone off.  Also has the team movement speed passive<br>\n<strong>Annie</strong> - She can charge up her incinerate to stun, giving her another AoE hard CC.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR - If you have AoE and CC at lvl 1 more than your enemy, you can try to invade and counterjungle as a team early to give yourself an early advantage.</p>\n"

Since this proof is not constructive, it may not be the algorithmic sort of method you're looking for.</p>\n",
            " <p>Since the nature of the question seems to blend computing and physics, one way to look into it is from the perspective of the former. Not sure if the following quite makes sense, but I think it is worthwhile to see where this way of thinking leads to.</p>\n<p>It is certainly possible to have a recursively enumerable procedure for the purpose, something that would propose a Lagrangian given a description of a physical situation (which would then be tested against an experiment, and accepted or rejected accordingly). Here, we only assume that a given physical situation (problem) can be encoded with a computable function (to define the input for the above). Note that it does not matter whether this function itself is correct or not.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, this is utterly a theoretical construct and not useful in any way in practice.</p>\n<p>But, let us try to translate the entire idea into the computing domain and suppose that there is an algorithm (Turing machine) that can spit out a <em>correct</em> Lagrangian for the given physical situation. Call this machine A. (That this is unlikely to be possible is indicated by the fact that even a seemingly simpler problem of whether a Hamiltonian is gapped or gapless is in general undecidable. (There are some technical assumptions that go with this, of course.)) In the absence of a physical experiment, we need to define <em>correct</em>. By that, we mean that when a given physical situation (experiment) is encoded into a Turing machine (which always can be done), call it X, we can certify that the output Lagrangian from A is equivalent to the one encoded in the Turing machine X. But, then, we would be able to test a non-trivial property of an arbitrary Turing machine (because X can be arbitrary), which is impossible. (That's a standard argument from computer science.)</p>\n<p>Obviously, this is plausible (or, something along those lines if there is an error in the argument above) to the extent that one believes that every physical function (experiment, thought of as a function from preparation/input to outcomes/output) is computable, in the spirit of Church-Turing thesis. Note that any assumption of quantumness or (ontic) randomness in the description of X plays no role in the validity (or falsehood, for that matter) of the argument, because, as is well known, we can still simulate those processes using conventional (classical) algorithms.</p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p>$\\newcommand{\\ket}[1]{\\left|#1\\right&gt;}$</p>\n\n<p>I am learning about exact diagonalization methods, currently following <a href=\"http://physics.bu.edu/~sandvik/vietri/dia.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this explanation</a>. My question is in regards to the part where we utilize the fact that the Hamiltonian conserves the total spin to block-diagonalize it. In this explanation it says that \"block-diagonalization just amounts to including states with only given $m_z$,\" and the process is to simply compute individual blocks with different total magnetization. </p>\n\n<p>My question is, how is this different than simply rearranging the order of the states? If I initially construct the Hamiltonian in the \"binary basis\", where $\\ket{0} \\equiv \\ket{\\cdots 0000} \\equiv \\ket{\\cdots \\downarrow\\downarrow\\downarrow\\downarrow}, \\ldots, \\ket{5} \\equiv \\ket{\\cdots 0101} \\equiv \\ket{\\cdots \\downarrow \\uparrow \\downarrow\\uparrow}$, etc, then I want to reorder the basis such that the states are grouped by their total spin $m_z$, and I do this by permuting the rows and columns of the Hamiltonian which I obtained in the binary basis. </p>\n\n<p>For example, for $N=4$, the states $\\ket{3}\\equiv \\ket{0011}$ and $\\ket{5}\\equiv \\ket{0101}$ both have $m_z = 2$, while $\\ket{4} \\equiv \\ket{0100}$ has $m_z = 1$. So I swap rows 3 and 4 and then columns 3 and 4, which I thought would just correspond to reordering the basis states as $\\left\\{\\ket{0},\\ket{1} ,\\ket{2}, \\ket{4},\\ket{3},\\ket{5},\\ldots\\right\\}$. It seems to me that if I reorder the states such that all those with the same $m_z$ are adjacent then the resulting matrix should be block diagonal.</p>\n\n<p>I have written a code to swap rows and columns of the Hamiltonian such that they are ordered from maximum $m_z$ to minimum $m_z$, but the resulting matrix is not block diagonal.

            " <p>If you hold a weight in place, your physical effort does not produce physics work. The energy expended is internal. Richard Feynman in his physics lectures explains it this way:</p>\n<p><em>The fact that we have to generate effort to hold up a weight is simply due to to the design of striated muscle. What happens is when a nerve impulse reaches a muscle fiber, the fiber gives a little twitch and then relaxes, so that when we hold something up , enormous volleys of nerve impulses are coming in to the muscle, large numbers of twitches are maintaining the weight, while other fibers relax. When we hold a heavy weight we get tired, begin to shake, ...because the muscle is tired and not reacting fast enough.</em></p>\n<p>When you are simply holding the weight, you do no physics work. But you expend chemical potential energy of your body when your muscle fibers alternatively &quot;twitch and relax&quot; as described by Feynman. Think of it as internal physiological work as opposed to external physics work. If you lift the weight (even at constant velocity) you are doing positive work separating the dumbbell from the earth resulting in the Earth-dumbbell system gaining gravitational potential energy. Some of your chemical potential energy will still be converted to thermal energy simply because your body is not 100% efficient performing the work.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>\n",

Because the system is in equilibrium the amount of work done by table on mass is same as amount of work done by mass on the table so no work on average is being down.

Have your mass be connected to bunch of strings. If you would hang the mass on the strings,  nothing moves and no work is being down to keep the mass in air. This is analogical to holding the mass exactly in line of your bones. Notice, that holding your body in straight position is quite easy, while holding it on bended legs is difficult (the similar situation happens while holding heavy bag with relaxed arm so that you are supporting it with your bones instead of muscles). In fact, if you would be perfectly straight and all you mass is distributed in such a way that it is completely supported by your bones, you would never get tired.</p>\n<p>The situation when you bend your legs is similar to raising the mass little higher (so that it is no longer supported by strings - the strings get relaxed) and letting it go. Of course, naturally it would fall down, the strings stretch and start supporting the mass. But you do not want to do this. You want the mass to be kept higher in the air, and you will start pulling randomly on the strings attached to the mass, giving the mass upward impulses. But as you pull, you immediately relax, so only little amount of upward impulse gets transferred to the mass and it starts falling again.

Immediately we can think of systems confined to a plane where <span class=\"math-container\">$L_z$</span> isn't conserved (e.g. angular momentum of spring on a watch or that of a plane disk rolling down an incline).

This is correct.</p>\n\n<p>If dark matter is indeed some as-yet unknown particle, it would be surprising if it was the <em>only</em> unknown particle. The standard model of particle physics is basically complete, without room for extra particles without changing some of the underlying principles. There are some anomalies which point to our knowledge of particle physics being incomplete, so eventually discoveries will likely be made. Anyway, all this is to say that there are probably many species of dark particles, but it is currently thought (mostly by invocation of Occam's razor) that the 'astrophysical dark matter', the stuff that explains the motions within and between galaxies, is either predominantly due to one particle, or a family of particles which behave similarly as far as the relevant astrophysics is concerned.</p>\n\n<p>Now I hesitate to make this next point in this way, but I think there is some merit to the statement that dark matter isn't \"the same\" on all scales. The standard cold dark matter has been hugely successful in explaining the physics of the large scale Universe, but fails in some areas on small scales. There are other examples of ideas to explain astrophysical dark matter which work very well on small scales but struggle on large scales. One example is the modified gravity theory MOND. I bring up this particular theory only because there is a nice, reasonably accessible article contrasting it and LCDM available here: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7525\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7525</a></p>\n\n<p>As yet no one theory has succeeded in explaining the dark matter effect on all scales, which is why we still have an astrophysical dark matter problem, in addition to the question of what particle dark matter might be. </p>\n\n<p>So I agree with some interpretation of (the spirit of?) the statement, but I don't think it was especially well articulated in the article cited in the question. </p>\n",

            " <p>Beta radiation has a smaller penetration depth than gamma radiation. In the thinner parts of your body (like your hands), gamma radiation will go straight through, continuing out the other side. Most of the energy of the gamma rays will not be deposited. Beta radiation on the other hand will be stopped in your body. When the radiation is stopped, all of its energy is deposited inside you. The amount of energy deposited is what makes radiation dangerous. The energy will ionize electrons from the orbitals of atoms, breaking chemical bonds that should be there and forming chemical bonds that shouldn't be there.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/m8N2q.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/m8N2q.png\" alt=\"Relative penetration depths of different kinds of radiation\"></a></p>\n",

For example, external exposure to low-energy betas might be harmless because the betas would be stopped by your clothing.</p>\n",
            " <p>The key difference is in terms of ionisation potential. Beta radiation will ionise atoms that it passes, though not as strongly as alpha radiation. Gamma rays do not directly ionise particles, although they may cause particles they interact with to emit ionising radiation.</p>\n",

Let me try to give some general idea of the processes.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a single gamma ray with an energy of 100 keV and project it towards the body, it will most likely penetrate several cm, Compton scatter a number of times, depositing a fraction of energy at each interaction. Finally it either escapes or its energy is fully absorbed. The lower-energy electrons that absorbed some of its energy will bounce around the tissue locally, causing ionization and potentially some damage to the DNA/RNA of cells. If these cells do not repair the damage, they may malfunction.

Gas laws is applied here as the volume is fixed and change in pressure causes temperature to rise.</p>\n",
            " <p>Interesting question! Thinking about this as two pistons of equal velocity - rather than a train carriage - helped me conceive the problem:</p>\n<p>First, think about it as a continuum problem - you are talking about a gas, but for the acceleration stage I think this does not affect the picture materially. Taking the reference frame of the gas between the two pistons, <em>and noting this is not an inertial reference frame during acceleration</em>, then there will be higher pressure on the rear piston if the gas is undergoing linear acceleration [note that I have considered the acceleration as an inertial force - I think it helps to use the non-inertial reference frame of the gas]:\n<span class=\"math-container\">$$\\sum F_x = P_1\\cdot A - P_2\\cdot A - \\rho_{g,0}\\cdot A\\cdot L \\cdot a_x = 0$$</span></p>\n<p>Depending on the acceleration, you can now compute the pressure difference that would be observed, which depends on the density of the gas and the length of the cylinder and is independent of the area. Turning the problem on its side, it resembles the hydrostatic force balance (note that I have used the initial density; for strong accelerations, there will be a non-negligible density gradient opposite to the acceleration - but it doesn't affect this calculation).</p>\n<p>If the acceleration is extremely gradual, then this pressure difference is extremely small, such that the acceleration could be considered 'quasistatic'. Under this scenario, the gas should acquire axial momentum without any change to its incoherent motion (in its reference frame). After the acceleration is removed, the pressures are equal on the front and rear pistons, and the gas has acquired a coherent kinetic energy of <span class=\"math-container\">$\\rho_g\\cdot A\\cdot L \\cdot \\frac{V_x^2}{2}$</span> (this is equal to the work done by the pistons - the train has had to accelerate this gas, and the kinetic energy is the 'deceleration potential energy' relative to a particular reference frame). The coherent component of kinetic energy can be separated from the incoherent kinetic energy of the gas (which is treated as one component of the internal energy):\n<span class=\"math-container\">$$u_1 + w = u_2 + \\frac{V_2^2}{2}$$</span>\nBy assuming the acceleration was quasistatic and adiabatic, the internal energy of the gas hasn't changed. Its density also hasn't changed, so the thermodynamic state of the gas is unchanged.</p>\n<p>If the train were very gradually decelerated, then this process could be reversed - and the gas temperature would again be unchanged, and the work done decelerating the gas could be used to raise a weight, or coil a spring (or heat the brakes of the train for that matter). But this isn't what you asked.</p>\n<p>Intuition suggests that the limiting case is where no work is extracted from the deceleration process - the container stops instantaneously, and it is an irreversible process. By conservation of energy, if the box is adiabatic and constant-volume:\n<span class=\"math-container\">$$u_2+\\frac{V_2^2}{2} = u_3$$</span></p>\n<p>If we were on a Maglev train, traveling at around 167 m/s, this would be 14 kJ/kg of coherent kinetic energy that goes to internal energy (incl. incoherent kinetic energy).</p>\n<p>If the gas was room-temperature air, and we treat <span class=\"math-container\">$c_v$</span> as constant with a value 718 J/kg.K, the temperature rise would then be:\n<span class=\"math-container\">$$\\Delta T = \\frac{\\Delta u}{c_v} =  \\frac{14000}{718} = 19 \\mathrm{K}$$</span></p>\n",

Suppose, a train is moving at an acceleration of say, 5 m/s^2.For an observer at rest outside the train(Observer A) the temperature of the gas will definitely rise (very negligibly because the train is moving at slower speeds with respect to light). Whereas an observer(Observer B) inside the train will see no change in the temperature as according to the observer B the container of the gas and the particles of the gas are at rest and experience no acceleration.</p>\n",
            " <p>Yes the work done by the normal force applied by the train in decreasing would come in the form of increase in temperature.<br />\nYou can use the formula<span class=\"math-container\">$${KE_{sys}= KE_{w.r.t com}+KE_{of com}}$$</span>\nActually the temperature is related to kinetic energy w.r.t centre of mass only.

All I know form vector addition that vectors can be added which act at the same point/particle.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I think, we cannot add forces on a rigid body acting at different points. If we could, then the net force on the rod would be zero, and assuming Newton's 2nd law is applicable, then it says the acceleration of the rod it zero. But the rod rotates and therefore, various points on the rod do accelerate. One might say that the centre-of-mass doesn't accelerate. However, if we apply Newton's second law directly to a rod, one has no clue whether the acceleration $\\textbf{a}$ sitting on the RHS of $\\textbf{F}=m\\textbf{a}$ is really that of the centre-of-mass. And to arrive at the concept of centre-of-mass one really have to use Newton's third law independent of Newton's second law (as it is done for a system of N-particles). </p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

It doesn't take you 1 second to read Earth from your perspective, it takes much less time because the distance between the moon and the earth gets Lorentz contracted. On the other hand, someone observing you from Earth will see you take 1 second to reach him from the moon, but he will observe your clock as having only progressed the .002 seconds that you yourself observe as the amount of time it takes to cross the distance (because your time has become dilated to him). The trouble you're having is that you are mixing up the relativistic effects of different reference frames. </p>\n",
            " <p>Your question seems to talk about massive objects so I'll discuss massive objects. You have a misconception. If you start out $ 3 \\cdot 10^9$ meters away from me, and head towards me at $.99c\\approx 3\\cdot 10^8$ meters per second (close enough for our purposes!), I will observe that you get here in 10 seconds. If I look at a clock you're holding (say you're a group of particles that have a specific half life, and when you get to me I'll measure how much of that original particle is left), I will observe that only $t/\\gamma $ seconds have elapsed for you. In this case, $t=10\\text{s}$ and $\\gamma=(1-.99^2)^{-1/2}=10$, so only one second will have elapsed for you. </p>\n\n<p>But this is absolutely symmetric. Nothing is accelerating, so you have full rights to look at the situation as if I'm the one traveling towards you. From your perspective, your time isn't dilated at all, it's my time that is dilated, and it's dilated by the exact same factor as before. So <em>IF</em> the distance between you and I from your frame was still $3\\cdot 10^9$ meters, we would have a contradiction, because as discussed before my frame would observe that you had $1$ second of decay occur, while your frame would observe it took me ten seconds to get to you, so $10$ seconds of decay would occur. However, this isn't a contradiction because we haven't factored in length contraction!</p>\n\n<p>From my perspective you're travelling at $3\\cdot 10^8$ meters per second towards me, starting from a distance of $3\\cdot 10^9$ meters. But from your perspective, I'm travelling towards you at a speed of $3\\cdot 10^8$ meters per second, starting out at a distance of $3\\cdot 10^9/\\gamma=3\\cdot 10^8$ meters. That speed at that velocity will get me to you in $1$ second. No contradiction.</p>\n\n<p>All that this means is that you can get to the earth - from your perspective - as fast as you want. As you accelerate to relativistic speeds you'll find the distance between you and the earth shrinking (length contraction) and so the trip will seem to take almost no time at all, provided you accelerate enough. On earth, however, you get closer and closer to $c$ and may have more and more energy, but your speed stays approximately constant as you get very close to $c$ and so it will always take $d/c$ seconds, NEVER 5,000 years!</p>\n\n<p>So, one might realize that to get <em>really</em> meaningful effects one shouldn't consider constant velocity problems. If you introduce acceleration, then you can get meaningful effects. Considering the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox\" rel=\"nofollow\">twin paradox</a> for example, one finds $t_{\\text{earth}}=\\gamma t_{\\text{spaceship}}$. So the distance traveled (in Earth's frame of reference), if $v\\approx c$, is $t_{\\text{earth}}c=\\gamma t_{\\text{spaceship}} c$. If the distance to work with (to the moon and back) is a constant $d$, that is, if $\\gamma t_{\\text{spaceship}}c=d$, then considering only large very relativistic velocities with $v/c\\approx 1$, $t_{\\text{earth}}=\\gamma t_{\\text{spaceship}}=d/c$. The time will be constant again! But, of course, we already knew that, and didn't need relativity to answer it. To increase this value one must increase the <em>distance</em>. Increasing the velocity while keeping the distance constant won't help. While this only applies to massive objects, it might be alright to hand wave and say something like, \"This is why the infinite time dilation of a photon doesn't matter when asking how fast does the photon get here\". (in quotes because \"infinite time dilation of a photon\" is used here as a VERY hand-wavey concept.)</p>\n",

If a person stood on a scale at the north pole and observed the scale reading (his weight) to be $mg$, what would the scale read if he stood on it at a point on the equator?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I decided to try to solve it myself, first with intuition, and then a diagram.</p>\n\n<p>My intuition tells me that weight (as seen on a scale) is the normal force $N$. On the North Pole, $N = W$, where $W$ is the weight. However, on the Equator, there is a centrifugal force. Like on a merry-go-round, one is pull away from the Earth. That means $N$ is \"lightened\" as such: $N = W - C$. From there, simple calculations are made to get a numerical answer. <strong>According to other sources, this is correct.</strong></p>\n\n<p>However, I tried solving this \"without ever being on a merry-go-round\". I draw a diagram. Draw the earth as a circle, with a person as a point. To the center, there is $W$, because $W$ is in the direction of the mass. In addition, centripetal force ($C$) is pointed to the center of a spinning object (i.e. same way as $W$). Opposing both is $N$. So, I get $N = W + C$. This is different than the above equation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do I go wrong in my second solution?</strong></p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>The problem you are having is that you are thinking of \"the centripetal force\" as a force that you have to account for in drawing your diagrams. Not entirely you fault. The phrase does read that way.</p>\n\n<p>Basic rule: there is no thing called \"<em>the</em> centripetal force\". Instead that  phase is a label for some combination of real force to take on the role of causing the inward acceleration that must be present for curving motion to occur. What combination of forces varies from problem to problem and even from time to time in a single situation. What that combination <em>is</em> is something that you have to discover in each problem. </p>\n\n<p>But you do have one hint. The simple kinematics of the motion tell you what the magnitude of acceleration must be.</p>\n\n<p>In this case $F_c = |\\text{gravity times mass}| - |\\text{normal reaction force}|$. This is a specific case of the general rule that centripetal force is the sum of the inward pointing forces (or components of forces) minus the sum of the outward pointing ones.<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n<p>Secondly, you need to know that a bathroom scale measures the normal force between the person and the ground. This gives us a different understanding of \"weight\" than $mg$ (and it is one that works right when we say a astronaut in orbit is \"weightless\").</p>\n\n<p>So, \n$$\\text{weight} = \\text{normal reaction force} = mg - m\\frac{v^2}{r}\\,,$$\nis the expected reading on the scale at the equator.<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To expand a little on the \"why\" of this approach, I want to start by talking about equilibrium.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have identified that some object is in equilibrium then you know something about the forces acting on it in aggregate: they add up to zero. That doesn't tell you about any single <em>a priori</em>, but if you know all the other force (or know that there is only one force) then it lets you finish.</p>\n\n<p>The \"centripetal force\" is very much like that: because the object is in curving motion you know that it is <em>not</em> in equilibrium but accelerating, and furthermore you know that the component of its acceleration that points to the (instantaneous) center of curvature is $a_c v^2/r = r\\omega^2$.</p>\n\n<p>And <em>that</em> tells you that the total of all the radial forces acting on it must be $ma_c$ (and again, this is something you know about a collection of forces).

The phrase does read that way.</p>\n\n<p>Basic rule: there is no thing called \"<em>the</em> centripetal force\". Instead that  phase is a label for some combination of real force to take on the role of causing the inward acceleration that must be present for curving motion to occur. What combination of forces varies from problem to problem and even from time to time in a single situation. What that combination <em>is</em> is something that you have to discover in each problem. </p>\n\n<p>But you do have one hint. The simple kinematics of the motion tell you what the magnitude of acceleration must be.</p>\n\n<p>In this case $F_c = |\\text{gravity times mass}| - |\\text{normal reaction force}|$. This is a specific case of the general rule that centripetal force is the sum of the inward pointing forces (or components of forces) minus the sum of the outward pointing ones.<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n<p>Secondly, you need to know that a bathroom scale measures the normal force between the person and the ground. This gives us a different understanding of \"weight\" than $mg$ (and it is one that works right when we say a astronaut in orbit is \"weightless\").</p>\n\n<p>So, \n$$\\text{weight} = \\text{normal reaction force} = mg - m\\frac{v^2}{r}\\,,$$\nis the expected reading on the scale at the equator.<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To expand a little on the \"why\" of this approach, I want to start by talking about equilibrium.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have identified that some object is in equilibrium then you know something about the forces acting on it in aggregate: they add up to zero. That doesn't tell you about any single <em>a priori</em>, but if you know all the other force (or know that there is only one force) then it lets you finish.</p>\n\n<p>The \"centripetal force\" is very much like that: because the object is in curving motion you know that it is <em>not</em> in equilibrium but accelerating, and furthermore you know that the component of its acceleration that points to the (instantaneous) center of curvature is $a_c v^2/r = r\\omega^2$.</p>\n\n<p>And <em>that</em> tells you that the total of all the radial forces acting on it must be $ma_c$ (and again, this is something you know about a collection of forces).

Particles are on the same status as antiparticles and nothing particular \"flashes\" unless there is an interaction. Interaction means energy and momentum is exchanged. Usually particles and antiparticles annihilate when they interact, and a plethora of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Feynman diagrams</a> describes pictorially the mathematics of their interaction.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But according to quantum field theory, every particle has an anti-particle (besides the majorana fermion).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Particles can be antiparticles of themselves, as for example the photon.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>To preface my question, I ask this as a mathematics student, so I don't have a very good sense of how physicists think.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the historical context I'm imagining (in particular taking into account the development of differential geometry in the 19th century):</p>\n\n<p>Classical mechanics is about Lagrangians of matter fields on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (with the flat metric)</p>\n\n<p>Sometime in the 1820s Gauss speculated about replacing the flat metric on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ by one with non-vanishing curvature</p>\n\n<p>Special relativity is about Lagrangians of matter fields on $\\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$ (with the flat metric). I'm taking this jump for granted since as I understand it, it was arrived at from experimental results on electromagnetism at the end of the 19th century.</p>\n\n<p>Now in line with Gauss, it seems like it would be extremely natural to speculate about replacing the flat metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$ by one with non-vanishing curvature (and in the same spirit also considering more exotic topologies for the underlying manifold).</p>\n\n<p>Given that then we would have to ask exactly which metric we are looking for, it seems natural to say that there should be a Lagrangian term corresponding to the metric. The Einstein-Hilbert functional is probably the simplest one to try. And so we get the Einstein equations.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively (as I heard from someone is the actual history) you could observe that the energy-momentum tensor is of course a 2-tensor, and so for an Euler-Lagrange equation the most natural metric-dependent expression would be $\\operatorname{Ric}=T$. Since $T$ is always divergence free it would be natural to replace $\\operatorname{Ric}$ by $\\operatorname{Ric}-\\frac{1}{2}Rg$ just from taking the contracted second Bianchi identity into account. And so again we get the Einstein equations.</p>\n\n<p>I've often heard it said that if Einstein had not come up with special relativity, someone else probably would have in the next five or ten years. However if he had not come up with general relativity, it would have taken much longer to discover. <b>Why is this?</b> I feel that I must be missing something here.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

A detailed account on this subject can be found on the following Physics SE question: <a href=\"https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/56892/did-hilbert-publish-general-relativity-field-equation-before-einstein/\" title=\"Did Hilbert publish GR before Einstein?\">Did Hilbert publish GR before Einstein?</a>, and I can quote Pais' biography of Einstein on this subject (for a beautiful account of this particular episode of the development of GR, check chapters 11-14 of \"Subtle is the Lord\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Let us come back to Einstein's paper of November 18. It was written at a time in which (by his own admission) he was beside himself about his perihelion discovery (formally announced that same day), very tired, unwell, and still at work on the November 25 paper <em>[the paper called \"The Field Equations of Gravitation\"]</em>. It seems most implausible to me that he would have been in a frame of mind to absorb the content of the technically difficult paper Hilbert had sent him on November 18. More than a year later, Felix Klein wrote that he found the equations in that paper so complicated that he had not checked them. [...]</p>\n  \n  <p>I rather subscribe to Klein's opinion that the two men 'talked past\n  each other, which is not rare among simultaneously productive\n  mathematicians'[...] I again agree with Klein 'that there can be no\n  question of priority, since both authors pursued entirely different\n  trains of thought to such an extent that the compatibility of the\n  results did not at once seem assured'. I do believe that <strong>Einstein was\n  the sole creator of the physical theory of general relativity</strong> and that\n  <strong>both he and Hilbert should be credited for the discovery of the\n  fundamental equation</strong>.</p>\n  \n  <p>I am not sure that the two protagonists would have agreed <em>[included as\n  a funny note]</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Subtle is the Lord, Chapter 14, page 260. I think this supports my previous statement quite well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why isn't general relativity the obvious thing to try after special relativity?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think this question can only be answered if we are talking about the teaching of the subject to undergrads in college. If we were talking about one teaching him-/herself GR after learning SR, I believe that the answer would be \"well, mostly because one doesn't want to/couldn't do it; in fact, one could have done it before\", or something along those lines, which doesn't quite help.</p>\n\n<p>When talking about teaching SR to undergrads, you've got to understand this: there isn't a standard for teaching the theories of Relativity to undergrads (written as an as-of-yet undergrad). We mostly get taught versions of the theory with not so much emphasis on the mathematical structures lying below the subject, and get mostly taught to do calculations and think of the dynamics. So we, in these cases, don't always get to know the concepts of metric, of flat spacetime (which we actually use, but almost never think about it for the course), of curved spacetime, among others. </p>\n\n<p>Add to that the fact that, in many universities (such as mine and the one's of many of my acquaintances), we don't get to learn much math (besides Calculus, some Linear Algebra and Complex Variables) before plunging into the vast world of physics subjects, so we are not in a position to say \"oh, of course, this concept that I saw when learning SR can be, by analogy with these things which I haven't learned, extended to a more general (and complicated) one, which would link to some variational principle in order to get some new and complicated tensor equations, which we can't solve\". </p>\n\n<p>So well, if you see it from a mathematician's  point of view (yours), the next step from SR is quite obvious because of the mathematics you know, but if you are a physics undergrad, who has (most likely) not had an intense training in mathematics, you are certainly not going to be able to take that step. Though I may be generalizing horribly, but all that I've said is true, in my experience.</p>\n",

I'll try to answer both, in spite of not being an expert neither on GR nor on the education on physics.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is it, if it is true, that GR would have taken many more years to discover, had Einstein not discovered it?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I agree with you and the comments to your question in saying that GR would most likely have emerged, in the following years  (though \"how many years?\" is a question which I don't think anybody can answer) as a consequence of the equations given by Hilbert in the paper he published at almost the same time. A detailed account on this subject can be found on the following Physics SE question: <a href=\"https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/56892/did-hilbert-publish-general-relativity-field-equation-before-einstein/\" title=\"Did Hilbert publish GR before Einstein?\">Did Hilbert publish GR before Einstein?</a>, and I can quote Pais' biography of Einstein on this subject (for a beautiful account of this particular episode of the development of GR, check chapters 11-14 of \"Subtle is the Lord\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Let us come back to Einstein's paper of November 18. It was written at a time in which (by his own admission) he was beside himself about his perihelion discovery (formally announced that same day), very tired, unwell, and still at work on the November 25 paper <em>[the paper called \"The Field Equations of Gravitation\"]</em>. It seems most implausible to me that he would have been in a frame of mind to absorb the content of the technically difficult paper Hilbert had sent him on November 18. More than a year later, Felix Klein wrote that he found the equations in that paper so complicated that he had not checked them. [...]</p>\n  \n  <p>I rather subscribe to Klein's opinion that the two men 'talked past\n  each other, which is not rare among simultaneously productive\n  mathematicians'[...] I again agree with Klein 'that there can be no\n  question of priority, since both authors pursued entirely different\n  trains of thought to such an extent that the compatibility of the\n  results did not at once seem assured'. I do believe that <strong>Einstein was\n  the sole creator of the physical theory of general relativity</strong> and that\n  <strong>both he and Hilbert should be credited for the discovery of the\n  fundamental equation</strong>.</p>\n  \n  <p>I am not sure that the two protagonists would have agreed <em>[included as\n  a funny note]</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Subtle is the Lord, Chapter 14, page 260. I think this supports my previous statement quite well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why isn't general relativity the obvious thing to try after special relativity?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think this question can only be answered if we are talking about the teaching of the subject to undergrads in college. If we were talking about one teaching him-/herself GR after learning SR, I believe that the answer would be \"well, mostly because one doesn't want to/couldn't do it; in fact, one could have done it before\", or something along those lines, which doesn't quite help.</p>\n\n<p>When talking about teaching SR to undergrads, you've got to understand this: there isn't a standard for teaching the theories of Relativity to undergrads (written as an as-of-yet undergrad). We mostly get taught versions of the theory with not so much emphasis on the mathematical structures lying below the subject, and get mostly taught to do calculations and think of the dynamics. So we, in these cases, don't always get to know the concepts of metric, of flat spacetime (which we actually use, but almost never think about it for the course), of curved spacetime, among others. </p>\n\n<p>Add to that the fact that, in many universities (such as mine and the one's of many of my acquaintances), we don't get to learn much math (besides Calculus, some Linear Algebra and Complex Variables) before plunging into the vast world of physics subjects, so we are not in a position to say \"oh, of course, this concept that I saw when learning SR can be, by analogy with these things which I haven't learned, extended to a more general (and complicated) one, which would link to some variational principle in order to get some new and complicated tensor equations, which we can't solve\". </p>\n\n<p>So well, if you see it from a mathematician's  point of view (yours), the next step from SR is quite obvious because of the mathematics you know, but if you are a physics undergrad, who has (most likely) not had an intense training in mathematics, you are certainly not going to be able to take that step. Though I may be generalizing horribly, but all that I've said is true, in my experience.</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Recently, an increasing number of people have started advising moving away from FileZilla. However, the only reason I can see for this is that FileZilla stores the connection information in a completely unencrypted form, but as Mozilla says - surely it is the job  of the operating system to protect the configuration files?</p>\n\n<p>So, is there any other reason why I should no longer use FileZilla, as I've never had any problems with it? Somebody mentioned to me that the way it works isn't secure either, but I think they were just getting confused over the fact FTP transmits passwords in plain text anyway. </p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [

            " <p>FileZilla per se isn't inherently insecure. Yes, it's storing passwords in plaintext, but the alternatives are only slightly more secure. You see, encrypting the credentials requires an encryption key which needs to be stored somewhere. If a malware is running on your user account, they have as much access to what you (or any other application running at the same level) have. Meaning they will also have access to the encryption keys or the keys encrypting the encryption keys and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Your best option here is to disable password storage in FileZilla</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4cgAA.png\" alt=\"disable-password-save-filezilla\"></p>\n\n<p>Then start using <a href=\"http://keepass.info/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">KeePass</a> to store your account credentials. There are also many <a href=\"http://sww.co.nz/an-alternative-to-storing-passwords-in-filezilla-or-other-ftp-clients/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">guides on the Internet about how to integrate KeePass with FileZilla</a>. Doing this, you're storing the encryption key somewhere where malware don't have access; you're storing the encryption key (or rather, the password from which the encryption key is derived) in your brain.</p>\n\n<p>Finally (and perhaps this is a bit outside the scope of your question), please make sure you move away from FTP in favor of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SFTP</a>.</p>\n",
            " <p>It may be because they recently made deals to start bundling malware with their downloads, and one of their developers has given people real bad attitude, claiming things from it's not malware to it's not his decision to quips like you can choose not to install it once you first install the malware laden installer.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=30240\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=30240</a></p>\n\n<p>It could be the passwords stored in plain text, but I really doubt that's so much an issue to the security crowd as bundling malware in the installer, adding options that nuke all your passwords poorly in the quickconnect bar, and just the recently poor attitude towards people trying to complain about these recent-ish changes.  The attitude seems to be that you can always opt out of the malware install options if you know what your doing, once you download the malware laden installer.</p>\n",
            " <p>I think one of the main reason people advise to move away from Filezilla is clearly the fact passwords are stored as plain text and thus, easilly stolen.\nFilezilla bad reputation began some years ago when some malwares began to target specifically Filezilla. \nUsing critical flaws in third party softwares (namely flash and acrobat reader) these malwares were able to steal the XML passowrd file Filezilla uses to store the passwords.\nMost of the time, these malwares were eradicated and cleaned in a few seconds, but the data was stolen.\nThese stolen credential files were then handled in a very complicated bot zombie network which connected to each and every ftp contained in the file, scanned it then propagated malware in every index.html/php file found on these FTP. In less than 2 hours, all the ftp websites stored in filezilla were infected.\nAt the time, the process has been very well documented by some victim webmasters.</p>\n\n<p>Probably thousands of webmasters, tens of thousands of websites, were infected because of this. Many many complained about the fact the passwords were not encrypted.</p>\n\n<p>The second reason people advise to move away from Filezilla is the reaction of the developper team : instead of adding this feature, they just refused every argument, either sending back the responsibility to badly secured systems or pretending that encrypting passwords would not change anything, that it was system's responsibility to secure data.</p>\n\n<p>So for now, if you still want to use Filezilla (which is a good ftp client) you really should consider disabling all password storing options and using a third party tool like Keepass. It's a bit of a pain in the <em>*</em> but it's safer. \nYou may even find bonus advantages with Keepass because you'll have a tool to centralize cross-protocol credentials in a safer way</p>\n",
            " <p>FileZilla does come with malware now and the developers are aware and probably getting money from it.</p>\n\n<p>Search for FileZilla Premieropinion in Google or read any of the MANY threads on Filezilla's forum:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=31967&amp;start=30\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=31967&amp;start=30</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=30240\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=30240</a></p>\n\n<p>The developer keeps saying that you have the option to opt-out but the installer is CLEARLY designed to misguide people. I work on the tech industry (so I am generally aware of security concerns) and I got fooled, like countless others. It was also my first experience of malware with Macs.</p>\n\n<p>I will never use FileZilla again. Even if you can \"opt-out\" this is clearly designed to fool the users and worst of all the developer is just copy pasting a dishonest reply on FileZilla's forums. So even if the software might still work, I will never accept the attitude of the developer. The issue is not trying to monetize your work. The issue is trying to fool your users.</p>\n",

Encryption, digital signature, decryption, and signature verification are all done at the <em>endpoints</em> by the <em>client software</em>.  The intervening e-mail servers and service providers have nothing to do with this, as the messages get passed along just like any other.  Further, and perhaps most importantly, S/MIME must be supported by both the <em>sending and receiving clients</em> in order to work.  This is beyond the ability of any single e-mail provider to ensure.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, I'm not aware of any common freemail provider (i.e.: GMail, Yahoo, Hotmail) that is currently facilitating S/MIME in their browser-based clients.  Certainly none of them are, nor would they want to be, enabling it as a default.</p>\n\n<p>The reason this cannot work at the service provider level is because of the requirement for both endpoint clients to support the protocol.  Since the service provider of the sender has no control over the client software used by the recipient, enforcing S/MIME use on outbound messages would result in many (if not most) recipients not being able to read the sender's e-mails.</p>\n\n<p>The only conditions under which S/MIME will work are when all participants in the e-mail conversation have S/MIME-compatible clients, and everyone has (and has verified) each others' public keys.  Again, this is not something that any individual e-mail service provider can effect.  They may conceivably be able to facilitate this between their own users, but they do not have the same power to protect e-mails going to/from external endpoints.</p>\n\n<p>SSL/TLS are technologies commonly used to secure communications between clients and servers and from server-to-server.  However, here we again run into a similar situation as with S/MIME - both parties to the conversation must support it.  While some service providers may do this, no service provider can guarantee you that SSL/TLS will be applied to every message you send because they do not have control over what the receiving server is configured to support.</p>\n\n<p>To address your concerns more concisely, point-by-point:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>None of the above use S/MIME.  While it would be a nice feature for them to support in their web clients, it would be infeasible for them to guarantee that it will work for all recipients.  You can get around this to some degree by using your own e-mail client with S/MIME support, instead of using the web interfaces.  However, again, this will only work where you have coordinated this with your intended recipients.</p></li>\n<li><p>SSL/TLS is commonly used to protect the web sessions by which e-mails are composed, and the client connections by which they are sent.  It's also used to protect server-to-server communications along the way, but no service provider can guarantee that every recipient's e-mail servers or client will support and maintain that protection along the way.</p></li>\n<li><p>Many providers do use SSL/TLS, but you should check with yours yourself if you're concerned.  Again, though, this cannot guarantee that your e-mail is protected through transmission and storage every step along the way to every recipient.</p></li>\n<li><p>Any time you are sending/receiving e-mail which is not protected by S/MIME, PGP, or a similar end-to-end encryption solution, you must assume that the message has been transmitted or stored in the clear, or in another form readable by a third-party, <em>somewhere</em>.  </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The last point touches on an issue I've not yet addressed - e-mail storage on the server.  All e-mail service providers, by the nature of their service, must store e-mails exactly as they were received or by using some form of encryption that they themselves can reverse.  Otherwise, they will not be able to forward the e-mail on in a readable format to others or display it to you in your web browser.  If you're not using end-to-end encryption, that means your e-mail is being effectively stored in the clear.  This leaves it vulnerable to malicious insiders, or anyone who manages to hack into your e-mail account or the server's database.</p>\n",
            " <ol>\n<li>No</li>\n<li>SSL is used but not as an S/MIME replacement</li>\n<li>Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail allow you to access your e-mail via SSL. And similarly will send e-mails using SSL but only <em>where possible</em>. It's difficult to say whether <strong>all</strong> providers do either.</li>\n<li>Pretty much <strong>always</strong>. It is very difficult to guarantee security with these providers without using something on top like PGP. Sure if you send from Gmail to Gmail there's a good chance it will be safe but <em>no guarantee</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n",
            " <p>2 SSL is used in two ways and while the providers seem to be pretty consistent about using it for server to client communications, they vary using it for server to server communication.</p>\n\n<p>I ran some tests and while Gmail and Yahoo both use encryption if both sides support it, Hotmail never uses it for server to server communications.  This means that communication between Hotmail and other internet providers is always in clear text</p>\n",
            " <p>1) In general S/MIME is not supported by Gmail, Yahoo, etc when using their web-based email client (i.e. going to www.gmail.com). If you want to use S/MIME with these services you have to use a 3rd party email client (i.e Mozilla Thunderbird, MS Outlook, etc) and have a way to manage and distribute your public and private keys. The reason it is not easy to use S/MIME with Gmail etc is because the primary source of revenue for these companies is targeted advertising. The primary source of information used to target that advertising is the content of your emails. If they make it easy for you to use S/MIME for end-to-end encryption (so that they can no longer scan your emails) it undercuts their primary source of revenue (information about you).</p>\n\n<p>2) Yes, but keep in mind that protection is often partial or incomplete. Just because the email service provider allows you to connect via SSL/TLS does not mean they support SSL/TLS connections to <em>other</em> email service providers. See 4) below.</p>\n\n<p>3) <strong>No</strong>, ~50% of emails travel to or through providers that do not support SSL/TLS. I believe AOL only started supporting SSL/TLS connections in 2014 (via their web-based email client). See 4) below. </p>\n\n<p>4) Under common conditions emails are not secure for several reasons. First, the email provider is scanning the incoming and outgoing emails to provide targeted advertising. Second, ~50% of the time the connections between the various email service providers do not support ANY encryption so the emails traveling between these providers must be sent as plain text. You have no ability to control this process because it is the connection between the providers. For example, if you send a email from your Gmail account to a friend with a Yahoo account the email must be transmitted from Google's servers to Yahoo's servers. The security of that connection depends he willingness of on Google and Yahoo to work together. I believe Google and Yahoo only recently started supporting encrypted connections to each-other. Google posted some data about this in June (2014).

            " <p>The WPA2-PSK <em>can</em> use both TKIP and (AES based) CCMP, but WPA2-Enterprise use only CCMP. The TKIP/AES refers to a configuration that allows both. As TKIP with RC4 cipher is insecure (and <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/wi-fi-alliance-to-dump-wep-and-tkip-not-soon-enough/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">disallowed</a> by the Wi-Fi Alliance) you shouldn't be using it anymore.</p>\n\n<p>The security modes are pretty clearly summarized e.g. in Chris Hoffman's <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/204697/wi-fi-security-should-you-use-wpa2-aes-wpa2-tkip-or-both/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article on Wi-Fi Security</a> or Penny Hoelscher's blog post on <a href=\"https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/wpa2-aes-tkip/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wpa2-aes-tkip</a>.

            " <p>There is indeed a lot of unclear information out there. Your first idea was correct, to the best of my knowledge. While I can't seem to find an authoritative source right now, <a href=\"https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Wireless_security\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this DD-WRT wiki page</a> explains it the way I understand it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>TKIP vs AES-based CCMP</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Defines the algorithm used for message integrity and confidentiality.</p>\n  \n  <p>WPA was designed to be used with TKIP (and WPA2 designed to use\n  stronger AES-based).</p>\n  \n  <p>However, some devices allow WPA (not WPA2) with AES (and WPA2 with\n  TKIP).</p>\n  \n  <p>AES is optional in WPA; in WPA2 both AES is mandatory, but TKIP is\n  optional.</p>\n  \n  <p>Note that TKIP is not directly comparable to AES; TKIP is an integrity\n  check, AES is an encryption algorithm. In the context of wireless\n  security this actually means TKIP vs \"AES-based CCMP\" (not just AES).</p>\n  \n  <p>TKIP is a lower end encryption protocol (WEP2) and AES is a higher end\n  (WPA2/802.11i) encryption protocol. AES is preferred.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>TKIP+AES</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>This is what the encryption standards are for WEP2 (TKIP) and\n  WPA2/802.11i (AES). It will attempt to use AES if available and fall\n  back to TKIP if not. This setting offers the most compatability but\n  won't guarentee a higher level of encryption if a device falls back to\n  TKIP.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It gets even more confusing; my access point running OpenWRT supports the following modes, among others:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>WPA with CCMP, TKIP, or both </li>\n<li>WPA2 with CCMP, TKIP, or both</li>\n<li>Mixed WPA/WPA2 with CCMP, TKIP, or both</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Nowadays, the only relevant option is WPA2 with CCMP (or WPA3, of course).</p>\n",
            " <p>Some historical perspective should help to shed some light on the confusion. The gist is that \"backward compatibility\" is the reason we still see TKIP around.</p>\n\n<p>802.11-based WLANs originally came only with WEP, which was soon discovered to be too easily cracked to be sufficient for general usage in WLANs.</p>\n\n<p>IEEE started working on 802.11i, an amendment to add a much more robust security framework to 802.11-based WLANs. However, in the meantime, the Wi-Fi Alliance introduced WPA with a stop-gap scheme, TKIP, as it was taking time for 802.11i to be published, and meanwhile, there were fears that the momentum of 802.11 could be broken due to poor security. (the exponential growth of 802.11 from 1999 onwards was part of the reason why the security issues suddenly became so urgent)</p>\n\n<p>TKIP - temporary key integrity protocol - as part of WPA, addresses some of the main problems of WEP related to weaknesses in the use of keys. With TKIP, it was still using RC4 with relatively short keys, but at least, doing much improved key mixing to partially address the security concerns.</p>\n\n<p>Backward compatibility was a major reason for the use of TKIP and other less computationally complex algorithms like MICHAEL in WPA. The issue was that the hardware in many of the WLAN devices in those days was deemed not powerful enough to perform AES encryption/decryption, but at least they could have WPA with TKIP.</p>\n\n<p>Later on, 802.11i was published. WPA2 then appeared, basically incorporating the enhancements introduced in 802.11i. There are both the enterprise and the PSK  modes, but definitely, WPA2-PSK with AES/CCMP is stronger than WPA2-PSK with TKIP.</p>\n\n<p>For backward compatibility reasons (in case you're trying to connect a low end device that doesn't support AES), TKIP is still supported by some WiFi access points (typically, trying AES first and then falling back to TKIP; it could be called by various names like TKIP+AES). But generally, unless you really need to support that one or two old/low end devices in your network, it would be better to just go with WPA2 (PSK or enterprise) with AES/CCMP.</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Back in 2008 a wireless defibrillator was shown to be hackable.  At this year's <em>Black Hat</em> conference a presenter showed exactly how to hack into a wireless insulin pump.  Both of these demonstrated the ability for the potentially lethal hacking of wireless medical devices.</p>\n\n<p>(Here's a shameless plug.)  I and a couple other authors put together a book chapter that mentioned our concerns about security of various wireless medical devices available at <a href=\"http://www.intechopen.com/articles/show/title/wireless-telemedicine-system-an-accurate-reliable-and-secure-real-time-health-care\">http://www.intechopen.com/articles/show/title/wireless-telemedicine-system-an-accurate-reliable-and-secure-real-time-health-care</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While no known lethal viruses exist at this point, manual hacks becoming available brings the concept of such viruses one step closer.  Perhaps I'm a pessimist, but it seems to me that assassination attempts between countries or companies would have the potential for producing such a virus... or just dumb chance that another virus on wireless networks may trigger serious problems with such a devices.  </p>\n\n<p>Do you have similar concerns or am I being overly concerned?  Has anyone else seen or discovered lethal security issues with other wireless medical devices?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

The extent to which that pool overlaps with those with malicious intent is the magnitude of the concern, I think.  </p>\n\n<p>Like anything else in medicine, there is a tradeoff between costs and benefits, so if the convenience to the patient and power to control dosing and other parameters outweighs the risks of an attack by a hacker, then we should continue to provide such devices.  I'm not familiar with the design of such an insulin system, but the firmware should provide some sort of a check to prevent a lethal dose from being given under any circumstances. </p>\n",

It appears that the devices have not been built with security in mind, have not followed good secure development practices, and the medical certification process does not ensure that medical devices are secure.</p>\n\n<p>However, that said, I think you have to keep the risks in perspective.  The leading researchers in this field repeatedly emphasize the lifesaving value of these devices, and are careful to state that their medical benefits outweigh the security risks.  One of them has publicly stated that if he needed one of these implantable devices, he'd get it, no question.</p>\n\n<p>I think talking about remote assassination is... a movie theater risk.  Sure, in principle it may be technologically feasible, but it feels far-fetched and far from the most severe risk for the average every-day person.  Instead, I think at present the greater risk is the potential for accidental or unintentional compromise or interference with medical devices.  With the growth in the use of software in medical devices, what if a software virus unintentionally ends up infecting medical equipment and interferes with their operation?  That's the sort of thing that I think is worth greater attention.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, I would caution you that medical issues are sensitive and personal for many people.  I know that security researchers sometimes get enthusiastic talking about potential worst-case scenario and awe-inspiring exploits, but there's a very real risk here: if security researchers scare the public into avoiding these devices, then the cure would be far worse than the disease.  The security community could end up being indirectly responsible for avoidable deaths if it overstates or dramaticizes the risks before the public.  So, when talking to potential patients, I think it is our responsibility to be extremely careful and professional about how we discuss the issue.</p>\n",
            " <p>While the amount of real damage may remain small, the perceived threat is significant. i.e. the \"scariness factor\" makes securing these devices very important. Others have mentioned the damage caused by patients refusing a device on the basis of security. There's also damage to the reputation of companies that manufacture these devices.</p>\n\n<p>That said, securing implantable devices has its own set of challenges. These devices are designed to run continuously for years--the longer the better. You always run the risk of infection when you replace (implant) a device because its battery has died. In addition, the devices themselves are costly. For this reason, you must balance how much power you use for providing security (encryption, virus checking?) with the power you use for providing therapy.</p>\n\n<p>Many of these devices must also be accessed and reprogrammed at a moments notice by emergency room staff at any hospital (what if the patient comes in with <a href=\"http://www.bostonscientific.com/content/dam/bostonscientific/quality/education-resources/english/ACL_PMT_20120625.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pacemaker Mediated Tachycardia</a>?).

            " <p>So, because I have better things to do, I've just spent a while trying to find a white space character which isn't trimmed by trim, and therefore messes up parse_url, but is a valid white space in the header function.</p>\n\n<p>I found that if I encode the unicode character formfeed, U+000C, and place it before the URL as so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>%0Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Your code will still redirect to Google.

An attacker cannot set a cookie on a remote domain unless they have XSS or HTTP Response Splitting - at that point XSS is much more valuable than a simple open redirect.</p>\n",
            " <p>The validated solution is vulnerable (see other posts). </p>\n\n<p>I suggest you WHITELIST the redirection url's. Even better : use a mapper to a whitelist. </p>\n\n<pre><code>&amp;something=value&amp;redirectUrl=3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>3 being mapped in the backend to a nice URL. By doing this you are secure</p>\n\n<p>If you Whitelist URL's, be careful about parameters as well.. That's why to be 100% sure and have a nice place where all the URL's are stored (which is easy to maintain), I would only allow specific keys (like the \"3\" in the example hereabove) that I would map to clean URL's.</p>\n\n<p>The point of this technique is that you won't have to think about what possible hacks could break you (as you saw with the validated solution, a new idea could pop-up and break your defences). If you apply this technique, you are sure that you control the redirection. </p>\n\n<p>The only (functional) drawback is that you can't redirect to a dynamic URL. Which you most probably don't plan to do, given your use-case :)</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line is : having a redirect URL as a parameter value in a URL is generally a bad idea, as the validation is error-prone. If you can avoid the validation altogether, just do it ! Even if standards evolve (see : relative URL's), you are still safe.</p>\n"

Because a hidden network doesn\u2019t broadcast, your PC can't find it, so the network has to find your PC. For this to happen, your PC must broadcast both the name of the network it's looking for and its own name. <strong>In this situation, other PCs \u201clistening\u201d for networks will know the name of your PC as well as the network you\u2019re connected to, which increases the risk of your PC being attacked.</strong> <sub>(emphasis added)</sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I had always believed that hidden wireless networks were actually safer than normal ones, because only those who already know of the network are able to connect to it, so an attacker wouldn't be able to connect to it to listen to your traffic.</p>\n\n<p>Are hidden networks actually more risky, as the paragraph says, and if so, what measures can be taken to help mitigate the risk?</p>\n\n<p>Also, I know that there are some countries where publicly broadcasting home networks are actually illegal, and hidden networks are the only option for wireless.  If broadcasting networks are safer, why are they illegal in some places?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

But, if you for example install the VPN software provided by the VPN provider, this software could actually silently trust the computer the VPN provider for SSL interception so that you don't realize that the provider can sniff and even modify the encrypted traffic.

            " <blockquote>\n  <p>Can a VPN Provider MitM my SSL traffic without me noticing?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding this specifically, unless they have the web site's private key, then you can notice.  If you trust the VPN provider's certificate in your browser(s), then you have to actively look harder at which cert each site is using, of course, but you CAN notice if you pay attention.  Browser extensions like Certificate Patrol can help if you visit the sites both with and without your VPN; they'll notify on certificate changes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Shouldn't gmail know my real IP if the traffic just gets tunneled through the provider?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maybe; it depends.  The originating IP address is that of the VPN provider; however, if gmail or another web site sends Javascript or another language's scripts to your browser that your browser accepts and runs that collects your IP (or other, even more private information), then sends that to the orginating - or a third party!</p>\n\n<p>If that transmission is over unbroken TLS, your information was only given to the site it was sent to and everyone that that site shares it with willingly or unwillingly.</p>\n\n<p>If that transmission was unencrypted, everyone between you and them ALSO can see it.</p>\n\n<p>If that transmission was encrypted with broken encryption, it's highly complex, but is somewhere between the two extremes above.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I thought about invalid certificates if the ssl gets broken, but how do next gen firewalls like palo alto claim they can do deep packet inspection on ssl traffic without the users noticing? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They do so because they have a copy of the very same private key for the certificate the web server itself uses!  Just as the web server decrypts the TLS traffic with its private key, the appliance decrypts its copy of the traffic with the web server's private key.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why can't the VPN provider just use a similar box to decrypt it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The VPN company having a copy of the end web site's TLS private key would be a highly exceptional circumstance involving major nation-state actors, exceptional criminal activity, and/or the bleeding edge of critical zero day exploits like Heartbleed. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I am a bit curious about how much data a VPN provider could potentially collect about me. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As least as much as you think you allow them to.  </p>\n\n<p>Do you send your DNS requests over the VPN?  They can see that.  If not, your ISP can see it.</p>\n\n<p>Do you allow HTTP traffic?  They can see - and alter in transit - that.  Watch out, that includes third party traffic.</p>\n\n<p>They can definitely see which IP addresses you're going to, and the patterns of data you move.  They can then match that against statistically significant analysis of lots of people's traffic as well as deliberate tests and public information they collect. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>i.e. You send some too large to be simple page request packets to <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com\">https://security.stackexchange.com</a>?  You're submitting something you typed to the Stackexchange network of sites; a simple correlation of those large transmissions with new questions and answers will very quickly reveal your stackexchange username. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Do you allow broken encryption algorithms?  They may or may not be able to see that.</p>\n\n<p>You certainly have zero insight as to what they log, regardless of what they claim (or are forced to claim depending on the governments in control of every server involved in your traffic and of the management of that company and the people in it - if your VPN endpoint, or the corporate management, or the multiply subcontracted server admins is/are in RepressiveRegimeX, RepressiveRegimeX has a great deal of power over it.</p>\n\n<p>Try, at least for awhile, Firefox with the <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/umatrix/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">uMatrix plugin</a> (to show you the mappings of what third party requests are being made by the sites you visit), and with <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HTTPS Everywhere</a> to limit the use of HTTP.</p>\n\n<p>Also in Firefox, go to about:config, search on tls to see the TLS versions allowed, and search on ssl3 to see which cipher suites are enabled.  </p>\n\n<p>On each browser you use, go to <a href=\"https://www.ssllabs.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SSLLabs</a> and do a client test to see what might be weak that that browser allows on that machine; remove those.</p>\n\n<p>As an advanced option, use <a href=\"https://www.wireshark.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wireshark</a> or another tool to watch what's actually going over your VPN, and what's not.  You may - or may not - be able to see an actual TLS connection being made, so you can see the cipher suite or algorithm choice negotiated. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pay particular attention to where your DNS requests, UDP port 53, are going.

            " <p>The short answer is: Your VPN provider can do anything your ISP can do if you're not using a VPN. </p>\n\n<p>This may include breaking TLS, if your browser trusts a root CA, which issued an intermediate certificate for middle boxes. You're shifting the trust in not doing so from your ISP to the VPN provider.</p>\n\n<p>Most such middle boxes require the users to install a new root CA. You're protected against that, because you probably didn't install a certificate from you VPN provider. But there were some appliances which had valid browser trusted intermediate certificates in the past. I am not sure if there are still some.</p>\n",
            " <p>Unhappy with the existing answers because \u2014under normal circumstances\u2014 it's simply <strong>No</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>A VPN is just your connection. They can attempt to block, or strip SSL, but if you make a SSL connection to another site, using a well trusted, un-interfered with certificate chain, data to and from your browser is encrypted from your VPN provider.</p>\n\n<p>They can see [roughly] where you're connecting. They see the IP addresses and ports. All the content over TLS (including host requests in HTTP) is encrypted away from them. The VPN provider may also be able to see what DNS requests your browser is making, though this is less indicative of what you're <em>doing</em> because browsers fire off millions of these as you browse around. You can get separately encrypted DNS if this is an issue.</p>\n\n<p>Palo Alto's firewalls <em>will</em> be stripping and resigning but the only way this will look legitimate to a user is if they've (or their corporate computer provider) installed Palo Alto's root certificates. This is very far from a standard setup.</p>\n\n<p>SSL and TLS don't care about IP addresses. Gmail doesn't need to know your real IP to function, although they and other services may flag intercontinental hops (more common with Tor) as suspicious behaviour and get you to verify that it's just you more frequently.</p>\n",

When I think of why I should use a good password, I immediately think because some website's database is going to be compromised and the attacker is going to have a hash of my password with all the time in the world to brute-force it. So if you think in terms of that then it should convince you more on why a strong password is worth the effort. Unless an attacker has a specific reason to go after you, they probably aren't going to waste their time with a login form on a website, they are going for databases</p>\n\n<p>If you use a simple or short password then the hash might already have been cracked. Unless you are dealing with a persistent actor then attackers usually go for low hanging fruit, meaning if they have a database of hashes, they are going to crack all easy ones and get what they can and make a quick buck. This also reinforces the use of a password manager because if you reuse passwords across multiple accounts then you just made the attackers life easier and that is where password managers are extremely helpful.</p>\n",

PCI compliance, for example, requires account lock-out for at least 30 minutes after 6 failed attempts. The biggest problem in preventing these attacks is working against botnets with thousands of computers without causing a denial of service.  How do you prevent thousands of computers each trying to log in a few times without also locking out the user when they mistype their password while using a new computer, or using the same proxy as the botnet?</p>\n\n<p>There are other ways other than lockouts to <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/42271/how-can-you-i-detect-low-frequency-brute-forcing-over-multiple-connections\">rate-limit attackers, like asking for CAPTCHA</a>. However, there are <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448963/has-recaptcha-been-cracked-hacked-ocrd-defeated-broken/549859#549859\">some ways to work around CAPTCHA</a>.  This <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blocking_Brute_Force_Attacks\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OWASP page</a> discusses more of the best ways to block brute-force attacks.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Longer Passwords Help</h2>\n\n<p>A few decades ago when Unix was king, it was considered that five-character passwords <a href=\"https://spqr.eecs.umich.edu/courses/cs660sp11/papers/10.1.1.128.1635.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">were pretty good</a>.  Now the stakes are higher, advanced hardware is cheap, and hashes can be broken faster than ever so the requirements for good passwords are higher.  This is part of the reason more companies are pushing for longer passwords.</p>\n\n<p>Longer passwords help because the difficulty of password cracking goes up exponentially with password complexity.  <strong>Just adding one random word to your password can make it thousands of times more expensive to guess</strong>- the difference between seconds and hours of cracking time.  Adding another random word turns those hours into years.</p>\n\n<p>Many people advocate for using symbols and creating passwords from larger and larger character sets to make passwords more difficult to crack.  However, <a href=\"http://www.guanotronic.com/~serge/papers/chi11b.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">several</a> <a href=\"http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2012/papers/4681a523.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">examples</a> in <a href=\"http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2012/papers/4681a523.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">research</a> show that requiring longer passwords instead of very complex passwords leads to harder-to-crack passwords (and is more user friendly).  The longer passwords side was also famously supported by xkcd's <a href=\"https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/936:_Password_Strength\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"correct horse\" method to generate passwords</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One caveat is that longer passwords aren't always more secure since extra characters can make a password more predictable.  \"orrect horse battery staple\" is more secure than \"correct horse battery staple\", although the latter is much more memorable.  Good password meters like <a href=\"https://telepathwords.research.microsoft.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Telepathwords</a> or zxcvbn take this into account and will warn you when the extra characters are predictable.</p>\n\n<h2>How Long Should Passwords Be?</h2>\n\n<p>The specifics of how long your password has to be, and how hard it is to crack, can't be answered without knowing how your password is generated, how the password is hashed on the server, and the attacker's resources. For <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/144/how-long-should-the-password-be\">more details see this question</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I'll warn you, that password policy is a matter of opinion.  I've tried to show the best solution based on research, but there are some experts who disagree with me.</p>\n"

This <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blocking_Brute_Force_Attacks\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OWASP page</a> discusses more of the best ways to block brute-force attacks.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Longer Passwords Help</h2>\n\n<p>A few decades ago when Unix was king, it was considered that five-character passwords <a href=\"https://spqr.eecs.umich.edu/courses/cs660sp11/papers/10.1.1.128.1635.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">were pretty good</a>.  Now the stakes are higher, advanced hardware is cheap, and hashes can be broken faster than ever so the requirements for good passwords are higher.  This is part of the reason more companies are pushing for longer passwords.</p>\n\n<p>Longer passwords help because the difficulty of password cracking goes up exponentially with password complexity.  <strong>Just adding one random word to your password can make it thousands of times more expensive to guess</strong>- the difference between seconds and hours of cracking time.  Adding another random word turns those hours into years.</p>\n\n<p>Many people advocate for using symbols and creating passwords from larger and larger character sets to make passwords more difficult to crack.  However, <a href=\"http://www.guanotronic.com/~serge/papers/chi11b.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">several</a> <a href=\"http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2012/papers/4681a523.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">examples</a> in <a href=\"http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2012/papers/4681a523.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">research</a> show that requiring longer passwords instead of very complex passwords leads to harder-to-crack passwords (and is more user friendly).  The longer passwords side was also famously supported by xkcd's <a href=\"https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/936:_Password_Strength\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"correct horse\" method to generate passwords</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One caveat is that longer passwords aren't always more secure since extra characters can make a password more predictable.  \"orrect horse battery staple\" is more secure than \"correct horse battery staple\", although the latter is much more memorable.  Good password meters like <a href=\"https://telepathwords.research.microsoft.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Telepathwords</a> or zxcvbn take this into account and will warn you when the extra characters are predictable.</p>\n\n<h2>How Long Should Passwords Be?</h2>\n\n<p>The specifics of how long your password has to be, and how hard it is to crack, can't be answered without knowing how your password is generated, how the password is hashed on the server, and the attacker's resources. For <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/144/how-long-should-the-password-be\">more details see this question</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I'll warn you, that password policy is a matter of opinion.  I've tried to show the best solution based on research, but there are some experts who disagree with me.</p>\n",

            " <p>So IPs can in fact be considered to be PII (or personally identifiable information) in some cases, so you're right to want to consider whether you need to protect them. Generally this doesn't mean, however, going to any additional lengths beyond how you would protect other PII, say, email addresses for example.   </p>\n\n<p>In any case, traditional hashing is likely going to be an ineffective mechanism.  There are only 4 billion IP v4 addresses potentially in existence, and the reality is that you're probably dealing with a far smaller address space that that.  This means that it's relatively easy for an attacker with the hashes to compute the IP addresses that result in those hashes.  Salting is generally not useful in this case, because you presumably want to know when two requests are associated with the same IP address, and you will not be able to easily compare an existing hashes to the hash of the IP address associated with a new request if all of the hashes are uniquely salted.  </p>\n\n<p>You could, potentially use a keyed hash without a salt, using a function like HMAC.   This, presuming you can keep the key secure will lead to hashes that can be compared to each other, but also cannot be associated to the IP addresses that were used to create them by an attacker who has the hashes, but not the key.  If the key is obtained by the attacker however, this is no more secure than traditional hashing.  </p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, I'd suggest that the risk here doesn't demand the complexity of a mitigation of this level.   I think the complexity you're adding (and need to maintain) probably outweighs the additional security you'd get.   However, if for your application does in fact require you to consider IP addresses to be sensitive enough to warrant extraordinary protection, consider using a keyed hash function.  </p>\n",
            " <p>This clearly depends on the jurisdiction!\nIn Germany, IP addresses are considered personal information!\nSee e.g. <a href=\"http://rechtsanwalt-schwenke.de/die-vorratsdatenspeicherung-fuer-den-hausgebrauch-oder-darf-man-ip-adressen-der-websitebesucher-speichern/\">here</a> or <a href=\"http://www.e-recht24.de/news/datenschutz/7646-speircherung-dynamische-ip-adressen.html\">here</a> if you speak German.</p>\n\n<p>It says, basically, that you are allowed to store the IP only as long as you need it to provide the service! This means on a website, you have to delete it after you sent all IP packets to the destination (which basically means you are not allowed to log it in any usual way, only store it in the webserver memory)\nThere are exceptions e.g. for fraud prevention on e-commerce sites. But then you have to delete it after you don't need it anymore (which is after you got the money)! </p>\n\n<p>You should be fine if you remove the last block of the IP address, because then it doesn't identify a single person anymore. That's also suggested by several government related organisations as the proper way! Hashing IPv4 addresses won't work, because it is easy to calculate the IP from the hash. I don't know what is suggested for IPv6 addresses. Removing the last few bits won't work obviously, because usually one gets a /64 subnet!</p>\n\n<p>The same in <a href=\"https://www.wko.at/Content.Node/branchen/oe/sparte_iuc/Werbung-und-Marktkommunikation/Zustimmungserklaerung_fuer_Speicherung_von_Kundendaten_bei.html\">Austria</a> where you even have to <a href=\"https://www.wko.at/Content.Node/Service/Wirtschaftsrecht-und-Gewerberecht/Verwaltungs--und-Verfassungsrecht/Datenschutz/Meldeverpflichtung_beim_Datenverarbeitungsregister_DVR-Nr..html\">notify</a> a government agency that you are handling personal data!!!\nYou could in theory even get a fine if you don't register there!

And of course, Google engineers could in theory browse your files.</p>\n\n<p>As for what happens when you delete them, who knows? It is a good working assumption to consider that any data uploaded will stay on their servers forever. Realistically, I suppose it does get deleted <em>at some point</em>, but considering how much replication they must have, it may be a while. Your guess is as good as mine.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line, it is not trivial to set up off-site backups for confidential data. The only thing you can trust (or hope to trust) is cryptography.

Stealing or breaking your machine with your data then has no effect.</p>\n\n<p>If your data is not encrypted you still assume at this moment, that your data is totally secure on your disk and not accessible from the NSA. Depending on your operating system this might not even be the truth. Even if you can guarantee that your OS is free of any spyware, there is a chance that you cannot say the same for the channels through which you obtained the data.

Nobody other than Google technicians will know the answer to this question, and of those probably only the engineers who maintain the filers and the data distribution structure. </p>\n\n<p>To give you an idea of how truly \"privy\" that information is: I used to work at Yahoo as a Unix sysadmin, but I didn't work with the filer infrastructure and so even I don't know what the answer to that question would be for Yahoo data, although I spent a year working in the operations group for two of the departments there..

Nah .... the only way the NSA or somebody could access it is if they have employees working at Google. Unlikely. And even if they do, do they have root access on the servers in question? Not likely. As someone else mentioned, theoretically the government can get access through a subpoena process. But from a practical perspective do these people have willy-nilly access to John Anybody's data? Nah. </p>\n\n<p>The only people who theoretically intercept your data when you upload it are the system administrators and operations engineers who work at the companies that provide the network backbone for the internet: such as UUNet. I know for a fact these people for many years have scanned internet traffic for illegal content, because years ago when I lived in Virginia I interviewed with UUNet for a job which involved this work.

Unlike those high value targets, the Mebromi virus is designed to work against mundane PCs with the Award BIOS running the previous generation of the Windows OS.   The technology employed has been seen separately and discussed in theoretical papers.  This forum has cogitated over the theory vs. reality nature of firmware flashed attacks in the last few months relative to video card firmware persistent attacks.  Is it time to consider that debate over and declare viable, zero day, common user system APTs are here?  If so, is it not also time to reevaluate the find, patch, rinse, and repeat method of malware protection?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>I think the title to your question and the body of your question are contradicting each other a bit and I think that may be leading to some of the confusion with the other correct answers.</p>\n<p>Your title says &quot;Is it really safe&quot; but in the body of your request you're comparing passing data via stdin vs command line arguments. When you compare two things the result of the comparison only speaks to the comparison and never allows you to make an absolute claim outside of the comparison itself. For example: The number 10 is more than the number 5. So 10 is &quot;bigger&quot; than 5. But is 10 a &quot;big&quot; number when there are obviously much bigger numbers? I can't justify saying &quot;10 is a big number&quot; just because it's bigger than some other number.</p>\n<p>So: &quot;is it safe?&quot; is one question, but your question is really implying: &quot;Is it safer?&quot; with an emphasis on the extra &quot;r&quot; on &quot;safer&quot;.</p>\n<p>Just like it doesn't make sense to say that 10 is a big number when there are always bigger numbers: Nothing in information security is ever 100% &quot;safe&quot;. As you point out there are attack vectors that could allow an attacker to get at data passed via stdin. The point is that there are FAR fewer attack vectors that allow an attacker to get access to data passed via stdin. AND those vectors are more difficult to achieve.</p>\n<p>As the other answers point out: Data passed via command line arguments are visible for a long time. They are very often logged into log files as well as history files like .bash_history. These log files and history files can get backed up to the cloud, copied to other folders, disks, etc. This data is also visible to other system accounts which could potentially be compromised. In other words: An attacker has a lot of available attack vectors to gain access to command line argument data. And because of how long this data remains around for viewing, the attacker also has a larger window of time for which he can utilize to execute these attacks and still access the command line data.</p>\n<p>With stdin there are not only fewer vectors: But the attacker also has a limited time window to execute a successful attack here. He has to compromise your account specifically, or root. Both of which are more difficult than compromising one of the system accounts.  Then assuming he pulls off a successful attack to compromise your account or root: Now he can only see data being passed to stdin in real time. He can't go back and look in bash_history or log files to see data from stdin.</p>\n<p>Between the lower number of attack vectors and the timing issue: It's obvious that passing data via stdin is SAFER. And that's what matters: It's not possible for something to be 100% foolproof/safe. Everything in security is about choosing the safest possible option which minimizes the number of attack vectors or exposed &quot;surface area&quot; of points that can potentially be attacked and lead to a system becoming compromised.</p>\n<p>So: TL;DR: No, stdin is not 100% safe as nothing is. But it's far SAFER than command line arguments which is why it's preferred over using command line arguments to pass sensitive data like passwords.</p>\n",
            " <p>No. Nothing you do with a computer is 100% safe, and nothing in life is 100% safe. That's the wrong way to look at it. The question you should be asking is, which option offers <em>more</em> safety? When planning how to secure your system, you want to follow a <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">defense in depth</a></em> model: At every point while designing or configuring your system, you want to ask the question, which choice would improve my security?</p>\n<p>Is passing sensitive data via stdin safer than passing it through the command line? Yes, for all the reasons <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/a/258914/88532\">CBHacking</a> mentioned: stdin is ephemeral and requires greater <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">privilege escalation</a> to access.</p>\n<p>Can someone who has gained access to the root account (or the account running the script) via privilege escalation intercept the data sent to stdin?</p>\n<p>Absolutely. However, the command line arguments are accessible to <em>any</em> user account on your system for as long as the program is running, meaning that an attacker can choose which account they want to target, and has more opportunities to witness the sensitive data on the system.</p>\n<p>If you give the attacker a choice, you should assume they will attack the most vulnerable account available, which will probably be one that you never thought to protect.</p>\n<p>Using stdin to pass the data is not completely secure, and so that isn't the last step you should take to secure your system, if you're concerned about it. However, it is more safe than passing sensitive data on the command line.</p>\n"

But is this change of policy statement followed by retrieving Windows 10 from the market and replacing it by a new one? Of course not.</p>\n<p>Note that the last paragraph I quoted is only still available in external websites including famous newspapers by the start of this August (which thing means after Microsoft started already to sell its Windows 10), but we do not find this paragraph anymore in the updated version of the privacy policy statement anymore.

We recommend that you select <strong>Full</strong> for this\nsetting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Basic</strong> information is data that is vital to the operation of Windows.

The quoted paragraphs concern the Diagnostics Tracking Service mechanism in which other modules, apart from Telemetry, are included.</p>\n<p>Diagnostics Tracking Service consists in these files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>telemetry.asm-windowsdefault.json</li>\n<li>diagtrack.dll</li>\n<li>utc.app.json</li>\n<li>utcresources.dll</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that the answer below claiming that nothing private is collected by Windows 10 as a qualified user may listen to the traffic of his Windows operating system is wrong. It is impossible to know what Windows collects and sends permanently. Windows does not stop sending  information on his/her behalf as this study shows: Even when told not to, Windows 10 just can\u2019t stop talking to Microsoft. But still what the official documentation describes is not very good for the user such as when Windows takes <em>system files or <strong>MEMORY SNAPSHOTS</strong>, which may unintentionally include <strong>PARTS OF A DOCUMENT YOU WERE WORKING ON</strong> on when a problem occurred</em> (From: <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/98172/what-are-the-privacy-and-security-implications-of-windows-telemetry\">What are the privacy and security implications of Windows Telemetry</a>)</p>\n",
            " <p>It's worth noting that your first link is in relation to the Windows Insider program. The Windows Insider program provides you with pre-release software that does call home with usage details and other information. This is something that you agree to by installing the Windows Insider preview - if you don't like it, you don't have to install it, it's completely your choice.</p>\n\n<p>The EULA for the released version of Windows 10 doesn't include this section and there is no evidence that this information is being collected (which of course could just mean they're better at hiding it).</p>\n\n<p>The second link that you've provided is regarding the Family functionality, this is functionality that has to be enabled in order for it to work and collects application usage statistics and browsing history. In the instance linked in the article, it's perfectly possible that this functionality was enabled in Windows 8 and expanded upon when the upgrade to Windows 10 occurred. On my clean install I don't have this going on so this isn't enabled by default and has to be something that you opt into - again, when you opt into something like this you're given an agreement to agree with stating that additional information will be collected. If the information wasn't collected, functionality like this simply couldn't work.</p>\n\n<p>Windows 10 has a large number of privacy settings - many of these are on by default but they're easy enough to disable by opening up the Settings app and working your way through the Privacy settings. This covers a large variety of options from your unique advertising identifier, which is shared across various applications to allow Microsoft to track your use of the apps and show you targeted ads, to Bing search in the start menu, which will send your search queries to Microsoft Bing. This also includes many settings from older versions of Windows, such as the SmartScreen filter, which sends URLs to Microsoft for validation.</p>\n\n<p>Windows 10 also contains Cortana, with Cortana enabled, you're asking Microsoft to provide you a personal assistant and this will include sending information about your activities (including applications you run, GPS locations, browsing history) back and forth between your machine and Microsoft. This can include things like your handwriting and what your voice sounds like, but these can be disabled individually within Speech, inking &amp; typing within Privacy settings. Cortana isn't unique in this behavior. (How do you think Google Now and Siri work?)</p>\n\n<p>If you sign into Windows 10 with a Microsoft account, authentication is handled via Microsoft as well. This will also provide you with the functionality to synchronize your desktop settings, passwords, web browser settings and more between multiple devices running Windows 10. If these options are enabled then this is additional information that is synchronized to Microsoft's servers. Each of the individual sync settings can be toggled in the Settings app under Accounts > Sync your settings, or you can simply not log in with a Microsoft account and use a local account. If you're using Windows 10 Home edition, you will need to use a Microsoft account in order to enable BitLocker, and your recovery key will be uploaded to Microsoft's servers. This restriction does not apply to Windows 10 Pro or higher.</p>\n\n<p>With the \"Sample submission\" option for Windows Defender enabled, Windows Defender will send your files off to Microsoft - for example if you had some kind of confidential document with a macro in it that Windows Defender identified as a threat, with the  option enabled, this file would be submitted to Microsoft for analysis.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/even-when-told-not-to-windows-10-just-cant-stop-talking-to-microsoft/\">There are reports that even with all of the above functionality disabled some information is being passed back and forth to Microsoft</a> (Arcs Technica), and Microsoft's response on this matter is as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As part of delivering Windows 10 as a service, updates may be delivered to provide ongoing new features to Bing search, such as new visual layouts, styles and search code. No query or search usage data is sent to Microsoft, in accordance with the customer's chosen privacy settings. This also applies to searching offline for items such as apps, files and settings on the device.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><sup>It's worth noting that Arcs Technica states this statement from Microsoft is consistent with their findings</sup></p>\n\n<p>Basically, as part of the Windows Feedback and error reporting, diagnostic data is reported back to Microsoft, this can only be disabled in the Enterprise and Server editions of Windows 10 through the use of group policy editor but can only be set to a \"basic\" mode on Home and Pro editions which \"limits the amount of data sent\". This can be set in the Settings app under Feedback &amp; Diagnostics. </p>\n\n<p>Microsoft have never hidden the fact that Windows 10 is supposed to be the last major release and that future functionality will be provided as automatic updates. Any such system will require information to be passed to Microsoft to work. Ultimately, there are a lot of components in Windows that will individually and collectively synchronize their status with their online counterparts and this will result in internet traffic. </p>\n",

            " <p>As the accepted answer already states, Microsoft kept the right to collect nearly everything from users of the open beta/technical preview. Keep in mind that they cannot do everything the terms of service or the free <strong>Windows&nbsp;10 Technical Preview</strong> allow them to do, because especially in the EU privacy laws make some of this illegal. </p>\n\n<p>Before we go into the discussion that they could simply ignore the law, or their own terms of service, let's be clear what any OS maker can do if they ignore the law: They can \"forget\" to fix a security vulnerability and can make sure a third party finds and uses that vulnerability, giving the third party full access to everything. This is true for every operating system, including open source systems, because nobody can make sure the 10,000,000 lines of the Linux kernel don't contain vulnerabilities - and that doesn't even account for all the software installed on top of the kernel, which is several times more lines of code. Since this is true for all operating systems, it doesn't make sense to discuss it solely in the context of Windows&nbsp;10.</p>\n\n<p>The license agreement for the release version of Windows&nbsp;10 does not contain any of the text of the open beta/technical preview. In fact, <strong>nothing changed in terms of privacy</strong>:\n<a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-releases-new-license-terms-for-windows-10-no-surprises/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-releases-new-license-terms-for-windows-10-no-surprises/</a></p>\n\n<p>The one thing that actually changed is that if you activate Cortana, like any other personal assistant, it will link up with your calendar, email, and location, and store data related to your search queries and link it to your Microsoft account in order to synchronise across multiple devices. </p>\n"

But still what the official documentation describes is not very good for the user such as when Windows takes <em>system files or <strong>MEMORY SNAPSHOTS</strong>, which may unintentionally include <strong>PARTS OF A DOCUMENT YOU WERE WORKING ON</strong> on when a problem occurred</em> (From: <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/98172/what-are-the-privacy-and-security-implications-of-windows-telemetry\">What are the privacy and security implications of Windows Telemetry</a>)</p>\n",

Keep in mind that they cannot do everything the terms of service or the free <strong>Windows&nbsp;10 Technical Preview</strong> allow them to do, because especially in the EU privacy laws make some of this illegal. </p>\n\n<p>Before we go into the discussion that they could simply ignore the law, or their own terms of service, let's be clear what any OS maker can do if they ignore the law: They can \"forget\" to fix a security vulnerability and can make sure a third party finds and uses that vulnerability, giving the third party full access to everything. This is true for every operating system, including open source systems, because nobody can make sure the 10,000,000 lines of the Linux kernel don't contain vulnerabilities - and that doesn't even account for all the software installed on top of the kernel, which is several times more lines of code. Since this is true for all operating systems, it doesn't make sense to discuss it solely in the context of Windows&nbsp;10.</p>\n\n<p>The license agreement for the release version of Windows&nbsp;10 does not contain any of the text of the open beta/technical preview.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I'm a software developer with an interest in and basic level of knowledge about security. I've come across an authentication system that \"smells bad\" to me however I lack the expertise to know what if anything is wrong.</p>\n\n<p>The software system involves web services for downloading and uploading data from/to a database over the public internet. All communication occurs over HTTPS and a random 32 bit integer identifies the user. Requests from unknown user ids are dropped.</p>\n\n<p>Something about this seems weak but I'm not sure how weak and whether it's worth advocating change. I suppose this is equivalent to a 5 character alpha (upper/lower case) numeric password with no associated username (log62(4 billion) ~ 5) and if I look at it in those terms it seems completely anemic.</p>\n\n<p>My gut instinct about what to do for authentication would have been to expose a web service operation for \"logging in\" that takes a username/password and passes back an authentication token (for example a cryptographic hash based on the credentials and the current time) which is then good for a certain amount of time or until the user requests a log out.</p>\n\n<p>I believe my approach is more secure mainly because the credential space is dramatically larger and because the authentication token changes over time, whereas in the current system the credential space is small and the authentication token never changes. But I have no reference point... what kind of adversary would the current system fail against? What kind of adversary would my idea fail against?</p>\n\n<p>The argument in support of the current system is that we are a small player with small customers in a large world so we're not expecting to be attacked, and if we are attacked we do have some level of security. My thought is that security threats are becoming more numerous and more sophisticated pretty quickly, and we do happen to be in an industry where security is a concern. I don't want to give specifics here just because I may be pointing out the existence of a poorly secured live system, but perhaps someone knowledgeable could speak to current trends in security threats?</p>\n\n<p>I would appreciate any input on this topic, and if for some reason my question is inadequate please let me know so I can update it accordingly rather than marking it to be closed!</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

It fills an array with the time of mouse movement events in the even cells and the mouse position in the odd cells, sprinkles some magic shuffling over it (shuffling memory, xoring fields), and calls some RSA/DSA/EC* key generator with the array as argument. Whether there is serious evidence that mouse movement is a good entropy source is quite important for such use-cases. Note that this is different from using it as an <em>additional</em> source, such as in the Linux kernel, which will only increase the quality even if it's a mediocre source.</p>\n\n<p>I have a hard time believing nobody ever looked into this.

            " <p>Consider this a very, very, very short description. The answer to your question can encompass an entire set of books.</p>\n\n<p>Security is about risk management. Making something secure is about lowering risk. The lowering of risk goes together with putting controls into place, each control may have a certain price and can mitigate a certain risk, by lowering the likelihood a vulnerability can have a negative impact on your assets. Assets in this context can be anything a company considers valuable, this includes systems, applications, but also people, infrastructure etc...</p>\n\n<p>A and B are both valid, except A would probably depend on cost. Security costs money and it doesn't make sense to spend loads of money to secure an asset if the security costs more than the asset is worth. If the value of an asset increases over time it may make sense to \"make it more secure\" over time by spending more on extra controls.</p>\n",
            " <p>Both are applicable.</p>\n\n<p>Securing something means reducing the risks associated with running such a network, system or application.</p>\n\n<p>In information security the risks are often in the CIA triad - Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. For example, an application may have a security vulnerability that affects the confidentiality of data. Securing the application against this risk would involve remediating the security vulnerability or removing the threat. However, it is not usually possible to achieve the latter. It may not be practical to make this vulnerability \"as secure as possible\", however the risk can be mitigated to a level that is acceptable by the business, so often the action that is taken is to make it \"more secure\".</p>\n",
            " <p>Security usually refers to secure sharing, meaning techniques of sharing certain information only with the people you want to share it with.  If you do not have anything to share, then it is easy to be secure, just do not give anyone any information about yourself.  However, that approach is quite impractical, as living and doing business require sharing certain information: financial information with business partners, medical information with doctors, identification information with business partners and government, personal information with friends and family, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Usually when people talk about a 'lack of security' they are referring to a demonstrated vulnerability and usually a sever vulnerability.  In some sense, hackers, cons, fraudsters, and thieves are always testing your security, both electronic and physical.  Most of the time you, your computers, and your life are okay, you loose no information to the wrong person, and we call this 'secure'.  At other times, there is a problem, such as a break and entry in your home, or perhaps a data breach on your computer.  In this case we call this a security problem.</p>\n\n<p>The process of recovering a secure situation after a breach involves risk analysis and vulnerability repair.  If you are interested in legal action, then forensics comes into play.  Fixing the security holes is fundamentally different than getting justice which involves law enforcement.  Most computer security professionals focus on fixing security holes first, and forensics second.  Although, during the vulnerability analysis phase, there is a certain amount of forensics used to discover the vulnerability, but usually it does not pass the standard used in a court of law.</p>\n",
            " <p>In terms of cryptography, <strong>secure means not broken</strong>. And <strong>broken</strong> means, there is a <strong>method to decrypt better than brute force</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>And as you know, brute force is the method of desperation where you need to try all possible keys. </p>\n",
            " <p>Risk management is the key to answering this deceptively simple question. To make data (or a device) perfectly secure, one would have to erase all knowledge of it. Destroying the data/device to make it secure makes it unavailable, violating the CIA triad cited by @SilverlightFox. By using the Enigma encryption device, the Nazi made it vulnerable. </p>\n\n<p>As long as the future (and life) is uncertain, \"as secure as possible\" is a never ending and fruitless task. So making something more secure is more to the issue of securing something. However, that raises the question: how much more secure does the data (device) need to be? How much more effort and ingenuity is appropriate to \"secure the asset?\" </p>\n\n<p>This reminds me of the following joke:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Two men are walking through a forest.  Suddenly, they see a bear\n  running towards them.  They turn and start running away.  But then one\n  of them stops, takes some running shoes from his bag, and starts\n  putting the on.\n          \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d says the other man.  \u201cDo you think you will run fast than the bear with those?\u201d\n          \u201cI don\u2019t have to run faster than the bear,\u201d he says.  \u201cI just have to run faster than you.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So \"how much security is enough\" depends on the context. That's why most homes have key locks and banks go to the trouble of installing vaults. The impact of a breach on the former - though quite personal to the homeowner - is likely less costly in total that the impact to the bank. Thanks to the measures banks take to protect the contents of their vaults (steel, alarms, guards, etc), homeowners pay banks to hold their valuables in a lock box rather than replicate the bank's security measures for their homes. The exception that proves the point is the visibly wealthy homeowner who declines to put all her valuables into the bank vault. What is the point of valuable paintings, sculpture, and jewelry if you can't enjoy it?</p>\n\n<p>So how does one decide how much effort or money spent on security is enough? One tool is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annualized_loss_expectancy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Annualized loss expectancy</a>. In short, ALE is the cost (tangible and intangible) of a loss times the probability that incident will occur in a year. If the bank has $10,000 in the vault and there is a 10 percent chance of getting successfully robbed, the bank should no more (or less) than $1,000 to protect the vault. <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/09/security_roi_1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bruce Schneier</a> points out that the calculation get complicated and messy very quickly. </p>\n\n<p>Another approach is return on security investment (ROSI). Mirroring the business principle of return on investment, <a href=\"http://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/2967\" rel=\"nofollow\">The cost of a bad thing happening is called risk exposure. A security solution mitigates that risk by some percentage. Multiplying the exposure by the percentage mitigated gives the expected return.</a> Thus ROSI is used to identify the appropriate expenditure on securing an asset. However ROSI is not without its detractors, notable among them <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/09/security_roi_1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bruce Schneier</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Andrew Jauquith's <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321349989\" rel=\"nofollow\">Security Metrics</a> is another worthy read on the subject. Jaquith writes on p 33 \"...practitioners of ALE suffer from a near-complete inability to reliably estimate probabilities [of occurrence] or losses.\" You can read his clear and cogent alternatives to ALE and ROI. </p>\n"

SharePoint over here can host the aspx pages holding your application and nothing more. It will give you the publishing infrastructure for easier management.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to design the complete solution using SharePoint, you need to identify the possible corners of SharePoint Object Model and how they can fit into your requirement. Like for instance you can use the list driven infrastructure to store information of the buildings and use CAML + c# in your webpart to show building details on highlight. For search you can use allow items in the list to be crawled by the SharePoint search and leverage Search based classes provided by SharePoint on your search webparts. </p>\n\n<p>It all depends on how you can leverage SharePoint to address your application's requirement more efficiently than writing every classes and namespaces from scratch. </p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Environment: SP2010 Enterprise, VS2012</p>\n\n<p>I've been using C# to programmatically create alerts for various users and implementing the alert.Filter property to assign filters that point to specific directories. It's simple enough to create a variable for the path to insert into the filter, but when it comes to the username, passing a variable in its place does not seem to work using any method I have tried. CAML (or at least the pseudo-CAML used in filters) likes the user's name to actually be the name <strong>field</strong> (in this case, pulled from AD) not the <strong>account</strong> name. So after a little playing around I figured out how to turn that into a variable to pass into the filter like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>string userName = vUser.Name;\nstring oFilter = (\"&lt;Query&gt;&lt;And&gt;&lt;Or&gt;&lt;Eq&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='ItemFullUrl'/&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + fullPath + \"&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Eq&gt;&lt;BeginsWith&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='ItemFullUrl'/&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + fullPath + \"/&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/BeginsWith&gt;&lt;/Or&gt;&lt;Neq&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + userName + \"&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='Editor/New'/&gt;&lt;/Neq&gt;&lt;/And&gt;&lt;/Query&gt;)\");\noAlert.Filter = oFilter;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The user.Name property outputs a name that matches the format in the CAML filter of a working alert I examined. If I type the name directly into the filter it works fine, but when I try to pass it as a variable it breaks, even if I explicitly set the variable to \"User Name\".</p>\n\n<p>Is there some part of how the filter/string works that I'm not accounting for? Every search I've done online has said this method should work, in theory. My goal is simply to make the alert apply only to changes made by other users, is there perhaps another way to accomplish that?</p>\n\n<p>Any advice is greatly appreciated!</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>For driving SP 2013 with only 12 GB of RAM I recommend that you <a href=\"http://www.gknzcfc.net/subsite/continuous-crawl-on-sharepoint-2013.html\">stop</a> the search from doing continous crawls, and to stop any services that you do not plan to use. Otherwise you will ned a bit more memory.</p>\n\n<p>The search continous crawl uses a massive amount of system resources, so in a low performance environment, it should be turned of if it is not extremely necessary for your purposes. </p>\n\n<p>Also make sure that the virtual machine is allowed to use more than one processor core in your VM environment settings (This got me once in Hyper-V)</p>\n",

            " <p>If you like to tune up the latency, I may recommend couple things.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Since SQL 2008, SQL supports 64 KB formatted partitions. If you may keep the database in a partition which is formatted as 64 KB, that will increase SharePoint 2013 performance directly.</p></li>\n<li><p>On the hand, as default SQL databases increases size by 2 MB each time when needed. You can fix this number for certain amount, database will stop to increase the database size time to time to grow.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>With only these two things there is a chance you may increase your SharePoint experience up to %30.</p>\n",

            " <p>For the record, i will add a fast resume of (mostly) all the tips to fine tune SharePoint 2013 for use in a low resource machine (i.e. developer machine or testing machine).  Its not a how-to answer but it could leads to solve some problem</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Installing the root certificate, disable the clr check or send clr.microsoft.com to the 127.0.0.1. It speed ups the \"awake\" of the websites. Sometimes considerably. Its also a must have trick for SharePoint 2010.</li>\n<li>Configure Noderunner to use less memory. Noderunner is configure to use so much memory and it spans over 4 process, each one consuming usually between 300mb-600mb (in total 600x4 = 1.4gb), each one consuming a lot of memory. It could be disable to 256mb or even 128mb.</li>\n<li>Disable distributed cache.</li>\n<li>Configure the search service. By default, its configure to about to collect information every minute and its overkill for most system (even for a 24gb machine).   While its possible to disable it but i suggest to configure it correctly to run every hour or every day.</li>\n<li>Timer Service. If you are updating then, disabling it could speed up the process. </li>\n<li>Disable the service that you don't want to use.</li>\n<li>A proper configuration of SharePoint involves a farm of several machines. Specially the database should be installed in a different machine.   However, a dev/testing machine usually includes domain + sql server + sharepoint in the same box.</li>\n<li>Disable Health and Usage Service.</li>\n<li>Update SharePoint 2013.  Don't forget to also update the database.</li>\n<li>Lastly : SharePoint 2010 is way more resource friendly. <em>wink</em> <em>wink</em> ;-)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Optionally:</p>\n\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li>Configure Sql Server to use another partition/disk. Also you can configure sql server to limit the memory used (usually its configured to use over 2 trillions of bytes).</li>\n<li>In some cases, Sharepoint 2013 Online is quite inexpensive. Its not blazing fast but its usable.  It costs about $8 per user per month.</li>\n</ol>\n",
            " <p>For me, reprovisioning the distributed cache service resolved the performance issue:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$serviceInstance. = Get-SPServiceInstance | Where { $_.TypeName -like \"Distributed Cache\"}\n$serviceInstance.Unprovision()\n$serviceInstance.Provision()\n</code></pre>\n",

Behind the scenes there will be some\nportal features, such as personalised dashboards and a collaborative wiki.</p>\n\n<p>For the public-facing content, the site structure is as so:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Home</li>\n<li>Company\n<ul>\n<li>About Us</li>\n<li>Testimonials</li>\n<li>...</li>\n<li>...</li>\n<li>etc</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Products \n<ul>\n<li>Product 1</li>\n<li>Product 2</li>\n<li>...</li>\n<li>...</li>\n<li>etc</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Support\n<ul>\n<li>a support section for customers requiring a login</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Contact Us\n<ul>\n<li>one web page with contact details</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The top-level sections in my hierarchy, i.e. Home, Company, Products, Support, Contact Us would share the same master page and top-level navigation, and Company and Products will each have a left-placed submenu to go to each page in their section.  I'm wondering how to structure this in terms of sites/subsites/site collections.</p>\n\n<p>My initial thoughts is to have a site collection where the top-level site for\nthe collection is the public-facing publishing side of things.  </p>\n\n<p>But then I'm not sure whether 'Company' and 'Products' should be subsites of the \ntop-level publishing site, or simply pages within the top-level publishing site.\nAs Company and Products are just collections of basic HTML content, to have each one as a 'subsite' feels like overkill, but that may just be because I'm\nnot used to the terminology.  I would ordinarily just think of them as subsections of a website.</p>\n\n<p>The 'Support' section is essentially a set of embedded mini-applications such\nas issue tracking.  As it is more substantial, and is not viewable by anonymous users, it feels like it would warrant being at least a subsite, or maybe it should be a separate site collection?</p>\n\n<p>I would guess that the 'behind-the-scenes' portal, only accessible by employees, with features such as dashboards/collaborative wiki, would again be in a separate site collection.</p>\n\n<p>I guess my general question is, <strong>what are the rules of thumb for when to use a site, when to use a subsite, and when to use a site collection</strong>?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

Let's say we need:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>a search box web part</li>\n<li>search result web part</li>\n<li>a filter web part</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All built by us in SPFx. All placed on one page.</p>\n\n<p>The user types a search query into the search box - the search result web part and the filter web part should update while typing. The user clicks a value in the filter web part - the search result web part should update. And so on. Highly interactive.</p>\n\n<p>And this is just one example, you could imagine other complex, modular UIs.</p>\n\n<p>The user is free to place any of these web parts on any page (modern and classic). He could leave the filter web part out and just place the search box and search result web part and it should work. If he omits a critical web part the other web parts should detect this and show a hint.</p>\n\n<p>So the web parts \"know\" each other and bind their UI to a shared state. User interaction in one web part triggers actions in other web parts.</p>\n\n<p>How would you approach this in the most SPFx-compatible manner? I think I could always use a shared data blob somewhere and somehow bind to that (how?). But is this the way? What are the alternatives?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

Otherwise, you'll get a scary error saying it can't serialize the properties.</p>\n\n<p>For example, my dynamicDataConsumer web part expects a dynamic property called <code>contributor</code>, which is an <code>object</code>. In my <a href=\"https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-fx-webparts/blob/master/samples/react-chartcontrol/src/webparts/dynamicDataConsumer/DynamicDataConsumerWebPart.manifest.json\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">web part manifest</a>, I define it as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code> \"properties\": {\n      \"contributor\": {}\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I hope this helps?</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>My question is about how best to organize C++ classes around a database\nmodel, and I understand this may appear very elementary.</p>\n\n<p>The software I propose to create will do the following. It is intended for\nsmall FMCG manufacturers and will use Qt.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The software will record non-conformance's, product complaints,\ncorrective actions and serve as an electronic record keeping</li>\n<li>There will be quite a bit of 'business logic', as the standout\nfeature is intended to be comprehensive reporting, searching and\nanalysis, as well as a flexible approach to entering data to smooth\nworkflows (ie, a break away from the \"one screen per process stage\"\nparadigm)</li>\n<li>The persistent store is an SQL database, with a table(s) for each\ntype of record (some records will be broken into separate tables for\ninvestigations/solutions. This means that most work will be done on a\nsingle row).</li>\n<li>Each customer who uses this software will require amendments,\nadditional columns/fields or changes in column names and maybe\nbusiness logic. Each customer may require updates which change the\ndatabase structure. The idea is that anything that can be customized, any\nclient specific requirements will live within these classes.</li>\n<li>There will be reporting, mainly involving pulling records matching\nparticular categories, word searches, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have the database schema done and laid out, and the logic of how tables\nrelate is clear.  I have used this very schema in another framework, but a web based app doesn't seem to offer the level of power to the user with regards to the GUI, which is essential to differentiate this product from the others.</p>\n\n<p>My question is how to design classes around the database. It is important to\nget this right, so that the architecture of the software doesn't have to be\nredesigned later on. The classes will not be responsible for the persistent\nstore, only for acting as an intermediary between the layer responsible for\nthe persistent store and the controllers/views.</p>\n\n<p>The most logical approach appears to be to have a class for non-conformances/complaints etc, which solely store the instance (ie, one object per non-conformance record), validate data and class specific business logic (ie, computations).  One class per table seems logical in this case.  What I'm struggling with, is whether it is standard practice to simply have data members for each column, define getters and setters, or whether I should create a class which isn't hard-coded to map to a table, but which populates a map based on the database schema or external file which defines the database and column properties. The former means that the coding for the class needs to be changed when columns are modified, the latter potentially not.  Keep in mind, for the majority of the time, each user will be working with one record at at time.</p>\n\n<p>In short, I can see example of how to do SQL queries, but I've struggled to\nfind anything which shows me what the class should look like (or if this entire approach is wrong) and I'd like to compare what I'm doing, with what the industry would define as good practice (I'm not a programmer by trade).</p>\n\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>The first question is if you are okay with having to recompile the program every time the database schema changes. I'm not quite clear on your situation but for example:</p>\n\n<p>You have a number of clients with slightly different needs (ie A needs to track Properties X, Y, Z, but B also needs to track Property W) but for a given client those needs are pretty constant. And you can work with and deploy a custom application to each client (aka you aren't selling this off the self). In that case, have a template that you can then inherit from and modify on a per client basis might be a pretty good business strategy, if the total number of clients is not high enough to make it worth creating a highly adaptable application right from the start. Having 5 different versions of the program is still maintainable, 100 is not.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you have 100 clients you simply cannot be changing the code every time one of them wants to add a property (column) to something. Or even add a new type of object. So the program will need to be more dynamic, probably working off a relational map that is saved somewhere and that can be edited by the program as needed.</p>\n\n<p>So lets assume what you have is more like the former. Having classes that represent the types of records you have is a good way to do it. Those classes can contain SQL queries directly. You should still however have things like table names as constants defined in a common .h file and then call them as constants in your actual code so any change needs to be made in only one place. Then if you need a slightly different object for a different client, you can inherit the classes you already have and make the necessary changes.</p>\n\n<p>You could also put together an intermediary class that handles actual database interactions, so if you change the schema or even the type of database you are using, you just need to switch out or modify that class.</p>\n",

It should be noted though that some people consider the EAV model as an anti-pattern because it will cause some additional complexities.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I'm guessing that all records will still have some shared subset of core attributes that are same for all customers. To me the cleanest approach would be to separate this core part from customer specific extensions altogether. The core attributes I would keep as data members in your C++ classes for ease of use and design a separate mechanism for the extensions. Also, if you decide to use something in the likes of the EAV model, I would still keep these core attributes in dedicated columns instead of splitting them to their own rows. </p>\n",

            " <p>The common mistake many people make with database mapping is that they focus on the schema and develop a tightly-coupled representation of the tables in business logic classes. This is not the best way at all - obviously it makes the business logic layer so tightly coupled to the DB that they quickly realise its a mistake and end up adding another layer to try to decouple business logic from DB, calling it a DAO or ORM or similar.</p>\n\n<p>What you should do is look at your DB as a layer in itself, one that provides an API where data requests are made. I find its easiest to conceptualise this by writing all your SQL as stored procedures and restricting all access to the underlying tables. (this approach also has the benefit of increasing security)</p>\n\n<p>Once you do this, you start to look at the data as a resource to be consumed, the business logic will have classes written that map to the stored procedures and they work together - logic in the business logic classes with data that is operated on sourced from your \"data API\". It also means you can change the schema without any change to the business logic layer at all (though, obviously if you change the stored proc API that is used, you'll have to change the callers, but you can add new sprocs where needed without any impact on existing code).</p>\n\n<p>Another benefit is that your DB and your business logic are then independent and can be worked on separately. using your DB API would be not much different than using a 3rd party API provided via a web service or other data source. </p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I apologize if this is a little vague, but I'm curious about what most people use for naming conventions for classes that access a webservice.  Typically on my team we create separate projects for BLL (business rules), Model (DTOs and ASP.NET model classes), and Data ( typically Db and WS I/O ).</p>\n\n<p>My question is in regards to what teams do for classes that access services.  Typically in our Data project we postpend 'Dao' to the class name that queries the objects in the Db.  So for example a class that does CRUD operations in a Db on Foo objects we typically name FooDao.cs and there seems to be general consensus on the team for that pattern.  But what do teams do for classes that query webservices?  Sometimes we name them as FooFacade.cs, or FooSvcClient, or even FooSvc.  </p>\n\n<p>I understand there probably isn't a true right or wrong answer here, but I want to know what others do, and if there is momentum towards a particular approach. </p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

You can make that moniker as descriptive as you like: <code>JsonWebServiceClient</code>, for example.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, I think it would be useful if the class name also included the name of the type being retrieved, or a description of the operation being performed.  So, for example, if you were retrieving a Customer object from a json web service, your class name might be</p>\n\n<pre><code>CustomerClient\nCustomerWebServiceClient\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or even</p>\n\n<pre><code>CustomerXmlWebServiceClient\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To add some weight to these assertions, here is an example from <code>ServiceStack.Client</code>, a library that allows you to write generic clients against XML and JSON web services:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/reCbg.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/reCbg.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Notice how the name of the client class is <code>XmlServiceClient</code>, and the <code>Post</code> method accepts the expected return type as a parameter.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever you do decide, make sure that the naming convention you settle upon is agreed upon by the team and then strictly followed.

It allows the caller to access the service without worrying about creating an HttpClient or WebClient or anything transport-related.</p>\n\n<p>A client on the other hand is more likely to contain a bit more value-added logic to make the service easier to use.

Even presuming that what you mean by systems comprises solely of software.</p>\n\n<p>But before I go into the meat of it, I don't know of a book to help. All that which follows, I learnt from experience (meaning the three points that William made).</p>\n\n<p>What you are talking about spans at a minimum four broad roles. Sometimes one person might fill in all those roles, for small to medium sized projects, but when you start on large projects you need to at least somewhat separate those roles out. It is difficult for anyone to be expert at them all in any meaningful way.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Business analyst</p>\n\n<p>That's the person who talks to the customer and translates their requirements into something an architect can make sense of. Basically a list of properly formulated requirements. This includes the obvious functional requirements (what must this system deliver?), but also non-functional requirements (what are the general characteristics that the system must fulfil? This may include security, reliability, availability, resilience, capacity, performance, robustness and other such requirements from a user point of view).</p>\n\n<p>This is the first pass at what the system must do, the very start of serious thinking.</p></li>\n<li><p>System architect</p>\n\n<p>This person produces the high level technical framework within which to work. They give the outline match plan. The general tools, techniques, constructs. They break down the whole system into smaller components, how they fit with one another, how they fit with the outside world...</p>\n\n<p>This helps in many ways refine what needs to be thought about. Very often problems will be discovered at that stage about the requirements as written by the business analyst. Back to them for some iterations to improve their understanding of what they want and their expression of it.</p></li>\n<li><p>System designer</p>\n\n<p>This role is about how to make it all work. This might be more team work than a one-man show. But there is likely a lead designer to oversee the whole system design. This person must dig into the detail and make sure the architect's view is something that can actually be built.</p>\n\n<p>Expect further refining of the architecture of the system, and therefore potentially of the business analysis.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tests manager</p>\n\n<p>This role is very often forgotten. But at the end of the day if you can't test it, how can you prove that you can build it? There must be a review of the results of all stages : business analysis, architecture and design by someone competent in testing who will be able to highlight deficiencies and therefore enable early corrections, way before any code gets written.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That's a short summary.</p>\n\n<p>Those guys/gals are only the general run of the mill people in the chain to think about what must be thought about.</p>\n\n<p>For complex projects such as large banking or space applications just to take two examples (think many hundreds to many thousands of man-days), there are many subject matter experts as we call them to review and support projects at every stage. These roles include security analysis, system sizing, capacity, performance, databases, clustering, and many other such narrow areas of expertise, including precise business areas. The variety of roles depends on the size and complexity of systems.</p>\n\n<p>All that to say that you should not try and know it all, you won't. You can however get a grasp of the overall picture and on small projects you can delve into much more than on large projects, simply because the level of complexity allows you to be more rounded.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to know how to design systems, then you need to start asking questions by thinking outside the box. Put yourself enough in the customer's shoes and try and think what could go wrong, what needs testing. Then get together with a real customer and push them to explain the extents and limits of the system they envision they need. Plus whenever I say 'customer', you must understand that this encompasses several very different people. There's the person who uses the system day in day out for what it was designed to do. There's the operator, technical support, the manager who needs some report or other, the auditor, the infrastructure team, the stakeholder who paid for it, the quality manager who needs means to test your system... Ask all of them (and if they are one person, ask them to put all these hats on one at a time), so ask them all what they need and you will have a good start at knowing what your system requirements are. From there you can derive the architecture, and from there the design.</p>\n\n<p>For complex systems (whether software only or to integrate with hardware in the most generic sense) not only is one person not enough for each of the four roles I listed above, but you need to project-manage even the definition of what the system must do, let alone the other phases.</p>\n\n<p>HPH,\nasm.</p>\n",
            " <p>The best way to learn how to do anything is to do it. If you want to learn how to speak French, you have to speak French, and read French and write French and read about French and go to France and talk to French people in French. If you want to know how to play the piano, you have to actually play the piano. You have to play simple songs and learn the structure of the piano, and the structure of music. You have to learn how to read music, and how to express music through a piano using your fingers. You have to learn what music sounds like and what kinds of sounds a piano can make versus what a guitar or a flute or a saxophone can do. </p>\n\n<p>Programming is exactly the same. If you to know how to design a database, you have to design databases. If you want to understand cryptography, implement cryptographic algorithms and cryptographic protocols. If you want to write software that can serve multiple users simultaneously you have to understand how disk IO, network IO and threads work. To understand how that works you have write code that reads and writes from files, transmits data across a network, and synchronizes access to resources. All of that requires practice.</p>\n\n<p>A \"system\" is, generally, just a collection of stuff. Pieces that coordinate to form a whole. To build something big, you have to build a bunch of small parts. So, if you want to learn how to build systems, just start building systems. Take a problem, break down into pieces, and implement each piece one by one. Eventually you'll have an integrated \"system\". You'll probably fail a few times along the way, but that's ok. If you aren't failing it usually means you aren't trying hard enough.</p>\n\n<p>Also,  I would recommend going to school to study Computer Science. That won't help too much with the \"practice\" part. You'll have to do that on your own, but it will help with the exposure part. You'll learn a lot, about pretty much everything related to how computers, and computer systems work, which is hard to learn on your own.</p>\n"

Your application has huge amount of users, so there is no way to be certain that it will make it faster.</p></li>\n<li><p>Well, yes, Node.js does in fact consume fewer server resources. So not only can you save money on resources, but you can also do more with the existing ones. This is mostly because of single-threaded nature of Node.js. There is no overhead of additional threads.</p></li>\n<li><p>Again Node.js is not magic. Having said that, there might be some truth in that. Node.js has a very active community that has created hundreds of modules for every possible task. So it is quite probable that most of the work has been done for you. You just need to fit the pieces together.</p></li>\n<li><p>Theoretically, yes. Since Node.js is JavaScript, you can share code between the client and server. But I don't know exactly what it is that will be shared. I have not written any piece of code that was reusable on a client. Things that we do on the server usually has nothing to do with the client. More important to me is the lack of context switch. I find it easier to code on both client and server in a single language.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Since Node.js is single-threaded, unless <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">explicitly configured</a> to do so, it can't take advantage of multiple <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit\" rel=\"nofollow\">CPUs</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Take a look at the comments too.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I've been programming for a few years, and have become very familiar with C# and JavaScript over time. I have some larger C# and JavaScript projects that I have no trouble navigating around. I recently started a PHP &amp; AngularJS project for work with no prior experience with PHP.</p>\n\n<p>The flow of the PHP side of things is becoming hard to keep track of (The JavaScript side is larger, but easy to work through), when I try and think through it I imagine a tangled ball of thread. Major design mistakes that I made when I started are beginning to pile up and effect my design going forward. It takes longer and longer to implement anything new.</p>\n\n<p>I'm on a tight deadline and finding it harder and harder to write good, DRY, SOLID, code. It's becoming more enticing to copy/paste chunks of code to make slight variations to it's behavior as design time goes up. It's also taking a long time to get back into the code base whenever I have to do a context switch (From one project then back to this one), I have a feeling of dread whenever I go back to work on this project.</p>\n\n<p>What steps can I take to remedy this? The extra time it might take needs to be justifiable as well, my boss is not a developer and is not familiar with development or software life cycles so explaining might be more difficult than normal.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>If we're just talking about pure performance and tossing aside all notions of productivity and maintainability, then it's hard to beat a <code>switch</code> statement with compile-time constants for case expressions.</p>\n\n<p>It's potentially even faster than a jump table, at least on the C++ side (I imagine C# optimizers are pretty smart too). I was surprised one time looking through some disassembly in Godbolt for a <code>switch</code> statement like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>switch (opcode)\n{\ncase 0x01:\n    call_some_function_which_calls_other_functions(...);\n    break;\ncase 0x2:\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Only to get a moment where I was extremely confused. Where's the jump table? Then the confusion was followed by a moment of awe. Instead of using a jump table, the optimizer actually figured out that the entire <code>switch</code> and nest of function calls can boil down to a simple LUT. It turned the analogical equivalent above to something completely branchless like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>data = some_other_data[opcode];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And I was so impressed because I never even conceived that that whole mess of <code>switch</code> statements and nested function calls with parameters being passed could boil down to a simple assignment from a look-up table of data. I then looked through all the code and function calls and realized, \"Hey, actually you could just use a LUT here.\" So what an optimizer can do with some <code>switch</code> statements and nested function calls which it knows ahead at compile-time is pretty amazing.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't been quite as amazed yet when dynamic dispatch is involved. I've never seen disassembly of a kind that suggested an optimizer could inline a function call involving virtual dispatch supplied only a base pointer/reference or function pointer which it'd have to do first before it can do all its wizardry with things like register allocation and instruction selection. If C optimizers could do this, then <code>qsort</code> would rival C++'s <code>std::sort</code> instead of typically taking twice as long or longer (<code>qsort's</code> only conceptual disadvantage is its use of dynamic dispatch on the comparator). Nevertheless, polymorphism often yields code that's so much easier to maintain and looks so much nicer.</p>\n\n<p>Also while it is kinda gross, there can actually be cases where you need to branch off 100+ different conditions in a real-world scenario. A prime example I've looked at is an emulator which has to deal with a boatload of opcodes for the target hardware which supported an instruction set that contained 100 instructions or more.</p>\n\n<p>So I generally think whatever you do, you have to provide the optimizer with as much information it can know in advance at compile-time as possible. The <code>switch</code> statement achieves that. Not all optimizers are so smart at figuring out in advance where a function call involving dynamic dispatch (virtual function, function pointer, etc) will ultimately lead to at compile-time.</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>So I've worked in many different workplaces as a developer and my level of access to the database has been varied. I typically don't have production db access. </p>\n\n<p>Most of the time I have access to the test database, but it varies. Sometimes I can do and change database and data as I please, but usually there are other arrangements. Like I may only have read access to the data.</p>\n\n<p>I worked in one place where a DBA team would manage the databases, we couldn't make changes at all unless we submitted a form with the sql script for them to \"inspect\". They typically didn't have much to do with the project itself so most of the time, it was just to press F5.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, I can understand why prod needs to be locked down but I prefer to have as much database access in the dev and test environments. I think most devs are reasonably capable of knowing their way around a database. But I would like to hear opinions though? How much database access should developers have? Can we be trusted to not break anything up there?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>The absolute minimum you need to get the job done.</p>\n\n<p>If all developers are given full DB access, the chance of one getting angry (or drunk, or extremely tired or...) and doing serious damage is much higher then if they can only read from a database.</p>\n\n<p>If your job can mostly be done without DB write access (And by mostly I mean at most a few change requests a week), then you really don't need write access.</p>\n",
            " <p>There are 2 competing desires in all work environment.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The desire to give people access so they can solve problems on their own.  This allows them to be fast and self service.</li>\n<li>The desire to limit and control access to prevent damage, down time or loss of data (intentional or otherwise).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Part of what shapes the balance that is struck (or should anyway) is the expectation set for the developers.  In every job I've had where developers had access to everything the expectation was for them to limit themselves.  Only access the system if you know what you're doing.  That meant you knew what you were doing from both a developer and sysadmin standpoint.  If you weren't sure in either area you had no business accessing the systems without someone who did to chaperon you.</p>\n\n<p>To sum up if you don't know, <strong>you shouldn't have access to any system other than easily re-buildable dev systems</strong>.  If you do know, than you know <strong>you shouldn't be accessing any system except your easily re-buildable dev systems</strong>.</p>\n",
            " <p>Usually (that's means there is the luxury to setup a full environment), the developer access to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Production server\n<ul>\n<li>None (SA/PM will apply for schema setup, end user will provide init data)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>UAT server\n<ul>\n<li>None (SA/PM will apply for schema setup and sample data seeding)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Testing/QA server\n<ul>\n<li>Usually developer will send schema setup script to QA team and QA creates the tables</li>\n<li>Developers have full access to databases but seldom alter it </li>\n<li>Developers may help QA colleagues to seed/patch/delete some data</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Development server/localhost\n<ul>\n<li>Full access</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The main reason behind why developers should not touch production servers is: when anything goes wrong, the operation team is responsible, but not the developers. </p>\n",
            " <p>Developers should have full access to dev databases (ideally they should be running a local server, but that's not always possible).  They should have access to the build/QA database, but only to the data (should have to get permission/submit a ticket to change the structure).  Developers should never have casual access to the production database (unless it's a small company/project and developers also do production support).</p>\n",
            " <p>I think the key here is what responsibility level the developers have.  In a large organization with lots of developers, they will likely only have access to development with read only access to QA/Test.  </p>\n\n<p>However, there should be people on the development team with full access to all environments.  This is usually the person responsible for making fixes etc.  While this is somewhat risky it's a tradeoff between how much you trust the developer, how quickly you want things fixed, and the risks involved in messing up the system or disclosure of information in the system.</p>\n\n<p>I worked in a large IT shop and we did have read access to production for most people.  I as the lead developer also had permissions to the production database.  I still had to follow the same guidelines as the sysadmins and DBAs in terms of process and paperwork, but I could also make an urgent fix if needed.</p>\n",

Nothing should be going to prod that is not part of an official release. All too many times, people do a quick fix on prod that either doesn't work, causing prod to be even more mucked up or works but they forget to put the code into the dev/QA/Staging servers and even worse into the source control repository and the code gets overwritten about a month later in the next offical release. </p>\n\n<p>I prefer devs to have full database QA rights because deploying to another server helps them see if there are any gaps in their deployment process (oops forgot that I changed that table in order to do thus and such and oops I forgot that I did that change using the GUI and not in a script in source control which is how any database structural changes need to happen). </p>\n\n<p>When you have a new Enterprise-type client who will have their own set of servers, permissions may be eased before going live.

You also lose those \"oops I deleted the whole user table by accident because I forgot to hightlight a where clause\" type of accidents when prod deployments are purely using scripts that are run as a whole not one command at a time as is typical when devs run things on prod.

With enough will (be it criminal or for good) they will get the needed access.</p>\n\n<p>Who can hold them back from putting a simple SQL editor into the application? This way they can use the database with the privileges of the application. In most cases this is all that is needed. When the database is configured securely, they might not have the privilege to create or delete objects, but they have at least read and write access to the data.</p>\n\n<p>I already here the ops people cry. But be honest to yourself, you are not in complete control of the application deployed in production, unless you write it yourself (and not even then, think about libraries).

    "\n\nHuman: <p>This came out of some of the answers and comments on another question (<a href=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/22552/software-on-budget-and-on-time/22558#22558\">this one</a>).</p>\n\n<p>I've worked primarily with waterfall projects and while I've worked on ad-hoc projects that have taken on agile behaviours and have read a fair bit about agile, I'd say I've never worked on a \"proper\" agile project.</p>\n\n<p>My question is does the concept of \"late\" have any meaning in agile, if so then what?</p>\n\n<p>My reasoning is that with agile you have no upfront plan and you have no detailed requirements at the outset.  You may have a high level goal in mind and a notional date attached to it but both may change (potentially massively) and neither are certain.</p>\n\n<p>So if you don't know exactly what you're going to deliver basically until you deliver it and the user accepts it, and if you don't have a schedule beyond the next sprint, how could you ever be late in any way that actually has meaning?</p>\n\n<p>(Obviously I understand that a sprint might overrun but I'm talking about beyond that.)</p>\n\n<p>Just to be clear I'm (personally) happy with the assumption that on time waterfall projects (even relatively large ones) are possible based on the fact I've seen them and been involved in them - they're not easy or common even but they are possible.  </p>\n\n<p>This isn't about knocking agile, it's about me understanding it.  I've always seen the benefit of agile as nothing to do with deadlines or budgets (or rather only indirectly), it's to do with scope - agile delivers closer to what is really important rather than what the project team think is important before they've seen anything.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p><strong>I disagree that an Agile project has no upfront plan.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>My experience is that the business analysts have spent a fair amount of time working in design meetings with customers and developers to come up with a detailed list of achievable requirements that are presented as user stories. These are then broken down into tasks with suitable estimates attached by experienced developers.</p>\n\n<p>Once the most important tasks have been identified at the start of the sprint/iteration then coding can begin. This selection process determines the meaning of the iteration in the overall project (\"We're building the login process\"). Various memebers of the team get on with the various tasks necessary to make that user story happen. </p>\n\n<p>At the end of the iteration all the user stories for that iteration should be complete, <strong>or you're late</strong>. Equally, development should be able to stop at the end of each iteration and the product released. It may not be complete in terms of all user stories, but those user stories that were requested in the iteration are complete and the product can work to those limits.</p>\n",
            " <p>Yes, but it will only take 1 month to know you won't hit your 9-month-mythical-final-project-due-date instead of 9. </p>\n\n<p>Your reasoning is based on the assumption that upfront plans and detailed requirements for large projects are possible. Not sure there is a lot of evidence to support that. Maybe all the horror stories are just anecdotal? Any developer would love to work with complete and never changing specifications that the client fully agrees with and understands.</p>\n",
            " <p>\"late\" in an agile methodology means the same thing it means in a waterfall methodology: the estimates were wrong, the scope was too big for the allotted time, unexpected difficulties appeared, the customer wasn't responsive enough, the programmers got lazy, the machines crashed, your dog ate my bytecode, etc.</p>\n\n<p>you learn from it and adjust for the next iteration</p>\n\n<p>the difference is that this can happen every 2-4 weeks, so the lessons get learned and the process gets adjusted <em>rapidly</em></p>\n",
            " <p>Anytime you make a commitment of some kind, you run the risk of being late. That applies to agile as well.</p>\n\n<p>But we know you cannot predict the future, and we know the customer will constantly change his mind, and we agree that is a good thing. If we accept that, we must also accept that all commitments are pretty much always wrong, which, in turn, makes the question about lateness easy to answer: <strong>We are always wrong</strong> (to early or to late). It's all a matter of guesses, no matter how well polished. Toss a coin.</p>\n\n<p>This is something we as developers simply must accept, and from that standpoint try to find another way to work, a way in which the lateness issue is made much less important. A change of perspective. I think the way to do that is focusing on delivering working software as soon a possible, with an option of quitting when the customer is satisfied. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And that is what agile is all about. A clever way to managing \n  this uncomfortable notion that lateness is\n  a fact and we simply have to deal with it the best we can.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For example, you are late when you fail to deliver on the commitments you did at the beginning of the current iteration. This is expected and you should learn from this and adapt your process so you are less likely to fail in the next iteration. The best way to handle this is to keep iterations as small as possible.</p>\n\n<p>For multi iteration planning, aka release planning, you use the velocity calculated from the completed iterations and extrapolate the data to a predict a future release date. I recommend James Shores' <a href=\"http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Use-Risk-Management-to-Make-Solid-Commitments.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">article</a> or my <a href=\"http://blog.workingsoftware.se/2010/09/burn-up-or-burn-down.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">own</a> (shorter) for more details about this. Note that it's never a solid commitment though and more of a \"we are 80% certain that we will complete the next features by that date\". This can (sort of) result in you being late, but the commitment is only a probability, not a fact.</p>\n\n<p>Now par this with the basic promise of agile that you should always ready to release working software, feature complete or not. This gives the customer the freedom to stop development when he thinks the system is good enough, which can happen a lot sooner than anticipated. It also encourages taking the project in new directions based on real feedback from the latest iteration.</p>\n\n<p>The above points should be more then enough for any customer to be in full control of the development, and I hope that answers the question about lateness in agile methods.</p>\n",

            " <p>To expand on @KarlBielefeldt's answer, here's a full example of how to implement <em>Vectors</em> - lists with a statically-known number of elements - in Haskell. Hold on to your hat...</p>\n\n<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE ExistentialQuantification #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE DeriveFoldable #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE DeriveTraversable #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE KindSignatures #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE StandaloneDeriving #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}\n\nimport Prelude hiding (foldr, zipWith)\nimport qualified Prelude\nimport Data.Type.Equality\nimport Data.Foldable\nimport Data.Traversable\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see from the long list of <code>LANGUAGE</code> directives, this'll only work with a recent version of GHC.</p>\n\n<p>We need a way of representing lengths within the type system. By definition, a natural number is either zero (<code>Z</code>) or it's the successor of some other natural number (<code>S n</code>). So, for example, the number 3 would be written <code>S (S (S Z))</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>data Nat = Z | S Nat\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With the <a href=\"http://dreixel.net/research/pdf/ghp.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">DataKinds extension</a>, this <code>data</code> declaration introduces a <em>kind</em> called <code>Nat</code> and two <em>type</em> constructors called <code>S</code> and <code>Z</code> - in other words we have <em>type-level</em> natural numbers. Note that the types <code>S</code> and <code>Z</code> don't have any member values - only types of kind <code>*</code> are inhabited by values.</p>\n\n<p>Now we introduce a <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/GADT\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GADT</a> representing vectors with a known length. Note the kind signature: <code>Vec</code> requires a type <em>of kind <code>Nat</code></em> (ie a <code>Z</code> or an <code>S</code> type) to represent its length.</p>\n\n<pre><code>data Vec :: Nat -&gt; * -&gt; * where\n    VNil :: Vec Z a\n    VCons :: a -&gt; Vec n a -&gt; Vec (S n) a\nderiving instance (Show a) =&gt; Show (Vec n a)\nderiving instance Functor (Vec n)\nderiving instance Foldable (Vec n)\nderiving instance Traversable (Vec n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The definition of vectors is similar to that of linked lists, with some extra type-level information about its length. A vector is either <code>VNil</code>, in which case it has a length of <code>Z</code>(ero), or it's a <code>VCons</code> cell adding an item to another vector, in which case its length is one more than the other vector (<code>S n</code>). Note that there's no constructor argument of type <code>n</code>. It's just used at compile time to track lengths, and will be erased before the compiler generates machine code.</p>\n\n<p>We've defined a vector type which carries around static knowledge of its length. Let's query the type of a few <code>Vec</code>s to get a feel for how they work:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; :t (VCons 'a' (VCons 'b' VNil))\n(VCons 'a' (VCons 'b' VNil)) :: Vec ('S ('S 'Z)) Char  -- (S (S Z)) means 2\nghci&gt; :t (VCons 13 (VCons 11 (VCons 3 VNil)))\n(VCons 13 (VCons 11 (VCons 3 VNil))) :: Num a =&gt; Vec ('S ('S ('S 'Z))) a  -- (S (S (S Z))) means 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The dot product proceeds just as it would for a list:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-- note that the two Vec arguments are declared to have the same length\nvap :: Vec n (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Vec n a -&gt; Vec n b\nvap VNil VNil = VNil\nvap (VCons f fs) (VCons x xs) = VCons (f x) (vap fs xs)\n\nzipWith :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; Vec n a -&gt; Vec n b -&gt; Vec n c\nzipWith f xs ys = fmap f xs `vap` ys\n\ndot :: Num a =&gt; Vec n a -&gt; Vec n a -&gt; a\ndot xs ys = foldr (+) 0 $ zipWith (*) xs ys\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>vap</code>, which 'zippily' applies a vector of functions to a vector of arguments, is <code>Vec</code>'s applicative <code>&lt;*&gt;</code>; I didn't put it in an <code>Applicative</code> instance because <a href=\"https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/pub/hasochism.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">it gets messy</a>. Note also that I'm using the <code>foldr</code> from the compiler-generated instance of <code>Foldable</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Let's try it out:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; let v1 = VCons 2 (VCons 1 VNil)\nghci&gt; let v2 = VCons 4 (VCons 5 VNil)\nghci&gt; v1 `dot` v2\n13\nghci&gt; let v3 = VCons 8 (VCons 6 (VCons 1 VNil))\nghci&gt; v1 `dot` v3\n&lt;interactive&gt;:20:10:\n    Couldn't match type \u2018'S 'Z\u2019 with \u2018'Z\u2019\n    Expected type: Vec ('S ('S 'Z)) a\n      Actual type: Vec ('S ('S ('S 'Z))) a\n    In the second argument of \u2018dot\u2019, namely \u2018v3\u2019\n    In the expression: v1 `dot` v3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Great! You get a compile-time error when you try to <code>dot</code> vectors whose lengths don't match.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Here's an attempt at a function to concatenate vectors together:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-- This won't compile because the type checker can't deduce the length of the returned vector\n-- VNil +++ ys = ys\n-- (VCons x xs) +++ ys = VCons x (concat xs ys)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The length of the output vector would be the <em>sum</em> of the lengths of the two input vectors. We need to teach the type checker how to add <code>Nat</code>s together. For this we use a <a href=\"https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Type_families\" rel=\"noreferrer\">type-level function</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>type family (n :: Nat) :+: (m :: Nat) :: Nat where\n    Z :+: m = m\n    (S n) :+: m = S (n :+: m)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This <code>type family</code> declaration introduces a <em>function on types</em> called <code>:+:</code> - in other words, it's a recipe for the type checker to calculate the sum of two natural numbers. It's defined recursively - whenever the left operand is greater than <code>Z</code>ero we add one to the output and reduce it by one in the recursive call. (It's a good exercise to write a type function which multiplies two <code>Nat</code>s.) Now we can make <code>+++</code> compile:</p>\n\n<pre><code>infixr 5 +++\n(+++) :: Vec n a -&gt; Vec m a -&gt; Vec (n :+: m) a\nVNil +++ ys = ys\n(VCons x xs) +++ ys = VCons x (concat xs ys)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's how you use it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; VCons 1 (VCons 2 VNil) +++ VCons 3 (VCons 4 VNil)\nVCons 1 (VCons 2 (VCons 3 (VCons 4 VNil)))\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So far so simple. What about when we want to do the opposite of concatenation and split a vector in two? The lengths of the output vectors depend on the runtime value of the arguments. We'd like to write something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-- this won't work because there aren't any values of type `S` and `Z`\n-- split :: (n :: Nat) -&gt; Vec (n :+: m) a -&gt; (Vec n a, Vec m a)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but unfortunately Haskell won't let us do that. Allowing the <em>value</em> of the <code>n</code> argument to appear in the <em>return type</em> (this is commonly called a <em>dependent function</em> or <em>pi type</em>) would require \"full-spectrum\" dependent types, whereas <code>DataKinds</code> only gives us promoted type constructors. To put it another way, the type constructors <code>S</code> and <code>Z</code> don't appear at the value level. We'll have to settle for <a href=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eir/papers/2012/singletons/paper.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>singleton values</em></a> for a run-time representation of a certain <code>Nat</code>.*</p>\n\n<pre><code>data Natty (n :: Nat) where\n    Zy :: Natty Z  -- pronounced 'zed-y'\n    Sy :: Natty n -&gt; Natty (S n)  -- pronounced 'ess-y'\nderiving instance Show (Natty n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For a given type <code>n</code> (with kind <code>Nat</code>), there is precisely one term of type <code>Natty n</code>. We can use the singleton value as a run-time witness for <code>n</code>: learning about a <code>Natty</code> teaches us about its <code>n</code> and vice versa.</p>\n\n<pre><code>split :: Natty n -&gt;\n         Vec (n :+: m) a -&gt;  -- the input Vec has to be at least as long as the input Natty\n         (Vec n a, Vec m a)\nsplit Zy xs = (Nil, xs)\nsplit (Sy n) (Cons x xs) = let (ys, zs) = split n xs\n                           in (Cons x ys, zs)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let's take it for a spin:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; split (Sy (Sy Zy)) (VCons 1 (VCons 2 (VCons 3 VNil)))\n(VCons 1 (VCons 2 VNil), VCons 3 VNil)\nghci&gt; split (Sy (Sy Zy)) (VCons 3 VNil)\n&lt;interactive&gt;:116:21:\n    Couldn't match type \u2018'S ('Z :+: m)\u2019 with \u2018'Z\u2019\n    Expected type: Vec ('S ('S 'Z) :+: m) a\n      Actual type: Vec ('S 'Z) a\n    Relevant bindings include\n      it :: (Vec ('S ('S 'Z)) a, Vec m a) (bound at &lt;interactive&gt;:116:1)\n    In the second argument of \u2018split\u2019, namely \u2018(VCons 3 VNil)\u2019\n    In the expression: split (Sy (Sy Zy)) (VCons 3 VNil)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the first example, we successfully split a three-element vector at position 2; then we got a type error when we tried to split a vector at a position past the end. Singletons are the standard technique for making a type depend on a value in Haskell.</p>\n\n<p><sub>* The <a href=\"https://hackage.haskell.org/package/singletons\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>singletons</code> library</a> contains some Template Haskell helpers to generate singleton values like <code>Natty</code> for you.</sub></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Last example. What about when you don't know the dimensionality of your vector statically? For example, what if we're trying to build a vector from run-time data in the form of a list? You need the <em>type</em> of the vector to depend on the <em>length</em> of the input list. To put it another way, we can't use <code>foldr VCons VNil</code> to build a vector because the type of the output vector changes with each iteration of the fold. We need to keep the length of the vector a secret from the compiler.</p>\n\n<pre><code>data AVec a = forall n. AVec (Natty n) (Vec n a)\nderiving instance (Show a) =&gt; Show (AVec a)\n\nfromList :: [a] -&gt; AVec a\nfromList = Prelude.foldr cons nil\n    where cons x (AVec n xs) = AVec (Sy n) (VCons x xs)\n          nil = AVec Zy VNil\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>AVec</code> is an <a href=\"https://wiki.haskell.org/Existential_type\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>existential type</em></a>: the type variable <code>n</code> does not appear in the return type of the <code>AVec</code> data constructor. We're using it to simulate a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type#Dependent_pair_type\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>dependent pair</em></a>: <code>fromList</code> can't tell you the length of the vector statically, but it can return something you can pattern-match on to <em>learn</em> the length of the vector - the <code>Natty n</code> in the first element of the tuple. As Conor McBride puts it in <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/27030038/1523776\">a related answer</a>, \"You look at one thing, and in doing so, learn about another\".</p>\n\n<p>This is a common technique for existentially quantified types. Because you can't actually do anything with data for which you don't know the type - try writing a function of <code>data Something = forall a. Sth a</code> - existentials often come bundled up with GADT evidence which allows you to recover the original type by performing pattern-matching tests. Other common patterns for existentials include packaging up functions to process your type (<code>data AWayToGetTo b = forall a. HeresHow a (a -&gt; b)</code>) which is a neat way of doing first-class modules, or building-in a type class dictionary (<code>data AnOrd = forall a. Ord a =&gt; AnOrd a</code>) which can help emulate subtype polymorphism.</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; fromList [1,2,3]\nAVec (Sy (Sy (Sy Zy))) (VCons 1 (VCons 2 (VCons 3 Nil)))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Dependent pairs are useful whenever the static properties of data depend on dynamic information not available at compile time.

There are also a few functions to help you work with this type: we'll be using <a href=\"https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.2/docs/Data-Type-Equality.html#g:2\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>gcastWith</code></a> to convert between equivalent types, and <a href=\"https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.2/docs/Data-Type-Equality.html#g:3\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>TestEquality</code></a> to determine whether two <code>Natty</code>s are equal.</p>\n\n<p>To test the equality of two <code>Natty</code>s, we're going to need to make use of the fact that if two numbers are equal, then their successors are also equal (<code>:~:</code> is <em>congruent</em> over <code>S</code>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>congSuc :: (n :~: m) -&gt; (S n :~: S m)\ncongSuc Refl = Refl\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Pattern matching on <code>Refl</code> on the left-hand side lets GHC know that <code>n ~ m</code>. With that knowledge, it's trivial that <code>S n ~ S m</code>, so GHC lets us return a new <code>Refl</code> right away.</p>\n\n<p>Now we can write an instance of <code>TestEquality</code> by straightforward recursion. If both numbers are zero, they are equal. If both numbers have predecessors, they are equal iff the predecessors are equal. (If they're not equal, just return <code>Nothing</code>.)</p>\n\n<pre><code>instance TestEquality Natty where\n    -- testEquality :: Natty n -&gt; Natty m -&gt; Maybe (n :~: m)\n    testEquality Zy Zy = Just Refl\n    testEquality (Sy n) (Sy m) = fmap congSuc (testEquality n m)  -- check whether the predecessors are equal, then make use of congruence\n    testEquality Zy _ = Nothing\n    testEquality _ Zy = Nothing\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we can put the pieces together to <code>dot</code> a pair of <code>AVec</code>s of unknown length.</p>\n\n<pre><code>dot' :: Num a =&gt; AVec a -&gt; AVec a -&gt; Maybe a\ndot' (AVec n u) (AVec m v) = fmap (\\proof -&gt; gcastWith proof (dot u v)) (testEquality n m)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>First, pattern match on the <code>AVec</code> constructor to pull out a runtime representation of the vectors' lengths. Now use <code>testEquality</code> to determine whether those lengths are equal. If they are, we'll have <code>Just Refl</code>; <code>gcastWith</code> will use that equality proof to ensure that <code>dot u v</code> is well-typed by discharging its implicit <code>n ~ m</code> assumption.</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; let v1 = fromList [1,2,3]\nghci&gt; let v2 = fromList [4,5,6]\nghci&gt; let v3 = fromList [7,8]\nghci&gt; dot' v1 v2\nJust 32\nghci&gt; dot' v1 v3\nNothing  -- they weren't the same length\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that, since a vector without static knowledge of its length is basically a list, we've effectively re-implemented the list version of <code>dot :: Num a =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; Maybe a</code>. The difference is that this version is implemented in terms of the vectors' <code>dot</code>. Here's the point: before the type checker will allow you to call <code>dot</code>, <strong>you must have tested</strong> whether the input lists have the same length using <code>testEquality</code>. I am prone to getting <code>if</code>-statements the wrong way round, but not in a dependently-typed setting!</p>\n\n<p>You can't avoid using existential wrappers at the edges of your system, when you're dealing with runtime data, but you can use dependent types everywhere inside your system and keep the existential wrappers at the edges, when you perform input validation.</p>\n\n<p>Since <code>Nothing</code>is not very informative, you could further refine the type of <code>dot'</code> to return <em>a proof that the lengths aren't equal</em> (in the form of evidence that their difference is not 0) in the failure case. This is pretty similar to the standard Haskell technique of using <code>Either String a</code> to possibly return an error message, although a proof term is far more computationally useful than a string!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Thus ends this whistle-stop tour of some of the techniques that are common in dependently-typed Haskell programming. Programming with types like this in Haskell is really cool, but really awkward at the same time. Breaking up all your dependent data into lots of representations which mean the same thing - <code>Nat</code> the type, <code>Nat</code> the kind, <code>Natty n</code> the singleton - is really quite cumbersome, despite the existence of code-generators to help with the boilerplate. There are also presently limitations on what can be promoted to the type level. It's tantalising though! The mind boggles at the possibilities - in the literature there are examples in Haskell of strongly typed <code>printf</code>, database interfaces, UI layout engines...</p>\n\n<p>If you want some further reading, there's a growing body of literature about dependently typed Haskell, both published and on sites like Stack Overflow. A good starting point is <a href=\"https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/pub/hasochism.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the <em>Hasochism</em> paper</a> - the paper goes through this very example (among others), discussing the painful parts in some detail. <a href=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eir/papers/2012/singletons/paper.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The <em>Singletons</em> paper</a> demonstrates the technique of singleton values (such as <code>Natty</code>).

        "sft_target": " <p>To expand on @KarlBielefeldt's answer, here's a full example of how to implement <em>Vectors</em> - lists with a statically-known number of elements - in Haskell. Hold on to your hat...</p>\n\n<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE ExistentialQuantification #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE DeriveFoldable #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE DeriveTraversable #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE KindSignatures #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE StandaloneDeriving #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}\n\nimport Prelude hiding (foldr, zipWith)\nimport qualified Prelude\nimport Data.Type.Equality\nimport Data.Foldable\nimport Data.Traversable\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see from the long list of <code>LANGUAGE</code> directives, this'll only work with a recent version of GHC.</p>\n\n<p>We need a way of representing lengths within the type system. By definition, a natural number is either zero (<code>Z</code>) or it's the successor of some other natural number (<code>S n</code>). So, for example, the number 3 would be written <code>S (S (S Z))</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>data Nat = Z | S Nat\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With the <a href=\"http://dreixel.net/research/pdf/ghp.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">DataKinds extension</a>, this <code>data</code> declaration introduces a <em>kind</em> called <code>Nat</code> and two <em>type</em> constructors called <code>S</code> and <code>Z</code> - in other words we have <em>type-level</em> natural numbers. Note that the types <code>S</code> and <code>Z</code> don't have any member values - only types of kind <code>*</code> are inhabited by values.</p>\n\n<p>Now we introduce a <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/GADT\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GADT</a> representing vectors with a known length. Note the kind signature: <code>Vec</code> requires a type <em>of kind <code>Nat</code></em> (ie a <code>Z</code> or an <code>S</code> type) to represent its length.</p>\n\n<pre><code>data Vec :: Nat -&gt; * -&gt; * where\n    VNil :: Vec Z a\n    VCons :: a -&gt; Vec n a -&gt; Vec (S n) a\nderiving instance (Show a) =&gt; Show (Vec n a)\nderiving instance Functor (Vec n)\nderiving instance Foldable (Vec n)\nderiving instance Traversable (Vec n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The definition of vectors is similar to that of linked lists, with some extra type-level information about its length. A vector is either <code>VNil</code>, in which case it has a length of <code>Z</code>(ero), or it's a <code>VCons</code> cell adding an item to another vector, in which case its length is one more than the other vector (<code>S n</code>). Note that there's no constructor argument of type <code>n</code>. It's just used at compile time to track lengths, and will be erased before the compiler generates machine code.</p>\n\n<p>We've defined a vector type which carries around static knowledge of its length. Let's query the type of a few <code>Vec</code>s to get a feel for how they work:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; :t (VCons 'a' (VCons 'b' VNil))\n(VCons 'a' (VCons 'b' VNil)) :: Vec ('S ('S 'Z)) Char  -- (S (S Z)) means 2\nghci&gt; :t (VCons 13 (VCons 11 (VCons 3 VNil)))\n(VCons 13 (VCons 11 (VCons 3 VNil))) :: Num a =&gt; Vec ('S ('S ('S 'Z))) a  -- (S (S (S Z))) means 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The dot product proceeds just as it would for a list:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-- note that the two Vec arguments are declared to have the same length\nvap :: Vec n (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Vec n a -&gt; Vec n b\nvap VNil VNil = VNil\nvap (VCons f fs) (VCons x xs) = VCons (f x) (vap fs xs)\n\nzipWith :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; Vec n a -&gt; Vec n b -&gt; Vec n c\nzipWith f xs ys = fmap f xs `vap` ys\n\ndot :: Num a =&gt; Vec n a -&gt; Vec n a -&gt; a\ndot xs ys = foldr (+) 0 $ zipWith (*) xs ys\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>vap</code>, which 'zippily' applies a vector of functions to a vector of arguments, is <code>Vec</code>'s applicative <code>&lt;*&gt;</code>; I didn't put it in an <code>Applicative</code> instance because <a href=\"https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/pub/hasochism.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">it gets messy</a>. Note also that I'm using the <code>foldr</code> from the compiler-generated instance of <code>Foldable</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Let's try it out:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; let v1 = VCons 2 (VCons 1 VNil)\nghci&gt; let v2 = VCons 4 (VCons 5 VNil)\nghci&gt; v1 `dot` v2\n13\nghci&gt; let v3 = VCons 8 (VCons 6 (VCons 1 VNil))\nghci&gt; v1 `dot` v3\n&lt;interactive&gt;:20:10:\n    Couldn't match type \u2018'S 'Z\u2019 with \u2018'Z\u2019\n    Expected type: Vec ('S ('S 'Z)) a\n      Actual type: Vec ('S ('S ('S 'Z))) a\n    In the second argument of \u2018dot\u2019, namely \u2018v3\u2019\n    In the expression: v1 `dot` v3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Great! You get a compile-time error when you try to <code>dot</code> vectors whose lengths don't match.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Here's an attempt at a function to concatenate vectors together:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-- This won't compile because the type checker can't deduce the length of the returned vector\n-- VNil +++ ys = ys\n-- (VCons x xs) +++ ys = VCons x (concat xs ys)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The length of the output vector would be the <em>sum</em> of the lengths of the two input vectors. We need to teach the type checker how to add <code>Nat</code>s together. For this we use a <a href=\"https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Type_families\" rel=\"noreferrer\">type-level function</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>type family (n :: Nat) :+: (m :: Nat) :: Nat where\n    Z :+: m = m\n    (S n) :+: m = S (n :+: m)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This <code>type family</code> declaration introduces a <em>function on types</em> called <code>:+:</code> - in other words, it's a recipe for the type checker to calculate the sum of two natural numbers. It's defined recursively - whenever the left operand is greater than <code>Z</code>ero we add one to the output and reduce it by one in the recursive call. (It's a good exercise to write a type function which multiplies two <code>Nat</code>s.) Now we can make <code>+++</code> compile:</p>\n\n<pre><code>infixr 5 +++\n(+++) :: Vec n a -&gt; Vec m a -&gt; Vec (n :+: m) a\nVNil +++ ys = ys\n(VCons x xs) +++ ys = VCons x (concat xs ys)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's how you use it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; VCons 1 (VCons 2 VNil) +++ VCons 3 (VCons 4 VNil)\nVCons 1 (VCons 2 (VCons 3 (VCons 4 VNil)))\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So far so simple. What about when we want to do the opposite of concatenation and split a vector in two? The lengths of the output vectors depend on the runtime value of the arguments. We'd like to write something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-- this won't work because there aren't any values of type `S` and `Z`\n-- split :: (n :: Nat) -&gt; Vec (n :+: m) a -&gt; (Vec n a, Vec m a)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but unfortunately Haskell won't let us do that. Allowing the <em>value</em> of the <code>n</code> argument to appear in the <em>return type</em> (this is commonly called a <em>dependent function</em> or <em>pi type</em>) would require \"full-spectrum\" dependent types, whereas <code>DataKinds</code> only gives us promoted type constructors. To put it another way, the type constructors <code>S</code> and <code>Z</code> don't appear at the value level. We'll have to settle for <a href=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eir/papers/2012/singletons/paper.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>singleton values</em></a> for a run-time representation of a certain <code>Nat</code>.*</p>\n\n<pre><code>data Natty (n :: Nat) where\n    Zy :: Natty Z  -- pronounced 'zed-y'\n    Sy :: Natty n -&gt; Natty (S n)  -- pronounced 'ess-y'\nderiving instance Show (Natty n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For a given type <code>n</code> (with kind <code>Nat</code>), there is precisely one term of type <code>Natty n</code>. We can use the singleton value as a run-time witness for <code>n</code>: learning about a <code>Natty</code> teaches us about its <code>n</code> and vice versa.</p>\n\n<pre><code>split :: Natty n -&gt;\n         Vec (n :+: m) a -&gt;  -- the input Vec has to be at least as long as the input Natty\n         (Vec n a, Vec m a)\nsplit Zy xs = (Nil, xs)\nsplit (Sy n) (Cons x xs) = let (ys, zs) = split n xs\n                           in (Cons x ys, zs)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let's take it for a spin:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; split (Sy (Sy Zy)) (VCons 1 (VCons 2 (VCons 3 VNil)))\n(VCons 1 (VCons 2 VNil), VCons 3 VNil)\nghci&gt; split (Sy (Sy Zy)) (VCons 3 VNil)\n&lt;interactive&gt;:116:21:\n    Couldn't match type \u2018'S ('Z :+: m)\u2019 with \u2018'Z\u2019\n    Expected type: Vec ('S ('S 'Z) :+: m) a\n      Actual type: Vec ('S 'Z) a\n    Relevant bindings include\n      it :: (Vec ('S ('S 'Z)) a, Vec m a) (bound at &lt;interactive&gt;:116:1)\n    In the second argument of \u2018split\u2019, namely \u2018(VCons 3 VNil)\u2019\n    In the expression: split (Sy (Sy Zy)) (VCons 3 VNil)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the first example, we successfully split a three-element vector at position 2; then we got a type error when we tried to split a vector at a position past the end. Singletons are the standard technique for making a type depend on a value in Haskell.</p>\n\n<p><sub>* The <a href=\"https://hackage.haskell.org/package/singletons\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>singletons</code> library</a> contains some Template Haskell helpers to generate singleton values like <code>Natty</code> for you.</sub></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Last example. What about when you don't know the dimensionality of your vector statically? For example, what if we're trying to build a vector from run-time data in the form of a list? You need the <em>type</em> of the vector to depend on the <em>length</em> of the input list. To put it another way, we can't use <code>foldr VCons VNil</code> to build a vector because the type of the output vector changes with each iteration of the fold. We need to keep the length of the vector a secret from the compiler.</p>\n\n<pre><code>data AVec a = forall n. AVec (Natty n) (Vec n a)\nderiving instance (Show a) =&gt; Show (AVec a)\n\nfromList :: [a] -&gt; AVec a\nfromList = Prelude.foldr cons nil\n    where cons x (AVec n xs) = AVec (Sy n) (VCons x xs)\n          nil = AVec Zy VNil\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>AVec</code> is an <a href=\"https://wiki.haskell.org/Existential_type\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>existential type</em></a>: the type variable <code>n</code> does not appear in the return type of the <code>AVec</code> data constructor. We're using it to simulate a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type#Dependent_pair_type\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>dependent pair</em></a>: <code>fromList</code> can't tell you the length of the vector statically, but it can return something you can pattern-match on to <em>learn</em> the length of the vector - the <code>Natty n</code> in the first element of the tuple. As Conor McBride puts it in <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/27030038/1523776\">a related answer</a>, \"You look at one thing, and in doing so, learn about another\".</p>\n\n<p>This is a common technique for existentially quantified types. Because you can't actually do anything with data for which you don't know the type - try writing a function of <code>data Something = forall a. Sth a</code> - existentials often come bundled up with GADT evidence which allows you to recover the original type by performing pattern-matching tests. Other common patterns for existentials include packaging up functions to process your type (<code>data AWayToGetTo b = forall a. HeresHow a (a -&gt; b)</code>) which is a neat way of doing first-class modules, or building-in a type class dictionary (<code>data AnOrd = forall a. Ord a =&gt; AnOrd a</code>) which can help emulate subtype polymorphism.</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; fromList [1,2,3]\nAVec (Sy (Sy (Sy Zy))) (VCons 1 (VCons 2 (VCons 3 Nil)))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Dependent pairs are useful whenever the static properties of data depend on dynamic information not available at compile time. Here's <code>filter</code> for vectors:</p>\n\n<pre><code>filter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Vec n a -&gt; AVec a\nfilter f = foldr (\\x (AVec n xs) -&gt; if f x\n                                    then AVec (Sy n) (VCons x xs)\n                                    else AVec n xs) (AVec Zy VNil) \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To <code>dot</code> two <code>AVec</code>s, we need to prove to GHC that their lengths are equal. <a href=\"https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.2/docs/Data-Type-Equality.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>Data.Type.Equality</code></a> defines a GADT which can only be constructed when its type arguments are the same:</p>\n\n<pre><code>data (a :: k) :~: (b :: k) where\n    Refl :: a :~: a  -- short for 'reflexivity'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When you pattern-match on <code>Refl</code>, GHC knows that <code>a ~ b</code>. There are also a few functions to help you work with this type: we'll be using <a href=\"https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.2/docs/Data-Type-Equality.html#g:2\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>gcastWith</code></a> to convert between equivalent types, and <a href=\"https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.2/docs/Data-Type-Equality.html#g:3\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>TestEquality</code></a> to determine whether two <code>Natty</code>s are equal.</p>\n\n<p>To test the equality of two <code>Natty</code>s, we're going to need to make use of the fact that if two numbers are equal, then their successors are also equal (<code>:~:</code> is <em>congruent</em> over <code>S</code>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>congSuc :: (n :~: m) -&gt; (S n :~: S m)\ncongSuc Refl = Refl\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Pattern matching on <code>Refl</code> on the left-hand side lets GHC know that <code>n ~ m</code>. With that knowledge, it's trivial that <code>S n ~ S m</code>, so GHC lets us return a new <code>Refl</code> right away.</p>\n\n<p>Now we can write an instance of <code>TestEquality</code> by straightforward recursion. If both numbers are zero, they are equal. If both numbers have predecessors, they are equal iff the predecessors are equal. (If they're not equal, just return <code>Nothing</code>.)</p>\n\n<pre><code>instance TestEquality Natty where\n    -- testEquality :: Natty n -&gt; Natty m -&gt; Maybe (n :~: m)\n    testEquality Zy Zy = Just Refl\n    testEquality (Sy n) (Sy m) = fmap congSuc (testEquality n m)  -- check whether the predecessors are equal, then make use of congruence\n    testEquality Zy _ = Nothing\n    testEquality _ Zy = Nothing\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we can put the pieces together to <code>dot</code> a pair of <code>AVec</code>s of unknown length.</p>\n\n<pre><code>dot' :: Num a =&gt; AVec a -&gt; AVec a -&gt; Maybe a\ndot' (AVec n u) (AVec m v) = fmap (\\proof -&gt; gcastWith proof (dot u v)) (testEquality n m)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>First, pattern match on the <code>AVec</code> constructor to pull out a runtime representation of the vectors' lengths. Now use <code>testEquality</code> to determine whether those lengths are equal. If they are, we'll have <code>Just Refl</code>; <code>gcastWith</code> will use that equality proof to ensure that <code>dot u v</code> is well-typed by discharging its implicit <code>n ~ m</code> assumption.</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; let v1 = fromList [1,2,3]\nghci&gt; let v2 = fromList [4,5,6]\nghci&gt; let v3 = fromList [7,8]\nghci&gt; dot' v1 v2\nJust 32\nghci&gt; dot' v1 v3\nNothing  -- they weren't the same length\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that, since a vector without static knowledge of its length is basically a list, we've effectively re-implemented the list version of <code>dot :: Num a =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; Maybe a</code>. The difference is that this version is implemented in terms of the vectors' <code>dot</code>. Here's the point: before the type checker will allow you to call <code>dot</code>, <strong>you must have tested</strong> whether the input lists have the same length using <code>testEquality</code>. I am prone to getting <code>if</code>-statements the wrong way round, but not in a dependently-typed setting!</p>\n\n<p>You can't avoid using existential wrappers at the edges of your system, when you're dealing with runtime data, but you can use dependent types everywhere inside your system and keep the existential wrappers at the edges, when you perform input validation.</p>\n\n<p>Since <code>Nothing</code>is not very informative, you could further refine the type of <code>dot'</code> to return <em>a proof that the lengths aren't equal</em> (in the form of evidence that their difference is not 0) in the failure case. This is pretty similar to the standard Haskell technique of using <code>Either String a</code> to possibly return an error message, although a proof term is far more computationally useful than a string!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Thus ends this whistle-stop tour of some of the techniques that are common in dependently-typed Haskell programming. Programming with types like this in Haskell is really cool, but really awkward at the same time. Breaking up all your dependent data into lots of representations which mean the same thing - <code>Nat</code> the type, <code>Nat</code> the kind, <code>Natty n</code> the singleton - is really quite cumbersome, despite the existence of code-generators to help with the boilerplate. There are also presently limitations on what can be promoted to the type level. It's tantalising though! The mind boggles at the possibilities - in the literature there are examples in Haskell of strongly typed <code>printf</code>, database interfaces, UI layout engines...</p>\n\n<p>If you want some further reading, there's a growing body of literature about dependently typed Haskell, both published and on sites like Stack Overflow. A good starting point is <a href=\"https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/pub/hasochism.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the <em>Hasochism</em> paper</a> - the paper goes through this very example (among others), discussing the painful parts in some detail. <a href=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eir/papers/2012/singletons/paper.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The <em>Singletons</em> paper</a> demonstrates the technique of singleton values (such as <code>Natty</code>).

If it's your code, you should have a very good idea of what is causing the error before you attempt to fix it. </p>\n\n<p>Futhermore, when you write your code you should already know where and why it's likely to fail.</p>\n\n<p>Having said that - asking a peer, posting on SO, retracing and rolling back your steps and taking a break - all the suggestions mentioned above will help.</p>\n\n<p>The other thing, is you must know your tools - your debugging toolkit. Logging messages at suspect points in your code, examining your call stack carefully, using conditional breakpoints and watches, etc etc. Debugging skills are not extras - they are part of programming.</p>\n",

            " <p>All of these suggestions are great.  However, I use a technique quite often that I didn't see mentioned.  Make lists to organize your thoughts about the problem.  If I have a particularly sticky problem I usually write out multiple lists such as: Facts, Assumptions, Questions, Symptoms, etc.  I find that oftentimes in the process of organizing things in this way I discover assumptions I didn't realize I had (that often turn out to be wrong), questions I didn't realize need to be asked, other permutations I can check, etc.</p>\n",

            " <p>I really didn't like the most up-voted answer, because even though that sometime works, some times you just need to figure it out that same day, so what I'd recommend, in this order, is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Confirm that it's not only happening to you. This can save you a lot of time. Maybe you uninstalled a required component, or made a change in your environment, and an exception is being swallowed somewhere in your code. If it's happening only to you, I would use an environment comparison tool. I recently read about a software called Envy, which allows you to do just that, although it's not freeware, it costs 10 USD.</p></li>\n<li><p>Happening to everybody? Fine, now do a View History on the code and verify for recent changes that might have caused the error, either directly or indirectly.</p></li>\n<li><p>There aren't any recent changes? If it's a very specific error (an exception), 'stackoverflow it'. Now that doesn't sound better than 'google it' but I feel good to say I first search stackoverflow for programming research than google. If it's a really known issue, it's very likely that you'll find a solution here. If not, then post a question on the related stackexchange site. You might get a very quick answer, or even if you don't, your question will be out there while you do more research. That's a benefit.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you didn't find an answer online or it isn't a general error, then walk through the code step by step, checking if the obtained results of each step make sense for the result you expect. Go start to finish on each method, and bottom to top on a tiered solution. (i.e. if you're troubleshooting performance, start with the code that retrieves the records. doesn't make sense to start in the UI if you can determine quickly if the first step is the problem).</p></li>\n<li><p>If after going through the code a couple of times you still haven't found what's wrong, call-in someone to talk about it. As someone already mentioned, talking about it out loud can light the bulb. Plus pair-programming is really useful.</p></li>\n<li><p>At this point, if it's feasible, walk away either for some time or for the day. I read a very true tweet yesterday that said \"I went to bed thinking 'how the fck' and woke up thinking 'but of course'\". So true.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you still don't have an answer, I'd dare say you could try refactoring into smaller tasks/methods/functions. Henry Ford said something like 'There isn't a task so complex that cannot be accomplished by breaking it into smaller tasks'. At this point, if the solution is too complex and you haven't figured out either by yourself or with the help of someone else, refactor the code into smaller tasks. Even if you don't end up commiting it, it can help you find the reason.</p></li>\n<li><p>Add instrumentation to your code.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tweet about it??</p></li>\n</ol>\n",

The computer's strength is its logic so you can't win on logic. You have a brain and have to out-think it. </p>\n\n<p>In modern times there are so many other things interacting on a system - firewalls, AV, Antispyware, automatic updates happening every night - you have to deal with moving targets.</p>\n"

We then create a <code>RequestC</code> class that inherits from <code>Request</code> as well (and this cycle can goes on and on).</p>\n<p>How should we design the relationship between <code>User</code> and the different kinds of <code>Request</code>s that our system has?</p>\n<p>If we directly couple them (please ignore the poor encapsulation):</p>\n<pre><code>public class User\n{\n    public RequestA RequestA;\n    public RequestB RequestB;\n    public RequestC RequestC;\n\n    // Foo calls methods from RequestA and RequestB\n    public void Foo();\n    \n    // Boo calls methods from RequestC\n    public void Boo();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, to my understanding, we are forever violating the open/close principle as we will be always modifying our <code>User</code> class when new kinds of <code>Request</code> are created.</p>\n<p>Another solution I can think of is to create a collection of <code>Request</code> to hold all the requests there, and make downcasts to <code>RequestA</code> and <code>RequestB</code> inside our <code>Foo</code> method and to <code>RequestC</code> inside <code>Boo</code> and follow this in possible new methods and/or new request classes (assuming the downcast is valid, of course).</p>\n<p>I have the feeling that the second approach is not correct either and that there could be a proper way to design such relationship.</p>\n<p>That being said, how should we design this relationship (between users and the different types of requests) and keep following all the principles of clean code accepted in the community?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

That's polymorphism. User doesn't have to know what it's talking to.

Briefly, this application allows the user to create contracts for subscribers with two constraints:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You cannot create more than one contract for a subscriber.</li>\n<li>Once a contract is created, it cannot be deleted (from the UI).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let's say TestCreate is a test case with tests for the normal creation of a contract.</p>\n\n<p>The constraints have introduced complexities to the testing process, mainly dependencies between test cases and test executions.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Before we run TestCreate we need to make sure that the application is in a suitable state (the subscriber has no contract)</li>\n<li>If we run TestCreate twice, the second run will fail since the state of the application will have changed.</li>\n<li>So we need to revert back to the initial state (i.e. delete the contract), which is impossible to do from the UI.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>More generally, after each test case we should guarantee that the state is reverted back. And since, in this case, it is impossible to do it from the UI, how do you handle this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Possible solution</strong>: I thought about doing a backup of the database in the state that I desire, and after each test case, run a script which deletes the db and restores the backup. However, I find that to be too heavy to do for each single test case. In addition, what if some information are stored in files? or in multiple or unaccessible databases? </p>\n\n<p><strong>My question:</strong> In this situation, what would an experienced tester do to write automated and maintanable tests. Thank you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>More info</strong>: I'm trying to integrate tests into a BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) framework, which I find to be a neat solution for test documentation and communication, but it does not solve this particular problem (it even makes it harder)</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

That means you have a function that is effectively: <code>NEW_NUMBER = (A * OLD_NUMBER + B) MOD C</code>. If you chart NEW_NUMBER vs OLD_NUMBER you will start to see diagonal lines. Some of the notes on <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.rand.php\">PHP's RAND documentation</a> give examples of how to do so. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>This is coming up because I saw a auth library which uses rand() to produce a token for users who have lost passwords, and I assumed this was a potential security hole.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On a windows machine, the max value of RAND is 2^15. This gives the attacker only 32,768 possibilities to check. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Could someone reasonably figure out what random # was generated via rand() at a given moment in time within a few thousand guesses? or even 10,000 guesses? How?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While <a href=\"http://www.developer.com/tech/article.php/616221/How-We-Learned-to-Cheat-at-Online-Poker-A-Study-in-Software-Security.htm\">this article</a> isn't exactly the one you are looking for, it shows how some researchers took an existing implementation of a random number generator and used it to make money on Texas Holdem. There are 52! possible shuffled decks, but the implementation used a 32-bit random number generator (which is the max number out of mt_getrandmax on a windows machine), and seeded it with the time in milliseconds since midnight. This reduced the number of possible shuffled decks from about 2^226 to about 2^27 making it possible to search in real time and know what deck has been dealt. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>After doing this I realized that if I were on the outside looking in, I'd have no idea how to guess the token even knowing it was a md5 of rand().</em>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'd recommend using something in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2\">SHA-2</a> family as the feds consider md5 broken. Some folks use google to decrypt md5 hashes because they are so common.

They cannot be deployed by a developer alone. Professional programmers have to work with others. It's not just a matter of good knowledge of tools (like languages, IDEs etc.) but also of techniques, methods and idioms.</p></li>\n<li><p>While tools can be taught by formal samples and exercise, techniques and idioms can only be \"described\". To \"learn\" them you have to experience and share the experience with others. They are continuously invented and improved.</p></li>\n<li><p>Companies, when hiring from school, check your understanding of tools and your ability with basic technics, but - most important - test your capability in rapidly learning new things and \"capture the work\" as it is needed.</p></li>\n<li><p>When hiring for experienced people, they look at how many things they have done and what experience they got from those things.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Moral:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If you want to be more \"evaluated\" learn to work with others, by participating in other's problems (like on <a href=\"http://www.stackoverflow.com\">stackoverflow</a>) or open projects (like on <a href=\"http://www.sourceforge.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">sourceforge</a>) </p></li>\n<li><p>Also, don't be too fast to ask for money; split your \"code production\" in \"something to share\" and \"something to sell\".  What you can share can be used by others but can also attract the participation of others to expand the initial project. What you can sell is what makes your app \"unique\" with respect to other similar projects, leading it to become a real commercial product.<br>\nTo share code with others, you can refer to site <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">codeproject</a> or <a href=\"http://www.sourceforge.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">sourceforge</a>.

            " <p>A few things you might want to try:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Write software that solves real problems, ideally problems that haven't been solved before (or at least not satisfyingly so). If nobody uses your software despite your best promotional efforts, chances are they simply don't need it that desperately.</li>\n<li>Announce your work on relevant mailing lists, IRC channels and internet forums. If your program makes extensive use of some library, consider posting to the library's community; if it complements other existing pieces of software, announce to their communities, etc.</li>\n<li>If it's a serious enough project, set up a dedicated web site for it. The web site should provide a feature summary, links to downloads and documentation, and (if applicable) a few screenshots. Make sure it's a proper website, not some ad-ridden cheapo geocities-style abomination - you want to be taken seriously, so act upon it. Adding a news section, a wiki and / or a bug tracker gives potential user an indication how active the project is, which can work for you or against you (if the project is not very active after all).</li>\n<li>If it's an open source project, host it on one of the popular FOSS hubs (github, bitbucket, sourceforge if you have to), and (see above) expose the wiki and the bug tracker (but only if you use them regularly).</li>\n<li>Whatever you do, provide good documentation. You need both a short \"getting started\" and a full reference. If you don't have the first, people will find your program too hard to use. If you don't have the second, people will stop using it because they can't find the information they need.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Being a good programmer does not only rely on programming skills. As you hopefully see during your CS major, programming is only a <strong>subset</strong> of computer science, and most of the people winning prizes (academic prizes at least) will have done so because they proved something new (a new theorem for example), or discovered a new way to achieve some kind of task (design patterns). In order to do so, you need to (at least):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Get a good background in math, it is required to understand algorithmics and hence master the different data structures.</li>\n<li>Understand that a good programmer first understands the paradigms (object-oriented, functional, ...) before being interested by a \"concrete\" language.</li>\n<li>Understand that good programming often also comes for code modelling, and learn the existing design-patterns.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you feel you have already mastered all that, then yes, you will probably impress the community.</p>\n\n<p>You can always try to contribute to an open-source project, but you might be also quite surprised how much you have to catch up before actually being able to contribute.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, have a look around on <a href=\"http://www.stackoverflow.com\">StackOverflow</a> and see how much you can answer there in your favorite language... you'll have a good proxy of your level.</p>\n",
            " <ol>\n<li>Learn as much as you can.  This can be done by books, forums, classes, but most importantly by actually programming (and getting critiqued).  If you've outgrown the programming classes at your high school, see if a local (community) college has any good CS classes that you can take (maybe over a summer or as a night class); or try taking open course ware from MIT/Stanford types.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate initiative.  Saying you know C++ will be totally disregarded.  Saying you have dozens of commits to a list of open source projects demonstrates you know something, etc (though be careful; don't just commit for the sake of committing).  Start your own open source projects.  This isn't going to be something you do in an afternoon; but something that becomes your baby over a period of months.  Write and publish an android/iphone app that does something useful and gets people to download it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>PS: Its been a long time since I've applied to college -- they still give you an opportunity to list things like this, right?  (E.g., a section about hobbies, or a essay question about your interests).</p>\n",
            " <p>I am a freelance programmer.  Programming has been my primary income since I have graduated high school 9 years ago.  I still intend to get my degree, but at the moment the time still isn't right for me.</p>\n\n<p>My path to self driven recognition was as follows.  I'm not saying that these steps will make you recognized by the programming community, but it will help increase your credibility when it comes time to interview.</p>\n\n<p>Even after I was fairly versed in programming IMO at the time, I went back to the basics and went through tutorials and built myself a portfolio based on inspired works from those.  I also began to force myself to comment my code in a JavaDoc-esque fashion.  The portfolio may not be filled with glitz and glamour right now, but it gives you a baseline that you can build off of and eventually replace what you have in there.  I then had a set of demos and code samples to show to prospective clients.  This is essential in getting your first job.  Nobody wants to hire someone that doesn't have any experience, however, there are a number of individuals who will give a chance to a promising looking programmer that doesn't have professional experience.</p>\n\n<p>I later analyzed these programs and began to write libraries based on my commonly used tasks.  With my new libraries I began looking at CompSci problems on the internet and began timing myself on how long it would take me to build a solution with my libraries.  This would give me a baseline in the future as to what I should charge for a specific task.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn't until then that I had discovered open source.  I looked through the projects on sourceforge in the language I was interested in and found applications I could make use of.  I installed these applications and began using them as a part of my every day computing experience.  I was able to see the strengths and weaknesses of these applications as far as my every day interaction was and I began to extend them to suit my needs.  I would submit my patches to the community developing to be reviewed, and after a few I would apply to become a member of the project.  This is where I learned to use the different tools used when working in a team that took my \"vast experience\", as I considered it at the time, and took it to the next level.</p>\n\n<p>I adapted all of my practices that I had picked up working on open source projects and implemented comprable solutions when I was working as an individual.  I began seriously pursuing a career as a freelance developer and joined a number of freelance recruitment sites.  I looked at what the popular jobs were, and began applying.  For every job that I would get turned down, I would still complete it for myself as if I had obtained the job to expand my knowledge.  This would help build my portfolio and introduce me to some real world challenges.  When I finally did get that first interview I was straightforward, told them that I didn't have any professional experience.  I then began to tell them the open source projects that I had worked on, what I had accomplished there.  Some major hurdles I had come across, and how I addressed them.  I was able to offer a portfolio of working applications and example code based on my experience as an amateur, and they took in all of the information and provided me with the opportunity to step in to the freelance world.</p>\n",

The only way to get better at coding, is to code - and what better way to do that, than to solve current problems.

They can get the job done... sort of.. in a minimal sense, but have little ideas of concepts such as design patters, maintainability, robust/defensive coding, algorithms/data-structures and other things that like efficient use of source control software. They have the ability to effectively read documentation and use most APIs.</li>\n<li>\"Average Electrical Engineer\" - 80% Electrical, 10% computer science, 10% software engineer.\nProficiency with electronics, but just about as much programming as the typical \"programmer\". Logic and critical thinking, and management skills from the electrical side will help though.</li>\n<li>\"Average Computer science BS graduate\" - 25% programmer, 25% software engineer, 25% computer scientist, 25% applied electronics (logic included). </li>\n<li>\"Average Computer Engineer\" - These people are a mix of 50% electrical engineer, 50% computer science graduate.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Definitions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\"Computer Science\" - Dijkstra once stated: \"Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.\" Computer Science is more about math than it is about computers. This includes the ability to develop, understand, and classify complex algorithms and data structures. </li>\n<li>\"Software Engineering\" - Design Pattern, diagrams representing programs (I can't remember what these are called). stuff like that. Defensive coding.. Source control use, </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Notice, I used the word \"Average\" above. Depending on personal interests and job experience, these percentages can change drastically.\nThese are just over-generalized stereotypes.

            " <p>I have a slightly different viewpoint here. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to get your software noticed, the best way is to have people using it. Although Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg were great young programmers, there were lots of better programmers. But these two gentlemen got lots of people to use their products and are therefore better known for their work. </p>\n\n<p>To get people to use your code you could:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sell your product to lots of people. For example put up a mobile app at an app store and track downloads, purchases and continuing usage. </li>\n<li>Get lots of people to use your product, and make advertising revenue. </li>\n<li>Get lots of developers to develop products which work with your product. This is hard. </li>\n<li>Contribute to a popular open-source project so that your contributions will be used by lots of people. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In my opinion, software is almost irrelevant without providing benefit to users. And you will get noticed for solving problems which people care about, and that is a very rare skill. </p>\n",
            " <p>If you want to get noticed AND make some money I would recommend mobile development on iPhone or Android.  You already know C++, which is a great start.  For native development on iPhone you'll need Objective C, and for Android you'll need Java.  Both are similar to C++ (Java is easier since there's not memory management), and will not be too difficult to learn.  So not only will you write applications that will get you noticed, and make you some money, but you will learn new languages and hot platforms in the process.</p>\n",

So you can go on the jQueryUI developer forum on the jQuery site and ask to be a contributor.</p></li>\n<li><p>I think you will be demonstrating great passion and dedication for programming more than you will be demonstrating great skill. But don't let that stop you!  I strongly encourage you to be involved.</p></li>\n<li><p>At this point you might have to settle for doing QA.  QA is boring but you can accept it and show dedication.

Just look for a project where the people are encouraging and nice.</p></li>\n<li><p>After you find a project with encouraging, nice people and you contribute, you can ask one of the adult contributors or hopefully one of the people in charge of the project to write you a short letter of recommendation.</p></li>\n</ul>\n",
            " <p>Build a web app that works well on the iPhone and Android (ignore standard browsers for now) and take advantage of HTML5's extended features (https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/HTML5) to overcome latency, spotty network, and the limitation of phone browsers. This most likely means delivering a javascript+html5  browser app that connects to a server-based api. (pick xmlrpc/json/yaml, not SOAP). make it screaming fast. On the server, I recommend using cherrypy in linux (debian) on cheap VPS. You can get some at 123systems.com, buyvm.net (preferred but often not available) for under $4 a month. Learn to use Python, and use Fabric to deploy your stuff to your server(s). Get a .info domain at namecheap.com for $2.99 a year, and use dnsmadeasy.com for DNS (more expensive, but worth it-- been using them for years, never had a single issue) where you can do load-balance via DNS. Also, don't be put off by databases. Use sqlite and learn to design your tables manually with sql statements. Finally, with one machine you can probably handle 30,000 users. (2,000 simultaneously at one hit to server every 3 seconds). Remember to cache as much as possible in HTML5's storage. </p>\n\n<p>If you do this, and you blog about it and twit about the blog entries and your progress, you will definitely get noticed. Granted there's a lot to learn, but you can do it!</p>\n",

You'll often find that to improve one you'll need to improve the others as you go, make sure to embrace this rather than fight it by trying to learn one well before diving into the others. Taking the all at once approach will also help you be more flexible when you move on to bigger things.</p>\n\n<p>You will find that most of your problems and the areas with the most value is on the boundaries between each of these, an AJAX call to update a widget for instance will involve all of JS, CSS, HTML DOM, server-side and probably SQL.

Production support are getting reports of issues, fixing them on the fly and reporting back to their users at the moment.  This needs to be changed but I don't really want to have a sperate system for tracking bugs and tracking dev work.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way that I can create a very light weight way of entering bugs into TFS similar to the way that FogBugz does?  Logging into TFS to fill out a bug report seems to be a lot heavier and you have to associate it with a particular application.  Support may be able to do this but I want to be able to triage the item and potentially change the association to something other than an application.</p>\n\n<p>I have used FogBugz in the past and when adding a bug, you can add a much/little as you want to the item so it is at least recorded and later you can bounce it back to get more information when you come to triage the ticket.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

They can also generate all kinds of reports to look at the status of things.</p>\n\n<p>The types of work items available and the fields in the work items vary depending on how TFS is configured (primarily by which process templates were chosen).  </p>\n\n<p>The information required to enter a bug is also dependent on how you have TFS configured.  In our case, we require a title, steps to reproduce, and the build that it was found in.  The TFS work item tracking system is very powerful and flexible.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Consider the following &quot;if cast&quot;:</p>\n<pre><code>class A     { public void f1() { ... } }\nclass B : A { public void f2() { ... } }\n\nA a = foo(); // might return A or B\n\nif ( a is B ) {\n    //  Inside block, implicitly &quot;redeclare&quot; a as type B\n    //  It's B, go for it\n    a.f2();\n    //  Wouldn't compile.\n    a = new A();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We don't enter the block unless <code>a</code> is a <code>B</code>, therefore within the block, the compiler treats <code>a</code> exactly as if it had been declared as type <code>B</code>. You could assign null to it in the block if it's a reference type, but it would be a compile-time error to assign <code>new A()</code> to it, for example (thanks @ThomasEding for bringing up that question).</p>\n<p>Anything that could break that assumption that <code>a</code> is <code>B</code>, could just as easily break the following legal C# as well:</p>\n<pre><code>if ( a is B ) {\n    B b = a as B;\n\n    b.f2();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The former looks to me like syntactic sugar for the latter.</p>\n<p>Even if this feature makes sense, I'm sure Anders Hjelberg's lads have more useful features to implement. I'm just wondering if it's a worse idea than I think it is.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> A serious objection would be that the feature as described adds semantics without adding syntax: From one version of the language to the next, the meaning of the above block would change significantly. It would be more tolerable with a new keyword. But then you'd be adding a new keyword.</p>\n<h2>Update</h2>\n<p>A more redable version of this feature was implemented in C#7:</p>\n<pre><code>object object2 = new List&lt;Test&gt;();\n\nif (object2 is Dictionary&lt;String, int&gt; foo)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(foo.Keys);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>It's not that it's a bad idea, it's just that there's no point in elevating this to the point of language feature, not even syntactic sugar, you can very easily implement this yourself in C#:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static class ExtensionMethods\n{\n    public static void AsIf&lt;T&gt;(this object target, Action&lt;T&gt; todo)\n    {\n        if (target is T) todo((T)target);\n    }\n}\n\na.AsIf(aAsB =&gt; {your code});\n</code></pre>\n",

(Probably OK)\n    a.BMethod(); // Disallow? (Probably OK)\n    a = new A(); // Disallow? (Probably bad)\n    a.BMethod(); // Disallow?\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It certainly is possible to write your extension to fail to compile in such a case, but one would want clean error messages, need to define more restrictions (such as you could only assign a <code>B</code> to <code>a</code> inside the if-block), throw a runtime exception, or something else.</p>\n\n<p>Consider multi-threaded code using <code>a</code>, and <code>a</code> gets reassigned inside the as-if block. This would be very hard to do properly in a direct C# translation (it's possible, but not very nice *). This feature wants to be done at the byte code level, where it is trivial to implement.</p>\n\n<p>(*): You would need to assign to a temporary, then assign to the original <code>a</code>, then assign to the <code>a_as_b</code> compiler generated variable. Even still, I may be missing some important edge cases.</p>\n",
            " <p>Let's assume features start with 0 points, rather than with <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/ericgu/minus-100-points\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">-100 points</a> (due to costs associated with implementation, design, etc.).</p>\n<p>This feature strikes me as confusing.  I've already declared that a is an A.  If I want to know the compile-time type of a, I only have to look in one place, at the declaration.  While I acknowledge that the implementation is relatively simple (use the code substitution you describe in your question), this also argues in favor of not implementing the feature; it's easy for coders to do it, too.</p>\n<p>The truly horrifying thing is that the type of a variable can magically change immediately after a <code>}</code>.  C# very deliberately prevents this from happening (see <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/ericlippert/simple-names-are-not-so-simple\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Simple names are not so simple</a>).

            " <p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Concurrency Issues</p>\n\n<p>When you write <code>A a;</code> you are effectively making the statement \"<code>a</code> is a variable that can contain objects representable by the type <code>A</code>\". By changing the variable's type to something lower in the food chain, you would potentially introduce concurrency issues.</p>\n\n<p>For example</p>\n\n<pre><code>namespace AsIf\n{\nclass A { public void FA() {} }\nclass B : A { public void FB() {} }\nclass C : A { public void FC() {} }\n\nclass Program\n{\ndelegate void ActionOnA(ref A a);\nstatic void AToC(ref A a) { Thread.Sleep(5000); a = new C(); }\n\nvoid main()\n{\nA a = new B();\n\n// Wait 5 seconds, change a to new C()\nActionOnA action = AToC;\naction.BeginInvoke(ref a, (ar) =&gt; { action.EndInvoke(ref a, ar); }, null);\n\nif(a is B)\n{\n// a is implicitly retyped as B for the rest of this block\n\n// B.FB get called on a (an instance of B)\na.FB();\n// Sleep 6 seconds\nThread.Sleep(6000);\n// B.FB gets called on a (an instance of C)\na.FB();\n// 'Undefined behaviour' most likely causing all kinds of crazy\n}\n}\n}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is slightly less likely to happen when you introduce <code>b</code> </p>\n\n<pre><code>// assume everything else is as before\n\nvoid main()\n{\nA a = new B();\n\n// Wait 5 seconds, change a to new C()\nActionOnA action = AToC;\naction.BeginInvoke(ref a, (ar) =&gt; { action.EndInvoke(ref a, ar); }, null);\n\nif(a is B)\n{\n// introduce b\nB b = (B)a;\n\n// B.FB get called on b (an instance of B)\nb.FB();\n// Sleep 6 seconds\nThread.Sleep(6000);\n// B.FB gets called on b (an instance of B)\nb.FB();\n// Safe! (for now)\n}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is because <code>B</code> is an entirely different variable being used to hold the same object.\nWhat the concurrent function is actually doing is assigning to the variable a which is not directly affecting the object a was holding. Because b now holds a reference to the object that was in <code>a</code>, a can get reassigned and nobody would care.</p>\n\n<p>Of course this is an implementation detail. If the compiler were to secretly create a second variable for the <code>asif</code> block rather than just reinterpreting a as being of the type <code>B</code>, the result would be effectively the same as my second example. Whether such behaviour is expected, obvious or desired is a different matter entirely.</p>\n\n<p>It's not an impossible feature, it's just one that's more work than it's worth really.</p>\n",

For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void switchOnEnumTypes(Foo|Bar|Baz var) {\n    switch(var)\n    case (is Foo) {\n        print(\"FOO\");\n    }\n    case (is Bar) {\n        print(\"BAR\");\n    }\n    case (is Baz) {\n        print(\"BAZ\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1 - Actually, it requires this, since Ceylon doesn't have an explicit type-cast.

            " <p>This is already a common feature in many programming languages. They are called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union\" rel=\"nofollow\">sum types</a>. Classes are an awkward way to simulate sum types in languages that lack them.</p>\n\n<p>Sum types (also called <em>variants</em> and <em>unions</em>)  are the dual to product types (commonly called <em>tuples</em>).  Just as product types allow you to stick to types together to create a compound type that is composed of type 1 and type 2, sum types allow you to create a compound type that is <em>either</em> type 1 <em>or</em> type 2.</p>\n\n<p>Here's how it works. Let's say we want to represent internet addresses. There are two ways to address a computer on the internet: using its IP address or its fully-qualified domain name (FQDN). The FQDN is a human-readable string, while the IP address is an integer between 0 and 2^32. </p>\n\n<p>Since we want functions that can operate on either of these schemes, we create a sum type</p>\n\n<pre><code>type InternetAddress = IP of int | FQDN of string\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that <code>InternetAddress</code> is really just a type alias for <code>int + string</code>. The identifiers <code>IP</code> and <code>FQDN</code> serve as labels (also called <em>constructors</em> or <em>injections</em>) for each \"branch\".</p>\n\n<p>To create a value of type <code>InternetAddress</code>, we <em>inject</em> a value into the sum type</p>\n\n<pre><code>val my_address: InternetAddress = FQDN \"mydomain.com\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To use a value of a sum type, we perform case analysis. The instance type of the value determines which \"branch\" of the expression we take:</p>\n\n<pre><code>case my_address of\n     IP ip_address -&gt; *branch 1*\n     | FQDN host_name -&gt; *branch 2*\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In either branch, the underlying value of <code>my_address</code> binds to the declared variable. So in branch 1, we can use <code>ip_address</code> which has type <code>int</code>, and in branch 2 we can use <code>host_name</code> which has type <code>string</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, sum types are an indispensable feature of programming languages, and the fact that they are so scarce in today's mainstream languages has caused considerable confusion and errors over the years.</p>\n",
            " <p>In Swift you write:</p>\n<pre><code>if let b = a as? B {\n    ....\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>a as B</code> would try to convert <code>a</code> to type <code>B</code> - which for object types would succeed if a actually belongs to class <code>B</code> which would need to be a subclass or superclass of <code>A</code> to ever succeed. Of course this would only change the type of the reference, not the type of the object behind it. And it would crash on purpose if the conversion fails.</p>\n<p><code>a as? B</code> is similar except it returns an &quot;optional B&quot;; the result is <code>nil</code> if the conversion fails.</p>\n<p><code>if let b = a as? B</code> evaluates <code>a as? B</code>. If the result is <code>nil</code> then the if is not executed. If the result is not <code>nil</code> then it assigns the reference to a non-optional <code>b</code> of type <code>B</code> and executes the <code>if</code>'s body.</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Exception handling in C++ is limited to try/throw/catch. Unlike Object Pascal, Java, C# and Python, even in C++ 11, the <code>finally</code> construct has not been implemented.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen an awful lot of C++ literature discussing \"exception safe code\". Lippman writes that exception safe code is an important but advanced, difficult topic, beyond the scope of his Primer - which seems to imply that safe code is not fundamental to C++. Herb Sutter devotes 10 chapters to the topic in his Exceptional C++ !</p>\n\n<p>Yet it seems to me that many of the problems encountered when attempting to write \"exception safe code\" could be quite well solved if the <code>finally</code> construct was implemented, allowing the programmer to ensure that even in the event of an exception, the program can be restored to a safe, stable, leak-free state, close to the point of allocation of resources and potentially problematic code. As a very experienced Delphi and C# programmer I use try.. finally blocks quite extensively in my code, as do most programmers in these languages.</p>\n\n<p>Considering all the 'bells and whistles' implemented in C++ 11, I was astonished to find that 'finally' was still not there.</p>\n\n<p>So, why has the <code>finally</code> construct never been implemented in C++? It's really not a very difficult or advanced concept to grasp and goes a long ways towards helping the programmer to write 'exception safe code'. </p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

The basic idea is to represent a resource by a local object, so that the local object's destructor will release the resource. That way, the programmer cannot forget to release the resource.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
            " <p>The reason that C++ does not have <code>finally</code> is because it is not needed in C++.\n<code>finally</code> is used to execute some code regardless of whether an exception has occurred or not, which almost always is some kind of cleanup code. In C++, this cleanup code should be in the destructor of the relevant class and the destructor will always be called, just like a <code>finally</code> block.\nThe idiom of using the destructor for your cleanup is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAII\">RAII</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Within the C++ community there might be more talk about 'exception safe' code, but it is almost equally important in other languages that have exceptions. The whole point of 'exception safe' code is that you think about in what state your code gets left if an exception occurs in any of the functions/methods that you call.<br/>\nIn C++, 'exception safe' code is slightly more important, because C++ does not have automatic garbage collection that takes care of objects that are left orphaned due to an exception.</p>\n\n<p>The reason the exception safety is discussed more in the C++ community probably also stems from the fact that in C++ you have to be more aware of what can go wrong, because there are fewer default safety nets in the language.</p>\n",
            " <p>It's really just a matter of understanding the philosophy and idioms of C++.  Take your example of an operation that opens a database connection on a persistent class and has to make sure that it closes that connection if an exception is thrown.  This is a matter of exception safety and applies to any language with exceptions (C++, C#, Delphi...).</p>\n\n<p>In a language that uses <code>try</code> / <code>finally</code>, the code might look something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>database.Open();\ntry {\n    database.DoRiskyOperation();\n} finally {\n    database.Close();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Simple and straightforward.  There are, however, a few disadvantages:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If the language doesn't have deterministic destructors, I <em>always have</em> to write the <code>finally</code> block, otherwise I leak resources.</li>\n<li>If <code>DoRiskyOperation</code> is more than a single method call - if I have some processing to do in the <code>try</code> block - then the <code>Close</code> operation can end up being a decent bit away from the <code>Open</code> operation.  I can't write my cleanup right next to my acquisition.</li>\n<li>If I have several resources that need to be acquired then freed in an exception-safe manner, I can end up with several layers deep of <code>try</code> / <code>finally</code> blocks.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The C++ approach would look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ScopedDatabaseConnection scoped_connection(database);\ndatabase.DoRiskyOperation();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This completely solves all of the disadvantages of the <code>finally</code> approach.  It has a couple of disadvantages of its own, but they're relatively minor:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There's a good chance you need to write the <code>ScopedDatabaseConnection</code> class yourself.  However, it's a very simple implementation - only 4 or 5 lines of code.</li>\n<li>It involves creating an extra local variable - which you're apparently not a fan of, based on your comment about \"constantly creating and destroying classes to rely on their destructors to clean up your mess is very poor\" - but a good compiler will optimize out any of the extra work that an extra local variable involves.  Good C++ design relies a lot on these sorts of optimizations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Personally, considering these advantages and disadvantages, I find RAII <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)</a> a much preferable technique to <code>finally</code>.  Your mileage may vary.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, because RAII is such a well-established idiom in C++, and to relieve developers of some of the burden of writing numerous <code>Scoped...</code> classes, there are libraries like <a href=\"http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/generic-change-the-way-you-write-excepti/184403758\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ScopeGuard</a> and <a href=\"http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/scope_exit/doc/html/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Boost.ScopeExit</a> that facilitate this sort of deterministic cleanup.</p>\n",

            " <p>Others have discussed RAII as the solution. It's a perfectly good solution. But that doesn't really address <em>why</em> they didn't add <code>finally</code> as well since it's a widely desired thing. The answer to that is more fundamental to the design and development of C++: throughout the development of C++ those involved have strongly resisted the introduction of design features that can be achieved using other features without a huge amount of fuss and especially where this requires the introduction of new keywords that could render older code incompatible. Since RAII provides a highly functional alternative to <code>finally</code> and you can actually roll your own <code>finally</code> in C++11 anyway, there was little call for it.</p>\n\n<p>All you need to do is create a class <code>Finally</code> that calls the function passed to it's constructor in it's destructor. Then you can do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>try\n{\n    Finally atEnd([&amp;] () { database.close(); });\n\n    database.doRisky();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Most native C++ programmers will, in general, prefer cleanly designed RAII objects however.</p>\n",
            " <p>Well, you could sort of roll-your-own <code>finally</code>, using Lambdas, which would get the following to compile fine (using an example without RAII of course, not the nicest piece of code):</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n    FILE *file = fopen(\"test\",\"w\");\n\n    finally close_the_file([&amp;]{\n        cout &lt;&lt; \"We're closing the file in a pseudo-finally clause.\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n        fclose(file);\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/476970/finally-clause-in-Cplusplus\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a>.</p>\n",
            " <p>I'm not sure I agree with assertions here that RAII is a superset of <code>finally</code>.  The achilles heel of RAII is simple: exceptions.  RAII is implemented with destructors, and it's always wrong in C++ to throw out of a destructor.  That means that you cannot use RAII when you need your cleanup code to throw.  If <code>finally</code> were implemented, on the other hand, there's no reason to believe that it would not be legal to throw from a <code>finally</code> block.</p>\n\n<p>Consider a code path like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void foo() {\n    try {\n        ... stuff ...\n        complex_cleanup();\n    } catch (A&amp; a) {\n        handle_a(a);\n        complex_cleanup();\n        throw;\n    } catch (B&amp; b) {\n        handle_b(b);\n        complex_cleanup();\n        throw;\n    } catch (...) {\n        handle_generic();\n        complex_cleanup();\n        throw;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If we had <code>finally</code> we could write:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void foo() {\n    try {\n        ... stuff ...\n    } catch (A&amp; a) {\n        handle_a(a);\n        throw;\n    } catch (B&amp; b) {\n        handle_b(b);\n        throw;\n    } catch (...) {\n        handle_generic();\n        throw;\n    } finally {\n        complex_cleanup();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But there is no way, that I can find, to get the equivalent behavior using RAII.</p>\n\n<p>If someone knows how to do this in C++, I'm very interested in the answer.

Your mileage may vary.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, because RAII is such a well-established idiom in C++, and to relieve developers of some of the burden of writing numerous <code>Scoped...</code> classes, there are libraries like <a href=\"http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/generic-change-the-way-you-write-excepti/184403758\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ScopeGuard</a> and <a href=\"http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/scope_exit/doc/html/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Boost.ScopeExit</a> that facilitate this sort of deterministic cleanup.</p>\n",
        "rejected_target": " <p>I'm not sure I agree with assertions here that RAII is a superset of <code>finally</code>.  The achilles heel of RAII is simple: exceptions.  RAII is implemented with destructors, and it's always wrong in C++ to throw out of a destructor.  That means that you cannot use RAII when you need your cleanup code to throw.  If <code>finally</code> were implemented, on the other hand, there's no reason to believe that it would not be legal to throw from a <code>finally</code> block.</p>\n\n<p>Consider a code path like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void foo() {\n    try {\n        ... stuff ...\n        complex_cleanup();\n    } catch (A&amp; a) {\n        handle_a(a);\n        complex_cleanup();\n        throw;\n    } catch (B&amp; b) {\n        handle_b(b);\n        complex_cleanup();\n        throw;\n    } catch (...) {\n        handle_generic();\n        complex_cleanup();\n        throw;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If we had <code>finally</code> we could write:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void foo() {\n    try {\n        ... stuff ...\n    } catch (A&amp; a) {\n        handle_a(a);\n        throw;\n    } catch (B&amp; b) {\n        handle_b(b);\n        throw;\n    } catch (...) {\n        handle_generic();\n        throw;\n    } finally {\n        complex_cleanup();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But there is no way, that I can find, to get the equivalent behavior using RAII.</p>\n\n<p>If someone knows how to do this in C++, I'm very interested in the answer.  I'd even be happy with something that relied on, for example, enforcing that all exceptions inherited from a single class with some special capabilities or something.</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Several times in my career, I've encountered situations where the business has a technical problem, and I have the previous experience and skills necessary to resolve the issue.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of being trusted to solve the issue, these companies have typically hired (expensive) external consultants to come in and \"save us\". Their theory being \"they're paid to work in that area, so they must be experts\"...</p>\n\n<p>In each case, I've already presented my understanding of the problem and my proposed solution. Each and every time, the consultants produce a report that supports my conclusions (but often goes into less detail - as I've had the advantage of examining the original issue over more time).</p>\n\n<p>Then, what usually happens is that I've gained some \"business credibility\" in subject \"A\", but if a problem ever occurs with topic \"B\" it'll be the same uphill battle all over again.</p>\n\n<p>I've also seen attitudes resembling:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"We don't know, so you can't know.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If they've had an issue for months or years, then you join and suggest something they haven't tried, there's almost a willful refusal to consider the possibility.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The consultants are employed by the vendor/OEM, so they must know.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even when it's a relatively trivial issue, they'll assume they need an oracle on the subject (thinking along the lines of \"we have a Java issue, James Gosling must be the only person able to help us\").</p>\n\n<p>Now, I'd hope that I have a reasonably realistic assessment of my own abilities (or lack thereof), so when there's a problem outside of my \"domain\" I'll just do everything possible to stay out of the way and absorb the knowledge demonstrated by whoever gets tasked with resolving it (basically, I don't pretend to know what I don't know about). </p>\n\n<p><strong>How can I convince my employer that I have the level of competence they require when it's in an area where they lack the expertise to assess competence?</strong> </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>A few people commenting and answering have missed a nuance to my question. The people I'm working with are not incompetent in general (quite the opposite in fact), they simply lack competence <strong>for a given skill</strong> - usually on a rare topic.</p>\n\n<p>This means I do not patronize, talk down to them or speak to them with any disdain or disrespect (as some answerers have assumed). In fact, when the topic is in an area they have a degree of familiarity with, I find it very easy to get \"buy-in\" and support for my ideas. The only time I encounter any issues is when they lack the tools to assess my competence in a skill they lack themselves.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>The best way to prevent the race for a consultant is present a convincing business case that doesn't include a consultant.  From the business cases I've developed the main points are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Thoroughly define the problem being solved - Do not include your solution within the problem definition.  Concisely state the problem in business terms rather than technical terms.  For example \"Based on submitted bug reports customers find feature X confusing.  This confusion leads to frustration and reduces engagement in the overall product.\" is much better than \"The UI of feature X is flawed in these ways...\" because it states the problem in terms of business value.  In terms of solution ownership this shows that you understand the issue from a business perspective which is key since this is the same perspective that the decision makers will be looking from.  This will get everyone on the same page as to what the problem is from a high level.</li>\n<li>State your solution along with several other possible plans of\naction including the null case of doing nothing and state the\ncosts/benefits for each. For the above example I would go through\ndoing nothing, scrapping feature X, improving user training/help\ndocuments, reworking the UI on feature X.  This shows that you have\nlooked at the issue from several sides rather than immediately\nhopping onto your pet solution to the exclusion of all others.</li>\n<li>Show how you can effectively test if your solution eliminates the\nproblem.  This is huge in selling non-technical people on technical\nsolutions.  They want assurance that their investment is working so\nif you can give them concrete parameters and a way to measure\nsuccess.  If the definition of success is murky it is\npsychologically much harder to buy in to an idea.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My best real world example regarding going to a consultant is imagine you go to a mechanic for routine inspection.  If you hear \"Your garbles are cracked.  It's $800 to change them out.  Should I go ahead with that?\"  you are not going to be very confident in your ability to know if your money is being well spent and you may get a second opinion.  If you hear \"Your garbles are slightly cracked which could lead to your steering failing if you hit a pothole.  We could wait and see but that's risky.  I could weld across the crack for $500 but I wouldn't trust it long run.  It would be $800 to swap them out.  Swapping them out is the only way we can be sure they will hold.  What do you want me to do?\" you are going to feel more empowered to make a good decision even if the ultimate decision is the same.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note in a lot of places you are going to be fighting the culture to make headway on this.  Don't take it personally if the default answer is consultancy, just continue to work on your sales skills for selling your ideas to management.  When a decision goes against you on this remember that you may be missing pieces of the bigger picture (ie cost of failure may be higher than it generally appears due to interdependencies) or the opportunity cost for you doing this project rather than something else might be too high.</p>\n",
            " <p>I've seen the same type of issue in my own past.  As noted by Myles part of the issue might be a communication problem. Often, people will not necessarily understand a technical person's description of a problem or the appropriate solution. Graphs, pictures and external supporting references sometimes confer some comfort to the reader.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of your communication skills I suggest there is a very difficult to overcome reason for such behavior as a company grows. Higher level people who are making decisions often abhor making a decision that they can be held directly accountable for.

            " <p>I wonder why you oppose bringing in consultants if the end results is that something gets implemented that is just what you would have suggested, especially when afterwards everyone agrees that you totally did know what the right course of action was. Is it that you would have liked to get recognition in advance that your idea was right? Is it that you think the company is wasting money paying consultants for advice they could have had for free?</p>\n\n<p>Those external consultants (and yes, quite often I am one of them) bring a lot more into the group than the idea of what to do to get your problem solved. They bring external authority and expertise, which often sways other participants into changing their ways, far more so than a logical explanation of why a particular course of action is right. They bring a convenient scapegoat also - if someone changes how they do things because a colleague or peer said to, and it goes bad, the blame will be on the changer, but if someone changes how they do things because a highly paid external consultant said to, and it goes bad, the blame will be on the consultant. They also demonstrate, by the sheer money that is being spent on them, that management is truly committed to making this change.</p>\n\n<p>I can't tell you how many times someone has told me \"that recommendation you made today, that they've all agreed to and are starting to do? I argued for that a month ago and nobody would listen.\" I reassure them that this is a widespread phenomenon that <strong>does not</strong> (and here's where I start to actually answer your question) <strong>reflect management's actual opinion of their skill level.</strong> Let me say that again. The reason people don't take your advice, and then later take that very same advice from a paid external consultant, is <strong>not</strong> because they think you are less skilled than you are or your advice is less valuable than it is. </p>\n\n<p>Go ahead and put a little effort into showing you can solve it yourself. If they don't listen (and they probably won't) make sure you get a chance to work closely with the consultants. You can tell them what you know, which will improve the quality of the solution, you may (or may not) learn from them, and when the project succeeds you will be associated with the success. Don't get worked up about the possibility that silly old management is incapable of understanding how good you are or how simple their technical problems are. You may be right, but often there is more to a technical problem than a technical solution.</p>\n",
            " <p>My problem with the question is that it assumes the person who made the choice to hire a consultant is incompetent.  I do not think the Dunning-Kruger failure effect is the real or only reason why you are not successful in your attempts to convince people not to use consultants when you have the available skills. And really what do you gain by assuming that other people are falling into the Dunning-Kruger effect? Does this help you be effective at work in any way?  Why are you even thinking about it? It actually prevents you from seeing what you can do to improve the situation if you are stuck on the idea that other people are incompetent.</p>\n\n<p>First, if your attitude is that they just don't get me and recognize how wonderful I am, then people will pick up that you resent them and be less likely to consult you. So stop even thinking about Dunning-Kruger because it is irrelevant to getting the job done. Your post came across as pretty negative about your managers' incompetence. If I thought that, then there is a good chance that they do too. </p>\n\n<p>Next, there are so many reasons to hire consultants over your own employees to solve problems that have nothing to do with what they think of you. </p>\n\n<p>First you may be highly thought of and they don't think they can spare the time from your regular duties for you to do this.</p>\n\n<p>Second, you may not be presenting your ideas in a way that they understand. Technical people tend to focus on the technical, managers tend to focus on the business need. You have to be talking their language.</p>\n\n<p>Third they may have money in the budget they need to spend or they won't get it next year.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, they may agree with your solution but know it is an easier sell to senior management if it comes from an outside source. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to contribute to change at your organization, you need to first start helping the consultants. It will be noticed that you have contributed if you do this.  Pay attention to how they present the results versus how you did it. Learn how to present ideas like a successful consultant.  </p>\n\n<p>Next don't assume that the people making the decisions are even aware of your skills. Likely anyone beyond your immediate boss doesn't know you already have the skills they are looking for. I've even had bosses who did not know my background if they were not the person who originally hired me and the task was outside the normal duties I did for them. (But if I wanted them to use those skills, I made sure to make sure they knew.) You need to become visible to the higher levels of the organization, see this question for more on this subject:\n<a href=\"https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/11816/why-is-it-important-to-gain-visibility-in-the-workplace\">Why is it important to gain &quot;visibility&quot; in the workplace?</a> </p>\n\n<p>You should welcome the consultants because every time they make the same recommendation you did, then your credibility is increased.</p>\n",
            " <p>Serious problems rarely have one solution nor are they always solved to a specific degree. There is some gray area. Like all engineers, you want to solve problems (which is good), but managers also have to factor in risk.</p>\n\n<p>Consultants can mitigate risk:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>They were highly recommended (i.e. it's not my fault if they screw up)</li>\n<li>They can be contractually held to providing solutions or payment can be withheld where as employees just get fired.</li>\n<li>Consultants can have access to other types of expertise if something unexpected comes up.</li>\n<li>Current Staff may have expertise, but not the time to implement a solution.</li>\n<li>Some managers have previous experience with a particular consultant, so they feel more comfortable with that person. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(Per update to the question) It is safe to assume that people who lack knowledge in an area struggle to identify those who can. It seems like you're able to put together a detailed proposal, but management may be more comfortable if you just get to the point.</p>\n",
            " <p>The empirical evidence says that when you know a good solution you are unable to build group consensus that it is the best way forward. Unless you consistently work for, and with, incompetent people, then the balance of probabilities is that the problem is in your soft skills, specifically with consensus building. This may be a case of Dunning-Kruger but where you are over-estimating your skills in the area of teamwork, consensus building, and stakeholder management. </p>\n\n<p>You state that \"instead of being trusted to solve the issue\" they hire in a consultant. No-one is infallible so taking something on trust is taking a risk. If there is significant potential downside it would be irrational not to minimise risk. It is trivial to eliminate the risk of taking what you say on trust; get a consultant in for a second opinion. A lack of \"soft skills\" and an over focus on the technical aspects of problem solving may be driving them into hiring consultants. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=EQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">high EQ</a> approach is:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Don't bring <em>your</em> solution to the group; bring the group to <em>their</em> solution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Parachuting a solution into a group of stakeholders always risks rejection. People will not have thought through all the avenues you have thought through. They cannot feel comfortable that all the possible alternatives are inferior. The high EQ approach is to talk the solution space over with some key stakeholders one-to-one in advance of any group meetings. This refines your argument and builds support for your recommendations. Go over some possible approaches you have rejected asking whether your rejection reasoning is sound. Then present your favoured solution asking if you have missed any angles, risks or issues. Finally ask them if they can think of any good alternative approaches. Repeat this with a few stakeholders one-to-one until you are sure you have all the angles covered and have perfected your pitch. </p>\n\n<p>Only then hold a group meeting with all stakeholders and take the same approach; go through the alternatives which have been rejected and why. Then pitch your favoured solution and perhaps an alternative someone else has come up with to show you are being open minded and balanced. </p>\n\n<p>Taking such a consensus building approach works for many reasons: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>People feel you have listened and have a fully rounded perspective on all risk and issues.  </li>\n<li>People understand the alternative ideas you have considered and why\nthey are rejected.</li>\n<li>You learn new things about risks and issues of alternative solutions.</li>\n<li>You learn which risks and issues stakeholders are more or less concerned about.   </li>\n<li>Some people you have consulted feel vested in your preferred solution because you have taken time to go over it with them.  </li>\n<li>Some people get more time to consider your solution on two encounters; once when you go over it with them directly and a second time when you bring it to the wider group. If your solution is superior to the alternatives they are likely to be convinced that it is the best way forward. </li>\n<li>You can present the solution as being a group solution by saying things like \"Mary pointed out that X could go wrong which we can cover by doing Y\". </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=EQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Googling \"EQ\"</a> brings up: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For most people, emotional intelligence (EQ) is more important than\n  one's intelligence (IQ) in attaining success in their lives and\n  careers. As individuals our success and the success of the profession\n  today depend on our ability to read other people's signals and react\n  appropriately to them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You should read that people are not persuaded by your approach and are unwilling to simply trust you. The appropriate reaction is to engage with people, learn their concerns, help them to refine the solution, and pitch the solution as owned by the team, not by you. </p>\n",
            " <p>I think you might be missing another aspect of the cost-benefit equation here.</p>\n\n<p>There are quite a few reasons to hire consultants, and one of those is to simply allow for the internal staff to be able to focus on the day to day running of the environment.<br>\nI've come into quite a few shops where the staff knew what the problem was, and had a pretty good idea of the cause or even a solution already planned.</p>\n\n<p>Going into these environments, my main impression is usually that I'm being asked for a plan not because they don't have one, but because <em>they want to compare it with the plan already provided by their internal staff to gauge my competence</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The internal staff is usually required for day to day workings, and are the first stop whenever a problem occurs. While the issue I'm brought in to fix is something that, while often time consuming, is not a recurring action. And as such can easily be handled by an external asset who can be safely let go once the job is done.</p>\n\n<p>Have you actually asked your boss(es) why they prefer hiring consultants for these issues in stead of going with your recommendations?<br>\nIf they are competent managers, the answer might surprise you, and have less to do with their perceived competence of your skills than you think.</p>\n",
            " <p>Catalogue all the times this has happened, get estimates for how much was spent on consultants to come up with solutions (as opposed to implementing them), then go as high as you can in the organisation and ask for a pay raise.</p>\n\n<p>The obvious rule of thumb being used here is \"more expense = more excellence\". If they're paying you more, they'll take you more seriously.</p>\n"

        "sft_target": " <p>The best way to prevent the race for a consultant is present a convincing business case that doesn't include a consultant.  From the business cases I've developed the main points are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Thoroughly define the problem being solved - Do not include your solution within the problem definition.  Concisely state the problem in business terms rather than technical terms.  For example \"Based on submitted bug reports customers find feature X confusing.  This confusion leads to frustration and reduces engagement in the overall product.\" is much better than \"The UI of feature X is flawed in these ways...\" because it states the problem in terms of business value.  In terms of solution ownership this shows that you understand the issue from a business perspective which is key since this is the same perspective that the decision makers will be looking from.  This will get everyone on the same page as to what the problem is from a high level.</li>\n<li>State your solution along with several other possible plans of\naction including the null case of doing nothing and state the\ncosts/benefits for each. For the above example I would go through\ndoing nothing, scrapping feature X, improving user training/help\ndocuments, reworking the UI on feature X.  This shows that you have\nlooked at the issue from several sides rather than immediately\nhopping onto your pet solution to the exclusion of all others.</li>\n<li>Show how you can effectively test if your solution eliminates the\nproblem.  This is huge in selling non-technical people on technical\nsolutions.  They want assurance that their investment is working so\nif you can give them concrete parameters and a way to measure\nsuccess.  If the definition of success is murky it is\npsychologically much harder to buy in to an idea.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My best real world example regarding going to a consultant is imagine you go to a mechanic for routine inspection.  If you hear \"Your garbles are cracked.  It's $800 to change them out.  Should I go ahead with that?\"  you are not going to be very confident in your ability to know if your money is being well spent and you may get a second opinion.  If you hear \"Your garbles are slightly cracked which could lead to your steering failing if you hit a pothole.  We could wait and see but that's risky.  I could weld across the crack for $500 but I wouldn't trust it long run.  It would be $800 to swap them out.  Swapping them out is the only way we can be sure they will hold.  What do you want me to do?\" you are going to feel more empowered to make a good decision even if the ultimate decision is the same.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note in a lot of places you are going to be fighting the culture to make headway on this.  Don't take it personally if the default answer is consultancy, just continue to work on your sales skills for selling your ideas to management.  When a decision goes against you on this remember that you may be missing pieces of the bigger picture (ie cost of failure may be higher than it generally appears due to interdependencies) or the opportunity cost for you doing this project rather than something else might be too high.</p>\n",

She's also frequently volunteering me for tasks, which I find disrespectful, and would never do to her. She's not a bully, she's very nice about her irritating behavior.</p>\n\n<p>I could be wrong, but I feel like my coworker is trying to keep control on what she views as her little kingdom. It seems like she\u2019s afraid she\u2019s getting old and out of the loop, nearing retirement, when I have no desire to kick her off her pedestal, I just want things to be fair. But truth be told, we work in a techie field, and I've stayed up to date as things have changed where I feel that she hasn't, so it's like she puts herself in meetings where she's comfortable playing visionary, and I do all the work she no longer knows how to do.</p>\n\n<p>Any advice on what I should do? She has no plans to retire any time soon, so this could draw on for years. Please help.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>There's (understandably) an emotional side to this question as well as a practical one, but it's the <em>practicalities</em> you need to focus on if you're after a solution. And I'd say that's most neatly summed up by these points:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...the resulting work trickles down to me since she doesn't have time to do it. She's also frequently volunteering me for tasks, which I find disrespectful, and would never do to her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The solution to this <em>could</em> be simple in theory - make sure you have enough work to fill your plate from other tasks, and then push back when she volunteers you for something:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I'm afraid my schedule is full this week as I'm doing <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>, so I'm going to be unable to take that on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Likewise, you can also push back similarly if she tries to assign you tasks on the basis she didn't get a chance to finish them.</p>\n\n<p>However, this is assuming that your boss understands exactly that things are as you say - that you two are entirely equal, and so she's unable to assign you tasks at her sole discretion. It could well be that your boss agrees with her, feels there's an implied hierarchy in place that he wants to keep, and in that case the only real solution is to request a 1 to 1 with your boss and explain the situation is making you unhappy (though again, avoid pointing fingers at your coworker and stick to the practicalities when explaining what's wrong.)</p>\n\n<p>If neither of the above approaches work then, short of just putting up with it, your only real solution could be to look for employment elsewhere.</p>\n",

            " <p>This is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_continuity_planning#Business_continuity\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>business continuity</em></a> issue. Some of the other answers are focusing on how to approach the idea of working from home for yourself, but that isn't the real problem here.</p>\n\n<p>You say your company is a relatively large organisation, and it has in-house IT (you, and your department). Therefore it will have someone in charge of disaster recovery and business continuity already working on this. They have probably done or are currently doing a risk assessment. So far they haven't determined the risk to the business very high, but that might change.</p>\n\n<p>The overall risk is not only to you, or your coworkers, but to the business (and in the wider sense the overall economy). Let's play this through, from the view of the company.</p>\n\n<p>Assume half the staff gets ill. They don't have to be seriously ill, just unable to work. If 250 of 500 people can't go to work, chances are the company will not produce any products or services in that time. SLAs with customers will not be fulfilled, leading to penalty payments. Customers will leave. If there is production, machines need to be stopped, which is costly (think car factory). All the running costs, in particular salaries and buildings and things like this will still have to be paid, but there is no revenue. That means the company will lose money fast. And with its liquidity it will lose the ability to pay your salary. You will lose your job, and the company will fold. </p>\n\n<p>A recent example <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/05/flybe-collapses-as-covid-19-triggers-fall-in-airline-bookings\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">of this already happening is Flybe</a>, where CoVID-19 has been named as something like the last drop (credibility of this source unclear). </p>\n\n<p>Now what does that mean for you? It's hard to say. The risk assessment isn't your job, but you can take precautions.</p>\n\n<p>No-one will blame you for voicing your concerns in this situation, even if that is not part of your job. If you have already got infrastructure in place to work from home, use it. They are likely not going to question you. In particular if your commute involves busy public transport, there are lots of good arguments to not go to work. The main argumentation is not to keep yourself from getting sick, but from spreading the virus (or other illnesses that someone else might contract in addition to the virus because their immune system is weakened) into the office.</p>\n\n<p>My suggestion is to ask your manager about business continuity plans. Looks at what companies around you are doing. If you have a spouse you live with, has their company sent everyone home? These are good arguments to give them.</p>\n\n<p>Your company's business continuity team might be well prepared and currently executing risk mitigation, or it might not. In either case, they will appreciate that some people are aware and conscious of the situation.</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>With StackOverflow and Careers 2.0 it's becoming easier to use the SE network as a professional profile. Yet at the same time there are more and more sites on the SE network, some of which you might not want your employer to know about. Either because they are too personal (like Relationships and Dating) or because, like The Workplace itself, they are actually about your workplace.</p>\n<p>I am wondering if it is more professional to have a &quot;work&quot; set of SE accounts and a &quot;personal&quot; set, or is it not worth troubling to keep them separate? What other factors might you need to consider?</p>\n<p>In particular I am wondering about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how it might affect how you are viewed by potential employers if non-professional SEs are linked to your Careers 2.0 profile</li>\n<li>similarly, how it might affect how you are viewed by current employers</li>\n<li>what other disadvantages there might be to having all questions on the same account that I haven't considered, why they are a disadvantage and how they could be mitigated <em>other</em> than by using two accounts</li>\n<li>if there are any advantages (besides convenience) of having everything on the same account - in particular regarding (though not limited to) professionalism and the workplace</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Thanks everybody who has contributed so far. In light of the answers received so far I would like to make the problem clearer.</h2>\n<p>I would like to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>leave the option open to use Careers 2.0 at some point in the future if I decide it is a good idea, and</li>\n<li>participate fully on the SE network, including some of the less professional sites (as described in first paragraph)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How do I reconcile these two desires?</strong></p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>I think they chose wisely when they decided to call the points tallied in the StackExchange system \"reputation\". Anything you connect with your name will affect your actual reputation. Employers are unlikely to care about the numeric connection, but if/when they read your responses, those responses are going to reflect back on you. Even if you maintain separate accounts, ultimately there is a good chance to slip up and accidentally link them somewhere. Possibly an email address, a cross post, an accidental post, etc. Once they become linked by any of the search engines the exercise of separating the accounts will have proved pointless.</p>\n\n<p>My advice, as someone who interviews software engineers (and I do check them out online), is to remain entirely anonymous for any activity that you don't want publicly associated with your name. However, from the same standpoint, I typically disregard 90% of what I see online regarding a candidate that does not specifically impact their work habits and behaviors. I can understand the desire to keep some things from being related to you in this respect, but I don't think multiple accounts will do you any favors in the long run. </p>\n",

I would be more inclined to only link to professional contacts on LinkedIn and personal contacts on Facebook. Neither of these are going on my resume. If they do a background check/search, I'm comfortable with the information they would access.</p>\n\n<p>The SO Career site is used more like a CV and you would encourage a potential employer to view this information; otherwise, what's the point.

        "responses": [
            " <p>I don't believe you need to disclose it at all if you're at the halfway point (but stay tuned for a comment about the timeline below). Don't give a potential employer a chance at a \"yeah, but...\" in considering your candidacy.</p>\n\n<p>If your partner is halfway, that's 4.5 months. Let's assume you're interviewing today - it's reasonable to estimate 4 -6 weeks before you'd be starting the job (finish interviews, received and consider offer, background checks, 2 weeks notice at the old employer, etc.). That still leaves you employed at the new company for 3-3.5 months before having to take this time off. Unless you're working for unreasonable people, I think that's perfectly adequate to inform them after you have the job secured.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, as you approach the due date this changes, up to the point where one might say \"why are you even interviewing if your new job will start a week before you're having a kid\" you'll have to adjust this, up to the point of saying \"I wouldn't be able to start until after the baby arrives.\" Up to the point where your start date would be one month or less away from the due date, I would suggest that you don't need to disclose at all.</p>\n\n<p>If you carry the health insurance for your family, a change of jobs can become tricky with the change of insurance provider. Lots of paperwork and chances for things to get missed.</p>\n\n<p>With everything else that can go on around having a child, I would recommend putting interviews on hiatus starting about a month before the due date to prevent confusion and scheduling conflicts around the birth.</p>\n",

Some laws <em>might</em> enforce you to tell them about your current health status, but that's about how far it should go. If in doubt, and note that I'm not a lawyer, contact your union or consult with a lawyer.</p>\n\n<p>Employees often fill out forms to notify their employer that they're expecting. If you don't do this and they find out before you do tell them they can fire you without you doing anything about it, it's unlikely but a possibility. Likewise telling them about the pregnancy right now, instead of waiting and turning in the form like everyone else, is probably a suicide for your application-process.</p>\n\n<p>It could be ethically wrong on your behalf to accept a job knowing that you'll be away for quite some time if you know that they'll be unable to function during the time you think you won't be available.

Let's assume you're interviewing today - it's reasonable to estimate 4 -6 weeks before you'd be starting the job (finish interviews, received and consider offer, background checks, 2 weeks notice at the old employer, etc.).

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I've been having horrible luck with job interviews. I have been to many - my resume is great - but just never get the job. </p>\n\n<p>Recently I spoke with a doctor and he put me on the autism spectrum. It's not a big thing, but it involves me having trouble speaking with new people, making eye contact, etc. </p>\n\n<p>I believe the two things may be related. Is this something that I can and should mention during an interview, or does this look bad? (i.e \"You might not get a good first impression, but don't worry!\"). How can I convey this in a professional manner?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>EDIT (since my original answer may already be irrelevant):</p>\n\n<p>Since you seem to be a newcomer to the job market as Anketam correctly guessed. It could just be that you're blowing things out of proportion and psyching yourself out simply because you're not used to rejection.   </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have been to many - my resume is great - but just never get the job.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Job-hunting is a numbers game. That's why it's important to never to use absolute quantifiers like \"never\" or \"always\", and never use vague evasive words like \"many\" when assessing your behavior. </p>\n\n<p>The truth is that you have to treat job-hunting like a real job and that entails using real numbers. Also, it's a fact that rejection doesn't feel good (not just for you, but for everybody), and that our minds are trying to blow that feeling out of proportion so to avoid getting more rejections in the future. </p>\n\n<p>ORIGINAL ANSWER (which may no longer be relevant):</p>\n\n<p>What you're suggesting would go against conventional wisdom, but assuming the job you're looking for is software-related or math-related, and is non-managerial, it may be worth a shot mentioning it. </p>\n\n<p>But I would be very careful with that. Going against conventions is risky. And if you do this, you should try <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\" rel=\"nofollow\">AB testing</a> it. </p>\n\n<p>Just note that in the US, HR departments would try to censor that information out of any resume/cover letter you write, or out of any preliminary interview you take with them, so if you do this, you'll want to mention it to the hiring manager during the job interview, or mention it to them, instead of HR, if you're able to make first contact with them directly.  </p>\n\n<p>On one hand, you don't want to give them a reason to discriminate against you, but on the other hand, they may already be discriminating against you based on your outward behavior during the interview, and putting a label on your behavior could be a good way to bypass that concern. </p>\n\n<p>That being said, the ideal solution would be to focus on your interviewing skills and practice interviewing. After all, even people with autism can improve their verbal and non-verbal demeanor with training. But that is no guarantee either. Perhaps the doctor who diagnosed you could recommend a specialist who could help you with that. </p>\n\n<p>Aside from professional therapy, I'd suggest you take a look at practicing public speaking with <a href=\"http://www.toastmasters.org/Find-a-Club\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toastmasters</a> and practicing technical interviews with <a href=\"https://www.pramp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pramp</a> (assuming you're interviewing for a software developer position). The former is a non-profit public speaking club that has chapters pretty much everywhere. And the latter is a web site where job-hunters take turns interviewing each other over video conferencing and using a technical coding problem that the site gives them. </p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I have been working in an organization for 1 year and few months. After graduation it is my first job. After 1 year they gave me really good increment and recognized me as one of their really good employees. But I am facing an issue there and I'm not sure what to do about it.</p>\n\n<p>Issue:</p>\n\n<p>My team leader does not provide me any negative feedback or constructive criticism. If something is his opinion is not right then he does not point out that thing to me but directly informs about that to his senior, who is project manager.</p>\n\n<p>I am worried that because of this the project manager would be thinking that team lead talks to me but I do not listen to him. Once I was called by project manager and CEO to talk about my interest in the work, and I had no idea what caused those meetings. Apparently team lead had told them that I'm not interested...And project manager also asked me how are my terms with the team lead i.e. is he helpful to me...</p>\n\n<p>It was few months after this that I got a good increment. And obviously that was good feedback of team lead that contributed in that increment.</p>\n\n<p>After those meetings with manager and CEO, I really wanted to ask team lead about this that what am I doing wrong. But I did not, and recently something has happened again that instead of first talking to me, he approached project manager.</p>\n\n<p>I really want to ask team lead about this. And since he prefers to involve manager too, so I wanna talk about it to him too. But I am a straight forward person, I do not know any politics. And I do not have much professional experience. So, I'm afraid that if I'll ask them then things can get complicated for me.</p>\n\n<p>I'll also mention that I'm not a very talkative person. And usually some people think that it is difficult to talk to me because I'm very reserved. But it should not stop a team lead from talking to his subordinate...</p>\n\n<p>How can I encourage my Team Lead to give me the negative feedback directly before escalating management? Should I simply ask team lead to provide me negative feedback? Will it be wise to write it in an email and 'CC' to project manager too?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>The best thing to do would be to have a chat with your team lead. And yes, your talk to your team lead <em>should not include anything about the team lead telling your higher management about you not being interested</em>. Your question should be about your personal development where you ask him/her what you can do to improve your skills. </p>\n\n<p>The best way to prevent these kind of issues in future <em>is to make sure that your lead is comfortable talking to you about your faults</em> (or what he/she presumes are your faults). The expectation that your lead will tell you about your performance might not work out always. Hence, get him/her comfortable by initiating the communication from your side in a positive way. Take it as an opportunity to improve your skills by getting feedback from your lead. This is an interpersonal skill that will serve you well in the future.</p>\n\n<p>PS: As an afterthought, just asking someone to provide negative feedback might not work. I have been asked the same by some teammates and I find it difficult to put up with these requests. Also, shooting out an email with the manager in CC is a nice way to blow up your relations with your lead.</p>\n",
            " <p>In some companies, your team lead provides only technical leadership, such as choosing an architecture, deciding what will be in the next release, and so on. They are not your manager and are not supposed to give you a performance review.</p>\n\n<p>In these companies, the people who do give you performance reviews know that the team leads are closely connected to you (and your peers) and they can ask them \"how is user1204089 doing? How is the skill level, how is the interest level?\" Depending on what they hear from the team leader, they may talk to you and ask you how it's going or what they can do for you. This is <strong>very different</strong> from the team leader approaching them and saying \"hey, user1204089 is just not interested in the work.\" It's even possible that after observing you and talking to you they have already concluded that your team leader isn't very good about providing information about you.</p>\n\n<p>It's important that you know who in the company is assessing and reviewing you. If it's the team leader, you can take steps to make sure that the team leader tells you <strong>as well as</strong> (not instead of, this sounds like you want to get away with bad performance) the higher-ups. If it's one of the higher-ups, you can mention to this person that you'd like more frequent feedback about how you're doing, and even ask whether the team leader is a good person to go to for that feedback.</p>\n\n<p>In other companies the team lead manages you, and is responsible for making you better. Some managers, who aren't good at their jobs, try to set up other people as \"fall guys\" by whispering bad things about them. If you have such a lead, my condolences. But the good news is that your higher-ups don't appear to be fooled. They are giving you salary increases and praise. Work as directly and openly with this lead as you can. For example, you could email the team lead, cc-ing a higher-up, saying \"Ms Higher-Up mentioned today that you are worried I am not interested in learning that new database tool. I'm so sorry you got that impression. I would love to learn it. When can we meet to talk about specific steps and timing?\"</p>\n\n<p>The most important thing to do is to keep doing a good job, and to have the confidence that you are doing so. The next most important thing is open communication with everyone around you. When the higher-ups bring you in for a discussion, see it as a good thing. Hear as much as you can and make sure they know where you stand and how you feel as well. Don't get into secretive or sneaky conversations behind anyone's back. </p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> <em>My business partner has blocked me from contacting him personally and no longer contributes to our business. Is it necessary to inform him that I no longer will be performing my responsibilities as outlined in our agreement?</em></p>\n\n<p>My co-founder 'Bob' and I have a Partnership Agreement to run a small online business - a Youtube channel along with a few social media accounts. His responsibilities were research and recording audio; mine were research, video production, and running the social media accounts. Our venture has not earned any money. Bob also was my long distance relationship boyfriend.</p>\n\n<p>Bob's contribution since the beginning of the venture has been up-and-down. There were a few weeks in which he would record as per the schedule we agreed upon, and then stop after a minor setback (ie. our videos did not receive views/comments). I would ask him from time to time to return to schedule, but he asked me to stop doing so. He did, however, buy a ~$30 microphone to record, of his own volition. He never stated that he no longer wanted to be business partners. I take responsibility for being too lax in negotiating.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I kept to the video production schedule, and I have updated (and continue to update) the social media accounts everyday.</p>\n\n<p>A few months ago Bob and I broke up amicably, but did not discuss what to do with the business. I continued updating the social media accounts during that time. After about a month or so to let the steam cool, I called Bob up to say that I was still interested in running the business and if he was interested in continuing our SOLELY business partnership. He indicated that he was interested in recording again.</p>\n\n<p>The next day I found out that Bob had blocked my personal lines of contact to him.</p>\n\n<p>I have not tried contacting him since then, but I have continued to update the social media accounts. I am no longer interested in doing so, and would like to know if it would be necessary to inform Bob, who is still in a Partnership Agreement with me, that I will no longer be performing my responsibilities as outlined in the agreement. He has not blocked the business's e-mail or social media accounts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> OP here. To clarify further, as this looks to be a point of confusion, Bob has not performed his responsibilities to the business since several weeks before we broke up. All in all, thank you everyone for your responses and advice.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

And I'm not hiring - it's not currently even a likely probability on my potential \"other duties as requested\" list for the year.

Finding things to give in depth questions about without probing into things that my employer would expect your past/current employers to have under NDA is frequently a challenge in my interviewing experience, especially if it's a phone interview where the person could consult SE for answers while being interviewed. I mean, one could still come up with questions, but getting the balance right so you don't accidentally disqualify a skilled honest candidate but still disqualifying dishonest candidates is really tough.</p>\n\n<p>But that's me. And I'm not hiring - it's not currently even a likely probability on my potential \"other duties as requested\" list for the year. Most employers I've interacted with would want to just look at the first page and make a decision from that, and as 520 asserted, that page says nothing about your problem solving.</p>\n\n<p>If you get to talk with the hiring manager before submitting your resume, or someone who knows them, you may benefit from asking about their views on stack exchange. But otherwise, I'd just follow Frank Hopkin's advice, and list it as a hobby.</p>\n"

It would be unethical if you'd say you don't plan to leave (in next 1-2 years) in order to get the training, but actually plan to leave. If you're sure you'll leave soon, you should however communicate it. You would leave a bad impression if it would be known you have planned to leave before the training but didn't say anything only to get the training. </p>\n\n<p>However, your company may try to make a 'moral pression' on you, that you shouldn't leave because of training.

Or something like, 'they are more than happy to offer as long as you ask'.</p>\n<p>However, what I observe from reality is that this is totally not true. In reality, even as a capable employee of my boss, my boss would only think about me when he needs me. Other things, he doesn't care at all, and tries to cut every friendly conversation short.</p>\n<p>Soon I grow to realize the seniors just don't bother. I could be wrong, but the impression I got from numerous attempts is like, juniors are just like disposable tools for them to achieve their next great bonus or career aspiration.</p>\n<p>Maybe I'm too pessimistic, but it seems to me to be a problem. Thus, I'm seeking honest answers to how to properly network with seniors within the company (assume a large organization). I want the 0 to 1 process. But things become very difficult, as seniors judge juniors on the ground of 'what can you do for me?'.</p>\n<p>To simplify things and be very honest, the goal of networking would be for career progression. It exists, no matter how you deny it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: some people ask for rigorous definition of juniority. But as the discussion goes, it is never definite. Despite the terms 'junior' and 'senior' are always implicitly consensed, but for the sake of convenience and rigor, a one sentence assumption to facilitate discussion would be: junior is a relative term, relative to N+2 or up. Though junior is more commonly referred to those with &lt;3 years of work experience. But it would be good to see both cases discussed if possible. The focus here is the rank superiority in general.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>Short and simple answer here:</p>\n<p>Try networking at the water-cooler, in breaks or during company events and try to engage in a professional conversation with them (leave politics and similar sensitive and controversial topics out of that, maybe some tech-talk will work depending on the field you are in).</p>\n<p>In case nobody wants to connect with you professionally - you could always sign up for LinkedIn, Xing or the like and start your career-network outside of your current workplace.</p>\n<p>In regards to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot; In reality, even as a capable employee of my boss, my boss would only think about me when he needs me. Other things, he doesn't care at all, and try to cut every friendly conversation short.&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's their choice and quite common - as long as they are friendly you have to accept that. Not everyone wants to engage on a more personal level beyond what's professionally needed - and that's completely within their rights to set that boundary.</p>\n",
            " <p>What I observe in the modern workplace is that most managers do not &quot;network&quot; at all. What time they do not spend working, they spend at home with their family. Fraternizing even with close friends, much less colleagues is minimal. I host very fancy, luxurious parties frequently and have to practically drag people out of their houses to come. Sure, if the person is 25 years old and single they will come. But a 40-year old executive with 3 kids, it is like a 1% chance I can get him to come, unless there is some huge incentive or compulsion. People just aren't interested in socializing anymore. It just gets more and more isolated and insular every year.</p>\n<p>So, the bottom line here is that you are more or less wasting your energy if you want to befriend an older, married executive.</p>\n<p>The only real exception is that when there is some organized activity that the executives make time for, like fishing or hunting or something like that. Planned outings. To the extent that such outings exist, that is what you should concentrate on. You may even be able to nudge people in the company into organizing an outing.</p>\n",
            " <p>Unfortunately, you can't force people to network with you if they're more invested in their own social/professional group.</p>\n<p>There's a couple of tactics you can use to increase your visibility.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Simply be friendly - a friendly smile and a &quot;hello&quot; if you meet managers and a bit of small talk lets them get to know you a little without seeming like you're forcing yourself upon them.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Find out what they enjoy doing and parrot that behaviour.  This behaviour is more common in the USA where if you want to get in with a boss who likes golf (for example), you take up golf.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I generally stay friendly with people and every so often I find myself invited to social events.  It does help that my managers are pretty friendly open people too though.</p>\n",
            " <p>Remember that a senior manager's time is valuable, there are many demands on that time, and that unless you work in a small company, they literally do not have time to spend on just getting to know everyone.</p>\n<p>If you want to get on their radar, you need to do so on merit. Assume they will be annoyed if you waste their time, and don't bother them unless they invite input <em>and</em> you have something that is genuinely worth their time and that they are the most appropriate person to contact for.</p>\n<p>Wait for them to create opportunities -- all-hands meetings where they stay afterwards to take informal questions -- or catch them at social events they sponsor or attend where work isn't the primary focus</p>\n<p>Or, if there is an internal discussion system like Slack which they participate in, you may be able to distinguish yourself by being a valued participant there and you may be noticed. Note that I said &quot;valued&quot;, not just visible.</p>\n<p>Or, network with folks nearer your own level, which is generally much easier <em>and</em> more productive.</p>\n",
            " <p>iLuvLogix has a good answer, but missed an opportunity with their approach.</p>\n<p>If you find a common interest outside of work, you will have a better chance of having a real conversation with whomever you are trying to talk to. Generally, this works best if it's a personal interest of theirs, instead of it being work related, but you can (and probably should) start off the conversation on a work related conversation.</p>\n<p>The trick is to not make it seem like a planned speech or some formal elevator pitch. Keep it conversational and if they aren't interested, try again later. Maybe.</p>\n<p>Don't be pushy, just be friendly. Maybe they just don't have time right that second to talk about it, and maybe they'll come back to <em>you</em> about the topic. And maybe they won't.</p>\n<p>And don't be a pest. Talk to them when it seems natural to do so, rather than chasing them down at every opportunity.</p>\n<p>People have a wide variety of responses to social interaction and not all of them are great. If you've seen the original GhostBusters movie, you might remember that Janine tries to spark up a conversation with Egon soon after was she hired, but fails miserably because he doesn't really know how to respond appropriately. There may simply not be a good way to interact with some people without a significant amount of effort, and some of that effort may not be welcome, so definitely pick and choose the appropriate people to try to talk to. This feeds into the last paragraph of iLuvLogix 's answer, which I totally agree with.</p>\n",
            " <p>If you want to socialize, then find social events at work to attend. Does your company have</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Employee events? Things like summer picnic, Christmas party.</li>\n<li>Charity work. There might be a fund raising for a &quot;5k walk for ____&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These kinds of events don't run themselves, and volunteering is a good way to interact with people.</p>\n<p>If you work for a souless kind of corporation, maybe you can lead some small events. A potluck lunch. A fantasy sports league (months worth of small talk right here). A halloween office decoration contest.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>If you want to network, I would search for &quot;problems&quot; to work on(*). This depends on your skillset, and the industry you work in.</p>\n<p>Do you interface with other departments? Are you aware of any direct &quot;friction&quot; that causes inefficency? Perhaps your supervisor isn't so keen on small talk, but maybe topics of a more &quot;corporate&quot; interest are easier to converse on. Ideally, this is more productive than just complaining about something.</p>\n<p>Some companies have small amounts of funds allocated to &quot;business development&quot; or small R&amp;D type projects. Such projects often would benefit from additional help. This is a good way to meet peers with unrelated skills, but also networking with superiors.</p>\n<p>Do you have relevant skills that your peers do not, or more experience in some area? Leading a &quot;lunch and learn&quot; event could be beneficial where you talk about a specific technology.</p>\n<p>Do you have IT/programming skills? I guarantee there are higherups that spend too much time on a simple task that coule be automated by a simple script (beware (*)). Something that helped my current career was working on a problem several senior managers were dealing with.</p>\n<p>Do you have annual performance reviews? Maybe you and your supervisor can define a small (*) extra goal that touches on the above concepts. This also provides justification for further discussion (status repotrs, clarification on goals/requirements, etc).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(*) Budget your time accordingly, probably outside of your normal working hours. Some of these tasks you will be compensated for, some you will not. This may or may not ever pay off. In your situation, perhaps corporate recognition has intrinsic value. Set a personal limit on your &quot;risk tolerance&quot; and how long you are willing to wait for any payoff.</p>\n",
            " <p>The same way you make conversation with anyone else: you find out what their hobbies and interests are and look for overlap with your own. I ran into a senior manager for my company at the airport gate when we were both flying home after a company event. Didn't even <em>know</em> he was a senior manager at my company, but noticed that he had some boat-related paraphernalia, and I like sailing, so I struck up a conversation. Of course during the course of the conversation realized who he was, we talked shop a bit.</p>\n<p>Did I get any tangible benefit? Not immediately. But that wasn't the goal: I was just making the best of the situation I found myself in. Now, at least to that particular individual, my face is not a blank one in a mass of peons, but instead &quot;that guy I met at the airport and talked about sailing and yachts with&quot;. You are almost certainly <strong>not</strong> going to have some &quot;big break&quot; moment where a senior manager &quot;discovers&quot; you and you finally get all the recognition you crave and you feel your talent deserves. You get there by being a competent affable self-promoter who gets **** done and doesn't let anyone forget it.</p>\n<p>It helps to genuinely like people. Or to be a scheming Machiavellian sociopath. The first one is easier for me, YMMV.</p>\n",
            " <p>Personally, I feel like 'networking' as a career move should be retired.</p>\n<p>Unless you're in sales and relationships are your business, networking can be overrated.</p>\n<p>As more companies focus on technology and automation, TedTalk style presentations seem to garner more internal respect than generic water cooler conversations. Leaders and managers have to be webinar mastercrafters.</p>\n<p>If your company does regular meetings with employee-led agendas, consider proposing a talk on a new technology or process that you or your team have found successful. Or if you're more on the business side of things, create a case-study on one of your clients.</p>\n<p>Managers love this kind of stuff and will gladly work with employees to demonstrate team wins.</p>\n",

I signed the job offer but told the employer verbally that the expected start date I will write on the offer is just estimated initially based on what I have read on the company\u2019s policy (I can join them one month later) and once I hand in my resignation I will know more. (i.e. if my boss needs me for handover or something).</p>\n\n<p>This Thursday I told my direct manager that I will not renew my contract and he told me that he needs me for two months (so that is one month more than I have calculated initially) so I can help in finding a replacement, train them, handover all my current projects to them. And he told me that the period might be one month only depending on how fast we find a replacement and when can they join.</p>\n\n<p>Right now I am kind of embarrassed to talk to my future employer and tell them that I might join them later. I feel like it was my mistake was that I signed the job offer and gave them an expected start date before talking to my manager.\nWhat is the right approach to handle this?\nShould I negotiate with my current manager on the notice period?\nShould I just be honest to my future employer about the hand over? But what if it takes less than two months and I am able to join early?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>In my opinion the best thing would be tell your new employer directly the situation you are in. Be honest and straight forward. That will give a good impression about you to your new employer and also will solve the problem for you. </p>\n",

What your manager desires<sup>[1]</sup> has nothing to do with what your contract says.</p>\n\n<p>So the next step is to review your contract in the smallest detail and determine if there is any section that requires you to stay longer.  You made need to involve a legal specialist from your locale to help you do this.</p>\n\n<p>Once you are certain of your facts you have two possibilities:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>If there is no requirement for you to stay, then you politely tell\nyour current manager that you will be leaving after one month.</p></li>\n<li><p>If there is a requirement for you to stay past one month, then you\nhave to politely inform your new company that due to a contract\nmis-understanding you are not able to join at the date you\nindicated.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All in all just be honest and polite with both parties, know your contract in the smallest detail and stick to you what you want to do.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[1] Your manager can't seem to decide if it is 1 month or 2 that you have to stay.  But what if it is 3 months?  In my opinion your manager is trying to guilt trip you into staying longer than you want, because the earlier you leave then the more likely he will be blamed for not having a replacement for you.

I don't know if a new employer would see me in a negative light for not mentioning this to them before starting employment with them (I don't know if some employers see this as not focusing on the current job or their business) and I would have only been working there for a few months when it is time for me to send my application. </p>\n\n<p>My employment with my old boss ended on good terms. On my current work history I have been at my old place much longer than my current employer. </p>\n\n<p>So my questions are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>When applying for part time study and need a professional reference, is it better to ask my current employer or my previous employer?

Management often thinks that something is wrong with the employees when something doesn't go right, while the employees find themselves under impossible deadlines and their jobs on the line for decisions made by higher-ups.

Does the project manager consider (or know) the capabilities of the team? Or are they based on what the project manager <em>thinks</em> the tasks should take, or (even worse) what the <em>client</em> thinks the tasks should take? Is the project manager using scoping techniques to determine timelines and time slack?</li>\n<li><strong>Are members of the build team involved?</strong> The people that are actually building your products will know the best what timelines are realistic. Including a lead or senior member will help make sure that your project manager isn't overpromising.</li>\n<li><strong>Does the schedule reflect reality?</strong> Is meeting time included in the schedule? A team may be able to finish a project in 8 hours if that's all they're working on, but if you're holding them up for 2 hours in a meeting, it's going to put them behind if that's not accounted for in the schedule. Additionally, some industries are prone to <em>scope creep</em>, which can turn a good project sour in a hurry. Make sure you're accounting for it by updating the schedule accordingly and enforcing the scope creep clause in your contract with your client (you do have one, right?).</li>\n<li><strong>Is the project methodology you're using actually working for your projects?</strong> If you're a software company, using the Waterfall Method to develop, and your clients are notorious for wanting new features three quarters of the way through the project, then the Waterfall Method is not for you. Learn about and switch to an agile method to better adapt to your clients' and company's needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Do you have reviews after project completion?</strong> I'm not just talking about reviews of the build team, but reviews of <em>everything.</em> Interview both employees and managers, and get their opinions on what went wrong and what went right. What worked? What utterly failed? What didn't fail, but could be better?</li>\n<li><strong>Do you have a method of tracking and prioritizing tasks?</strong> If everything is of highest priority, then nothing has priority. You should have a system in place that communicates what needs to be done, the priority that each item has, what depends on that task (and what tasks that one depends on), and when the task is due.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Second - and this may seem counterintuitive - <strong>invest in your employees</strong>. They are the lifeblood of your company, without them, <em>your company will fall</em>, treat them accordingly.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Instead of laying people off, hire more. This will improve overall morale because one, you're not putting people on the chopping block (which by default lowers morale, as their job security is called into question), and two, you're giving the project the needed man-hours without requiring large amounts of overtime from everyone, preventing burnout. </li>\n<li>At the end of these projects under the \"old way of doing things,\" reward your employees with mandatory paid time off (ie - make them take a vacation so they can recharge). </li>\n<li>If you find that there are genuine issues with how the employees work (keep in mind that knowledge workers often work best with short breaks every hour or so; so make sure you're not mistaking the usual productivity cycles with real issues), get them training on time management.</li>\n<li>Cater their lunches, even if it's just a couple of times a week. This gives them one less thing to worry about, and shows that you care about them, boosting morale.</li>\n<li>If applicable, create a new company culture that allows for employees to pursue their own (work-related) interests. This allows employees to work on a different type of project than what they typically work on, boosting morale and helping stave off burnout.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Yes, these things will cost money, but you're losing far more money on turnover costs and failed projects. Additionally, these things have long-term ROI, because by investing in your employees, they will become more productive as they start to relax and actually find some enjoyment in their work.</p>\n"

A team may be able to finish a project in 8 hours if that's all they're working on, but if you're holding them up for 2 hours in a meeting, it's going to put them behind if that's not accounted for in the schedule. Additionally, some industries are prone to <em>scope creep</em>, which can turn a good project sour in a hurry. Make sure you're accounting for it by updating the schedule accordingly and enforcing the scope creep clause in your contract with your client (you do have one, right?).</li>\n<li><strong>Is the project methodology you're using actually working for your projects?</strong> If you're a software company, using the Waterfall Method to develop, and your clients are notorious for wanting new features three quarters of the way through the project, then the Waterfall Method is not for you. Learn about and switch to an agile method to better adapt to your clients' and company's needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Do you have reviews after project completion?</strong> I'm not just talking about reviews of the build team, but reviews of <em>everything.</em> Interview both employees and managers, and get their opinions on what went wrong and what went right. What worked? What utterly failed? What didn't fail, but could be better?</li>\n<li><strong>Do you have a method of tracking and prioritizing tasks?</strong> If everything is of highest priority, then nothing has priority. You should have a system in place that communicates what needs to be done, the priority that each item has, what depends on that task (and what tasks that one depends on), and when the task is due.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Second - and this may seem counterintuitive - <strong>invest in your employees</strong>. They are the lifeblood of your company, without them, <em>your company will fall</em>, treat them accordingly.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Instead of laying people off, hire more. This will improve overall morale because one, you're not putting people on the chopping block (which by default lowers morale, as their job security is called into question), and two, you're giving the project the needed man-hours without requiring large amounts of overtime from everyone, preventing burnout. </li>\n<li>At the end of these projects under the \"old way of doing things,\" reward your employees with mandatory paid time off (ie - make them take a vacation so they can recharge). </li>\n<li>If you find that there are genuine issues with how the employees work (keep in mind that knowledge workers often work best with short breaks every hour or so; so make sure you're not mistaking the usual productivity cycles with real issues), get them training on time management.</li>\n<li>Cater their lunches, even if it's just a couple of times a week. This gives them one less thing to worry about, and shows that you care about them, boosting morale.</li>\n<li>If applicable, create a new company culture that allows for employees to pursue their own (work-related) interests. This allows employees to work on a different type of project than what they typically work on, boosting morale and helping stave off burnout.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Yes, these things will cost money, but you're losing far more money on turnover costs and failed projects. Additionally, these things have long-term ROI, because by investing in your employees, they will become more productive as they start to relax and actually find some enjoyment in their work.</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I understand the value of networking to the people.  And with sales and marketing positions these shows add value. However unless you are in marketing I fail to see any value gained by the business in having other workers attend the trade shows.  </p>\n\n<p>With the internet most technologies are demonstrated better and earlier online before they ever get to the shows.  I am looking to justify sending workers to trade shows using our training budget, but it seems this value is not really gained by the business and that the money would be better spent sending a few people to focus training every year rather than sending several people to the different trade shows.  I understand the value of providing support if you have a booth or someone in your organization is presenting.  But I am specifically talking about shows where the company has no real stake like this in the show.

            " <p>One previous employer would routinely send QA and developers to tradeshows where the company had a booth. One of the difficulties with \"shrinkwrap\" business software is that the folks writing the software don't always know their customers (in this case, accountants and actuaries). So for this company, it was helpful to get the techies out to learn how the users actually used the product. </p>\n",
            " <p>I think it is a question of the complexity of your product. If you have a technically very complex product, non-marketing personell should be usefull as a backup in discussions where the marketing people are out of their depth. </p>\n",
            " <p>Of course there is business value to sending employees to conferences!</p>\n\n<p>This is especially true if someone in your org presents a talk, but even if they go to schmooze with counterparts from other companies and bond with coworkers, it is still worth it and not just for marketing types. <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html\">Java one</a> isn't only marketing, nor is <a href=\"http://velocityconf.com/velocity2012\">Velocity</a>, nor is <a href=\"http://www.eclipsecon.org/2012/\">EclipseCon</a>. These are opportunities for folks to see the state-of-the-art, interact with the top practitioners in their field and become excited about what they're doing by sharing ideas with others.</p>\n\n<p>I can understand why a beancounter (not saying Chad is one) might disagree. It is fashionable in the current economic environment to attempt to calculate an explicit ROI for every expenditure. <strong>The problem is that you just can't compute the business value of an intellectually engaged happy employee who mingles somewhat regularly with a wide range of professionals.</strong> Some people will simply add up the hotel, plane, per-diem, and missing days of work and see a cost-sink. That's not right. </p>\n",
            " <p>One advantage of sending a representative from your technical team to \"buying\" conferences (where you're looking at products others are trying to sell rather than hawking your own wares) that hasn't been mentioned is that they have the opportunity to intercept snap decisions that are occasionally made by executives who attend these shows and fall for the glitz and glamor that typically surround the presentations.  </p>\n\n<p>Having someone close at hand to whisper in their ears can prevent costly mistakes and lost time investigating solutions that would never have been considered if the right questions had been asked at the conference.</p>\n\n<p>I imagine other sections of the business would have similar advantages in their own areas of expertise.</p>\n",
            " <p>I am sure there are more but these are two that I can think of without too much effort:</p>\n\n<p>If you are in industries where the technology changes a lot (e.g. software), you get more value from a good trade show talking to the technicians than attending training classes. </p>\n\n<p>This is mainly because training courses by nature only focus on non cutting edge stuff and you get more done by talking to the developers instead. Shows give you the chance to get in depth information from the horses mouth, which can be invaluable.</p>\n\n<p>Or,</p>\n\n<p>If you are in product development of any sort, you generally get more from trade shows as well. In this day and age, technology know-how is often secondary to having great ideas that can act as differentiators for your company's products.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say you already know how to design cars relatively well. Your time is better served by seeing what the other people are doing at trade shows instead of learning another design skill in a classroom where exposure is limited. </p>\n\n<p>You may not learn how to design faster, or quicker, or in the latest fashionable way at trade shows but what you get is the chance to pick up on new ideas and a head start on  designing the RIGHT product in the first place. </p>\n\n<p>That in itself is infinitely more valuable.</p>\n",
            " <blockquote>\n  <p>However unless you are in marketing I fail to see any value gained by the business in having other workers attend the trade shows.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, <strong>small companies and startups</strong>, fighting for their existence, may need to send non-marketing people to trade shows. Here's why:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A small company should send a <a href=\"http://m.urbandictionary.com/#define?term=smokeshow\">smokeshow</a> to a trade show to stand at the company's booth and attract foot traffic. [In a small company, this person may or may not work in marketing.]</li>\n<li>A small company needs somebody with \"tech credibility\" to attend trade shows to converse with prospective customers, listen to their business problems, and establish the company's product as a solution to their problems. Sometimes a founder, a marketing person, or a salesperson has enough tech credibility to fill these needs, but not always. [This is also why larger companies sometimes hire pre-sales engineers.]</li>\n<li>While I agree that product managers and lead programmers are generally more useful at the workplace, building the product, they too can capture some value at trade shows. When a product manager or lead programmer understands what the marketplace demands, at a deep level, they can exercise superb judgement on requirements decisions. They can gain insight that will help them steer the product in a direction that more closely aligns with what the marketplace demands. </li>\n</ol>\n",
            " <p>I do this on a regular basis.  A trade show is a good place to gain key business insight, however I want my sales and marketing team focussed on - well selling and marketing.</p>\n\n<p>So - when I usually send technical staff along with key, specific briefs that match with their skills and insight. These might be to review the technology of specific key competitors, or what aligned businesses are doing, or look for things that might be a threat to our business model.    </p>\n\n<p>They might not attend the whole show, just a single day, as this helps to maintain focus.</p>\n\n<p>If you combine this with meeting clients and providing technical support if needed to the selling process, its worth doing.  </p>\n\n<p>It can also help them gain appreciation of what the sales and marketing team actually have to do, which can help to break down internal communication barriers in the company.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong> To fully answer, some of this is funded from my training budget, especially for less senior staff where I need to grow their wider understanding of the industry.  This is usually - but not always - where we have identified a specific career development need.   We also send staff to attend technical conferences on a training budget, and I trust them to report back whether it was high value or not.</p>\n",
            " <p>The obvious value of sending employees to trade shows is extracting them from the dreary sweatshop routine of daily work, &amp; letting them relax a bit at company's expense, see new people, places, get new impressions and ideas. It is a perk that should always be distributed around as fairly as the managers can afford.</p>\n\n<p>(To naysayers: this does help in building morale for the company in general).</p>\n",
            " <p>I've found great value in sending employees whose work with customers is primarily over the phone or via email. Our credit department, in particular, has had great success. Instead of being thought of as a faceless collection agency, our credit reps can show them selves to be problem solvers. </p>\n\n<p>Another benefit is that employees who feel chained to their desks really appreciate the chance to spend a day (on the clock) away from the office doing something new and interacting with customers and coworkers in a different light.</p>\n\n<p>I pick and choose quite carefully. Not every show is appropriate for exrta staff.</p>\n"

We are talking about software engineering and technical processes.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>From your comment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The tasks that we do are all critical so can't take much chances on someone lack of understanding, hence the quiz idea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the tasks are critical then what you want is for all your team to be qualified and up-to-speed, as you well said.</p>\n<p>With that goal in mind, doing a test to find out the level of understanding will not actually help you to fill the gaps some team members may have on the topic. What will actually help you is to <strong>instruct or teach</strong> the basic required knowledge that you want on every member.</p>\n<p>Some sort of cheat sheet or compilation of the technologies involved I'm thinking.

            " <p>So, strictly speaking there is nothing wrong with what you're doing.  You <em>can</em> create and apply this quiz, and you <em>can</em> recommend that people who do not perform well get fired.  But you run a couple risks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You risk having your company or team labelled as too cutthroat.  Nobody wants to work on a team or on a project where the possibility of being fired is always over their head if they don't perform at 100% on all things at all times.  The way industry works, the entire point of the Industrial Revolution, is that teams can cover for each others' mistakes; if one person doesn't know something or isn't good at something, someone else on the team will train them and pick them up so that the team as a whole will improve.  That's how teamwork works.  What you are doing is the opposite: You are saying there is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, everyone has to be the best individually or get out.  That's how you get people not cooperating with each other; if I have to ask you a question because I don't know something, but asking the question might show that I don't know something and that might get me fired, then I'm more likely to try to flub through it and do a subpar job, just so I don't have to raise attention to my own lack of knowledge.  So I'll deliver something that is worse than what I would have delivered if I felt comfortable simply asking someone for help.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To rectify this, the solution should not be &quot;take a test, those with bad scores are fired&quot;.  The solution should be &quot;on this team, if you don't know something, we have a culture where you can and should speak up and ask for help, and someone else will help you; however, if it becomes very obvious that you are simply incompetent, then we'll take appropriate action; in the meantime though, feel free to collaborate&quot;.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>If you don't actually have the power to fire people, you may get a reputation as someone who does not work well with others.  If your response to working with people who are less experienced is to immediately run to senior management and try to get them fired, you may find yourself on the way out the door instead as someone who can't work with others.  At the very least, you will be recognized as such by your peers and nobody will want to work with you on your projects, and you will have a much harder time finding competent and helpful people to work with.  You will eventually have your team filled with people who are begrudgingly assigned to help you, and those types of people are not the best producers.  Furthermore, if you have a history with this person you are looking to target with this quiz, and your history is known, it might come off as a grudge attack on them and you'll come off as toxic.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The way to fix this is, again, to not take the idea of &quot;if you don't know everything, then you're fired&quot;.  You want to be a pleasant person to work with.  If you get a reputation as being toxic, no company wants toxic employees and you may learn that lesson sooner than later.</p>\n<p>If you choose to pursue this idea of a quiz and recommending those who fail to be fired, be very very careful with what you do with the results.  To be honest, if I was senior management in your company and you came to me with this out of the blue, my concerns would be 1) Why were you making up this quiz on company time rather than doing something productive, and 2) Why were you not spending that time being constructive rather than being toxic, now get out of my office and by the way don't come to work tomorrow either.

            " <blockquote>\n<p>Can I conduct quiz among my team to evaluate their understanding? Is\nthis ethically correct thing to do so?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is it ethical? Most likely yes, but why reinvent the wheel?</p>\n<p>Just follow the PIP (Personal Improvement Plan) protocol outlined by your HR department. You already have one suspect in mind, so that means you've already caught one person not knowing what they're doing.</p>\n<p>That's great. Now draft a PIP for that person. List the basic topic(s) that this person seemed to be deficient in. Then, list all the topics you expect that person to already be proficient in. Assign a deadline for that person to catch up and be tested on. Then, ask HR, plus anyone else who might be involved in the firing decision, to double-check the PIP before you give it out to the employee in question.</p>\n<p>If the employee has a problem with the PIP, he'll tell you what it is. But if he doesn't have a problem with it, he'll sign it.</p>\n<p>Once the deadline arrives, then quiz that person privately yourself (or with HR or with a manager present). Testing someone privately will help them save face in front of their colleagues. Also, testing one person is a lot easier than testing multiple people. If you test multiple people, chances are high that they'll help each other cheat on the quiz.</p>\n<p>Not to mention, if you have multiple people on your team, chances are that those multiple people don't have the same titles and don't have the same salaries, and it wouldn't make sense to use the same standard or the same questions to test all of them either.</p>\n<p>Also, if you test team members that don't need to be tested, you risk antagonizing the entire team. After all, it shouldn't be that hard to find the clueless members of a team if you scrutinize their pull requests or their work products long enough, or if you just talk to each of them.</p>\n",
            " <p>Rather than test them, run micro-training sessions with them, on the topics where you see problems.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>remind them that everyone has to file a bug report when the find a bug - that is mandatory;</li>\n<li>remind them that peer reviewes are mandatory;</li>\n<li>explain again what process is expected to apply when doing XYZ task.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During these micro-trainings, provide the information from the company's processes, and remind the team where they can find the said processes, to refresh their knowledge when needed.</p>\n<p>If you notice that some person(s) continues to underperform in spite of the micro-trainings, do the following IN ORDER:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Have a discussion with the person (or each person); do not have a group chat; try to understand where is the problem, try to find a solution together with them;</li>\n<li>If the first step still fails, talk to their managers and agree to a course of action.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p>When you notice a problem and you take a corrective action, it is your job to handle that specific problem.</p>\n<p>When you apply tests, you will create tension in the team, when they rank according to the test results.</p>\n"

What will actually help you is to <strong>instruct or teach</strong> the basic required knowledge that you want on every member.</p>\n<p>Some sort of cheat sheet or compilation of the technologies involved I'm thinking. One that can be distributed to every member for them to read, learn and research and complement on their own, before embarking on the project/sprint/etc..</p>\n<p>Then, if a member does not yet comprehend something, they can consult the team leader (you?) or other teammates to clarify (if they <em>still</em> don't get it well... then that would be a red flag for that employee).</p>\n<p>Of course... if your (or your company's) actions would not mind replacing members with the lowest scores, then just doing a quiz could suffice (you'll have to do one to the replacement as well in order to decide I guess).</p>\n<p>But, most likely your company is not in this position, and what actually wants is for their employees to learn and become more qualified as new projects come with time.</p>\n",
        "rejected_target": " <p>So, strictly speaking there is nothing wrong with what you're doing.  You <em>can</em> create and apply this quiz, and you <em>can</em> recommend that people who do not perform well get fired.  But you run a couple risks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You risk having your company or team labelled as too cutthroat.  Nobody wants to work on a team or on a project where the possibility of being fired is always over their head if they don't perform at 100% on all things at all times.  The way industry works, the entire point of the Industrial Revolution, is that teams can cover for each others' mistakes; if one person doesn't know something or isn't good at something, someone else on the team will train them and pick them up so that the team as a whole will improve.  That's how teamwork works.  What you are doing is the opposite: You are saying there is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, everyone has to be the best individually or get out.  That's how you get people not cooperating with each other; if I have to ask you a question because I don't know something, but asking the question might show that I don't know something and that might get me fired, then I'm more likely to try to flub through it and do a subpar job, just so I don't have to raise attention to my own lack of knowledge.  So I'll deliver something that is worse than what I would have delivered if I felt comfortable simply asking someone for help.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To rectify this, the solution should not be &quot;take a test, those with bad scores are fired&quot;.  The solution should be &quot;on this team, if you don't know something, we have a culture where you can and should speak up and ask for help, and someone else will help you; however, if it becomes very obvious that you are simply incompetent, then we'll take appropriate action; in the meantime though, feel free to collaborate&quot;.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>If you don't actually have the power to fire people, you may get a reputation as someone who does not work well with others.  If your response to working with people who are less experienced is to immediately run to senior management and try to get them fired, you may find yourself on the way out the door instead as someone who can't work with others.  At the very least, you will be recognized as such by your peers and nobody will want to work with you on your projects, and you will have a much harder time finding competent and helpful people to work with.  You will eventually have your team filled with people who are begrudgingly assigned to help you, and those types of people are not the best producers.  Furthermore, if you have a history with this person you are looking to target with this quiz, and your history is known, it might come off as a grudge attack on them and you'll come off as toxic.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The way to fix this is, again, to not take the idea of &quot;if you don't know everything, then you're fired&quot;.  You want to be a pleasant person to work with.  If you get a reputation as being toxic, no company wants toxic employees and you may learn that lesson sooner than later.</p>\n<p>If you choose to pursue this idea of a quiz and recommending those who fail to be fired, be very very careful with what you do with the results.  To be honest, if I was senior management in your company and you came to me with this out of the blue, my concerns would be 1) Why were you making up this quiz on company time rather than doing something productive, and 2) Why were you not spending that time being constructive rather than being toxic, now get out of my office and by the way don't come to work tomorrow either.

    "\n\nHuman: <h2>First, a little bit of background:</h2>\n\n<p>I've been in this company for a little over 2 years. We were a small team of 3 people managing and developing the tools for our companies (we are the HQ). Almost 5 months ago, one of our colleagues left and since then I am having an increased number of tasks. Over these 2 years I have learned a lot and now I'm faster and more efficient at completing tasks and am able to tackle more complex matters too.</p>\n\n<h2>Salary history</h2>\n\n<p>This job was advertised as \"the minimum salary for this job is xx$\". And since before this job I've done a one year internship and it was the first \"real\" job plus the fact that it was matching perfectly with what I've done for one year and it also was what I wanted to continue with, I didn't try to negotiate this minimum offered salary out of fear of not getting the job. Fast forward 1 year later, I was waiting for the first employee appraisal in the hopes that I will be able to get a salary increase. Unfortunately, the management decided they want to change the direction in which the company is going and my boss was let go. Shortly after, we got a new boss and nobody had his appraisal that year from the department. Waited almost another year for the next appraisal, for which I have asked multiple times, over a time span of 2 months, and finally had the meeting and at the end of the meeting finally asked for a raise.</p>\n\n<p>Off-topic: The raise mentioned above is quite big in %, almost 30% but considering that even with that raise for my current experience I will be on par with the job market or even lower. I am not justifying my asked increase based on the fact that I've been doing this for over 2 years, but based on the market and what they would need to spend to replace me. I'd like to point out that I received a positive feedback in the appraisal and was told to keep up the good work.</p>\n\n<h2>Back to the salary negotiation</h2>\n\n<p>I didn't get a no from my boss for my asked raise, just that he needs to talk to HR. I was pretty happy back then because I thought that even if in the event in which I wasn't to going to get exactly what I asked for, I would be happy with even a slightly lower increase (20-25%). Now 3 months and a half passed and I have asked 4 times about the status of my request and stating that this is important to me not only due to the financial part but this would reflect how the company values me. Every time, I get more or less the same answer: still waiting for an answer from HR (my boss has a very important position in the company and probably he is not being honest as this salary increase should be very well in his power).</p>\n\n<h2>Notes:</h2>\n\n<p>This question is not about the %. As mentioned before, I didn't get a \"no\" for one second or a remark that it's too much.</p>\n\n<p>I love working here and I have spend a lot of time to learn the specifics of this company, I would like to do everything in my power to avoid leaving.</p>\n\n<p>The company is looking for months for someone to replace the colleague who left and they haven't been able to do it so far (mostly because with the set of skills asked, those people are already working as consultants and earning more). Note: the colleague which left the company, left for the same reason: asked for a raise and he got a \"no\". But at least he got an answer pretty fast...</p>\n\n<h2>Question</h2>\n\n<p>How should I continue from here? Should I try to be more pushy and ask again if he's (boss) happy with my performance and if the answer is \"yes\" then go ahead and ask firmly to have my situation finalized. Is it normal that it takes this long for an answer, or this would show a complete lack of interest for the employee? My goal is to at least get a \"no\" or a \"yes\", tired of waiting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Probably not a duplicate of \"How to approach my boss if I'm feeling underpaid\". I have already read that even before I had my first negotiation and followed the advices there to discus about my achievements and why I should I be getting a raise. Now it's a matter of done that and <strong>now what</strong>?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit nr. 2</strong>: Since I can't add a comment to Joe's answer due to the low reputation, I'll type additional info here. First of all, thank you Joe, long time reader of your answers here. My boss talked to HR for sure at least once, because there was also the discussion if they should change my contract type to have more hours included, to that HR sent back quite fast a \"no\" because I am not above a certain trigger that they are having. I know that they can't afford losing another team member because due to the specifics of the job, it takes 6 months to 1 year to get familiarized with all the custom tools and how they are built (can be faster for a fast learner). Now, I don't know why would HR drag this, the only reason I could think of, is they are first looking for a replacement for my colleague and once they have that they will say \"no\" to me.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

Eventually they buckled and replied with &quot;we don't give increases&quot;.</p>\n<p>My manager continued the struggle and last month they conceded and gave me a 20% increase. It sounds like a lot, but they had been underpaying so badly that I am still earning less than half of what I feel I deserve.</p>\n<p>Luckily after being ignored for 3 months I could foresee how it was going to transpire. So I started searching for a new job in the meantime. Tomorrow is my last day here and I am ecstatic to finally break free, but I wasted years of my life and lost hundreds of thousands of monies from being underpaid. I am so angry with myself for waiting so long to stand up for myself.</p>\n<p>Don't make the same mistake I did.</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Here's my situation: I've worked at the same place for over three years. I was working overnights part-time until I was promoted to a full-time position two months ago, doing something different than what I had been doing as a part-timer. I signed a non-compete contract but now I am having regrets as this job hasn't been a good fit at all. I dread going in everyday and I get my work torn apart all the time. I can take constructive criticism but what's happening is beyond that. I bite my tongue because I'm \"new\" but it's just an unhealthy situation.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I had been looking to get into a new line of work for over a year while I was a part-timer but when the full-time opportunity came up, I took it mainly because it was better hours and more money.</p>\n\n<p>Now I'm back to the job search again and I have two interviews set up this week. I'm hopeful that one of these comes through because it would be better for my personal and professional life, but I'm somewhat worried about breaking my contract.</p>\n\n<p>The non-compete clause is specific to the industry and neither of the two jobs I'm interviewing for would qualify. I've also heard of only one instance at my current employer where management thought about suing someone under contract because they were being difficult about wanting to get out of it.</p>\n\n<p>But like I said, it is worrisome when that's being held over you. I also don't want to go to my boss and say something to the degree of \"I'm not liking my job\" or \"This isn't a good fit\" for fear of a downward spiral within the company or getting fired right then and there.</p>\n\n<p>How should I go about this in the event I'm offered a new position?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

I do not want use Skype because no internet cafes here have it. This software is spyware; I do not want to create an account.

Japan</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I cancelled the interview because I can't find an internet cafe with Skype.</p>\n\n<p>Does this mean they're not a good company, inflexible and with bad management?</p>\n\n<p>I forgot: the company's job adertisement did not say that the company only uses Skype for interviews.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <blockquote>\n  <p>Is my guess correct?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>No.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The requirement to use Skype doesn't imply a bad company, inflexibility, or bad management. It's likely just a nod to the ubiquity of Skype these days.</p>\n\n<p>You can obviously decide not to work there, but you'll be limiting your base of potential employers a lot. Skype is pretty standard fare. </p>\n\n<p>You would be better served to borrow a computer with Skype already installed, assuming you don't already own a computer. Or as @QuaestorLucem wisely suggests, use your smartphone if you own one.</p>\n",
            " <p>Our company exclusively uses Google hangouts for interviews. We are absolutely a flexible company. However, that is our video chat software so it's what we use.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to look at this question is the employer perspective:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There is a candidate that insists we use their own video software for the interview, are they likely to be a high maintenance employee who needs special things?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It also looks like you can use <a href=\"https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34665/try-skype-without-a-skype-account-on-skype-com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Skype for web</a>, too, so you could do that without installing anything, which seems like it would work for your purposes. Create a throwaway account for the interview, use the online interface, and that's all you'd have to do.</p>\n",
            " <p>I am actually working in Japan, and I can tell you that <strong>I am not surprised by their answer.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>It does not tell that it's a bad company, but only a real Japanese company</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>At work (and not only) they are totally inflexible with policies and rules, even if that sounds stupid for you. The good point is that nobody will never address you any reproaches for doing stupid things if the policies or the rules enforced it.\nAnother good point is that if the the rule is smart or/and useful, even people that doesn't understand it will stick to it.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to work with Japanese people or in Japan, you should start changing a bit, and accept that sometimes you'll have to do stupid things because your boss or your client told you so.</p>\n",
            " <p>Consider the company's point of view. What if every job candidate had different preferred software? Now they have to install dozens of different software packages and learn to use them. That would be a giant administrative pain.</p>\n\n<p>And think about what it says about you as a potential employee if you refuse to use the company's preferred software. Suppose you get the job. Are you going to refuse to use the company email system and insist on using your own? Are you going to refuse to write company documents in Word and insist on using Open Office? Are you going to refuse to write your programs in C# and insist on using VB? Are you going to demand that they buy you a special chair and use your preferred brand of coffee maker in the break room? Etc.</p>\n\n<p>There are big advantages to a company if everybody is using the same tools. Sure, there are times when there is good reason to break the pattern and do something different. If a company says \"We always use Microsoft products. You say that in this case where there are overwhelming advantages to using a non-Microsoft project? No, you don't understand, let me explain again. We always use Microsoft products.\", sure, that's foolish and narrow-minded and inflexible. </p>\n\n<p>But it is perfectly reasonable to say, \"We conduct all our tele-meetings with Skype so that our people only need to install one telemeeting product on their computers, and anyone who has that software installed can participate in any meeting. We don't doubt that other products may have advantages, but those advantages are not enough to outweigh the convenience of everyone using the same standard product.\"</p>\n",
            " <p>\"Skype is spyware\": Citation needed.</p>\n\n<p>Fact of the matter is, Skype is simply the most stable videoconferencing product out there.  I once had an interview with a company who asked me to use a lesser-known one (Zoom or something?), and I spent the first 15 minutes trying to set it up after being told that a Linux client existed when it was highly unstable and wouldn't even load on my computer.  Subsequently we tried using Google Hangouts, which connected but the communication was very unstable, so we ended up just using Skype in the end.  I passed the interview anyway, but it would have been much smoother on both sides if we had just used Skype to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>As for why no telephone interview, I'm not exactly sure; what I do know is that many Japanese companies have an obsession with video conferencing.  Perhaps it's because \"we're a tech company we shouldn't use telephones\" or something, I don't know.  But I've never had a phone interview with a Japanese company.  In any case, Skype is much cheaper to use than a long-distance phone call, so that could be a reason too.</p>\n\n<p>Just install Skype and use it.  Uninstall it later if you don't like it, or use a throwaway account, or whatever.</p>\n",
            " <p><strong>TLDR: It's not indicating bad management, but it might mean they are not a good fit for you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It's not a bad company. And Skype is not considered spyware. \nSadly a decent amount of user tracking and convenience over anonymity / user liberty/ security / data protection is the norm these days.</p>\n\n<p>They have their company solution to do interview (and other calls) and they follow that. I'd find it a bit inflexible to not fall back to a normal telephone conversation, but that they are not too keen on installing other software is totally normal. Some companies where individual employees have a lot of individual responsibility and freedom might accept that, but I would not expect that you can dictate to any company how the interview is done.</p>\n\n<p>Now what does it say about the company? It's probably decently large. The larger a company gets the more it tends to follow policies / company wide solutions to standard problems and adhere to them. There are exceptions where individuals / individual departments have large freedoms, but this seems to be a company that has a tight organisation - at least if the HR department is indicative of the rest of the company.</p>\n\n<p>So while it's not ultimately bad, it might just not be an environment where you would want to work. If you prefer flexibility, individual decisions and or a focus on data protection / user empowerment / open source software, then this could indicate that this is not the right company for you. However, sometimes different departments in the same company are run totally different. While the HR department might have strict rules and use mass market software, other departments might be run different. E.g. in many companies the default operating system is Windows (along with central administration), but people in certain departments are allowed to install their own OS on their work machine and manage their machine themselves (but don't get the same support in maintaining it). Whether this is the case, you won't find out if you don't get an interview.</p>\n\n<p>But if you have enough other options, then this can be a quick filter that sorts out companies you likely don't fit with anyway.</p>\n\n<p><em>Options to manage the problem as good as possible</em>: As many companies do use Skype for their remote interview calls, you might want to try and get past that step to see if they are generally a bad fit or whether this is the only thing you don't like while minimising the \"impact\" on you. I'm assuming here that you either don't want to install Skype on your machine, as you consider it spyware, and/or that you don't want to identify yourself towards Microsoft when using Skype. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ask to use normal telephone instead (in this case you tried and did not succeed, but still this, is relatively likely an option,at least compared to suggesting other software based options) </li>\n<li>Use web-skype, that way you avoid an installation of something you consider spyware, you still require an account though</li>\n<li>If you feel really paranoid about it, you might also use a Linux distribution on a USB stick to boot into that instead of your normal OS and either install Skype there or use web skype from that system</li>\n<li>if you want to avoid providing your real phone number when creating a throwaway account, you can try to use an online service that allows you to read sms to mobile numbers provided by them online (google for concrete services); however, those numbers are often black-listed by big companies soon after they go online it seems. So you might have to try a few times till you manage to open an account with one of them. And you run the risk that it is shut-down by Skype should they find out afterwards (no idea what their policy is regarding the usage of such phone numbers). You might want to make sure that is not illegal where you live depending on how harsh your government looks at attempts to stay anonymous.</li>\n<li>buy a cheap/used phone with a prepaid sim card, install Skype there and use it only for your interviews, then get rid of both (or re-install the system on the phone), same option applies to a laptop</li>\n<li>ask in an internet cafe if they can install Skype for you; even if they don't have it on there as a default, they might be fine with installing it. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Personal Opinion</em>: To me it's funny that Skype is now adapted all over the place in corporations when it stopped being the leading solution that works without problems cross-platform quite a while ago. Due to that one might see a fixation on Skype as a (tiny) indicator of a company trying to catch up with the times, but still quite a bit behind. But I personally wouldn't use that as a sole discriminator to go ahead or not with an interview process.</p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I'm currently a 24 yr old contract-to-hire developer at this company. I'm five months in to a six month contract. My job title is \"Developer.\" No prefix. I'm between Junior/Entry-Level and Senior. I'm on a team with two senior developers, one of which is driving me insane.</p>\n\n<p>He constantly talks down to me like I don't know what I'm doing. It's one thing if he's helping me with a process that's unique to how the company's data or services are structured, but he is always telling me the most fundamental tips about programming that are not company specific. He's telling me how to be a developer as if I've never programed before. This is not just simple hazing or \"new guy\" kind of talking. My impression is that he honestly seems to think I can't do my job. I will say on his behalf that he doesn't say it with a demeaning tone or with any kind of annoyance. I think he does mean well.</p>\n\n<p>I know I'm young, but I do have a lot of experience including seven years of work experience and a few first and second place awards on the national level. I feel insulted by his comments.</p>\n\n<p>This is the best paying job I've ever had and I moved across the country to work here. He is a strong reason for why I'm thinking of throwing all that away and not staying with the company when the contract is up.</p>\n\n<p>It's been five months and I've done plenty of good work. I'm running out of ways to show him that I don't want to be treated this way. How can I get the point across to him while keeping it professional? Or, perhaps, how can I keep my sanity and feeling of self worth if he continues?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: He is not my boss or team lead. We work on the same level in the team.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>How likely do you think it is for you to find other people like this in other workplaces? Seriously ponder this question for a moment as the guy may be technically skilled but not great at dealing with people which may be something you'll encounter in fields like IT where specialized skills can be sought and others find ways to work with difficult people that may be more than a bit eccentric at times.</p>\n\n<p>The conversation I suggest you have with him is about your background and that the tips he points out aren't needed. In a way this is more about how you are being treated as perhaps he doesn't know how much this agitates you. While I can see in your post you are more than a little rattled, I wonder how well is he supposed to know this? Avoidance just keeps the same cycle going as he may think this is useful and just keep at it. After all, what are you telling him that should lead him to think otherwise?</p>\n\n<p>Before the conversation be sure to have a few examples of what was pointed so that you can reference examples and possibly see if you could brainstorm solutions to this as I doubt this will be the only time you come across this kind of co-worker.</p>\n",
            " <p>Do you learn from this guy?</p>\n\n<p>I have been in a similar situation, being talked down to etc, but the individual also taught me a lot, albeit in a condescending way.</p>\n\n<p>I rejected this person at the time as I felt that they were targeting me specifically. I only saw the negative and I wish I could go back and let them know that I have changed my view, but some people, especially in IT, aren't the most people friendly, and learning how to work with those people is a skill in itself which can be rewarding too as there is often a lot to learn from them.</p>\n\n<p>My point is that if you find that you do learn and improve as a result of this person, who it sounds like is taking a special interest in you, then it might be an idea to learn to cope with their personality and use this as an opportunity to become a better developer.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, when somebody sees potential in somebody else and they know that the person could do better, they express this in less than ideal ways.</p>\n\n<p>If not, then maybe start looking for another job.</p>\n",
            " <p>\"How can I get the point across to him while keeping it professional?\"</p>\n\n<p>Does he tell you the same things over and over,  indicating that he isn't paying attention to what you are saying?  A gentle reminder might be in order (gravely nod and say \"yes, I remember you telling me that yesterday.\") and fast forward him to what you need to learn(...and what I'd really like to know is...\")</p>\n\n<p>Or is he covering new ground, just things you already know?  If this is the case, just nod and wait until he takes a breath or there is a polite point of entry into the conversation, and ask him about some aspects of the process that you <em>don't</em> know.  Find ways to learn more than you already know.  He's a senior level guy; if you can't find ways to steer him into giving you useful information then it sounds as if you are more concerned with what you already know than what you don't know.  That's an attitude that could be deadly to your career.</p>\n\n<p>Many times on job interviews I have been given questions to answer and I could not answer them; often I find out that what they really wanted to know was how I reacted when I didn't know the answer.  Often, what you know isn't as important as how well you learn, and how you react to instruction.  Especially when you are only 24 years old.  If that last statement stung a bit, it sounds as if you may be partly causing your own problem.</p>\n\n<p>Push yourself to learn more.  Go to your coworker with more advanced questions.  That's the best way to divert him from the basics; prove that you are ready and able to discuss advanced concepts.  And above all, focus on what you want to learn, <em>not</em> what you know.</p>\n\n<p>\"Or, perhaps, how can I keep my sanity and feeling of self worth if he continues?\"</p>\n\n<p>You can keep your sanity by not basing your feelings of self worth on whether or not this guy you work with acknowledges how much you know, and instead focus on doing your job, improving and getting along with people.  I don't think there is anyone, anywhere who is appreciated as much as they feel they deserve.  And people who focus on getting respect rather than deserving it spend their whole lives chasing the wind.</p>\n",
            " <p>The short answer is you have to take control of the conversations.  You have allowed him to have control.</p>\n\n<p>Begin by asking very pointed, direct questions, and even then only when necessary.  If you ask open-ended questions, he is (apparently) the type that will take that opportunity to lecture.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of asking \"How does the consumables tracking module work with the client billing module?\"  ask him, \"Do you have the interface specification between the consumables tracking module and the client billing module?\"  Then if he starts to explain what consumables are or why you need to bill the client, you have every reason to say, \"I hate to interrupt, but I'm already familiar with both the systems, and I'd really like to get working on this interface issue right away.  Can you please give the the interface specification.\"</p>\n\n<p>Obviously that's pretty specific for the purpose of an example, but by tightening the focus of your questions, you demonstrate your familiarity and competence with the technologies, and present yourself as a \"business-only, get-it-done\" type, which is not necessarily rare, but somewhat unexpected from your age group.</p>\n\n<p>If he's well-meaning, as you said you believe, a couple of weeks of this should change his dynamic with you.  If he's trying to prop himself up at your expense, then he'll soon see you as unsuitable for that purpose, and find a new \"apprentice.\"  Either way, he should stop treating you in the manner that you are frustrated by.</p>\n\n<p>If he does not, then you will have at least laid the groundwork for a complaint to your supervisor that your time is being wasted with \"Computer Science 131.\"</p>\n",
            " <p>My advice, to be blunt: suck it up.  If you like the job and the only problem is that a senior member of staff politely offers you guidance that you don't actually need, you should seriously consider that there is no such thing as a perfect job, and if it isn't this annoyance at the next job, it will be something else.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry to say it but you <em>are</em> still quite young and haven't even been there 6 months.  It will take time to prove your skill and knowledge and value to this team.  If you quit now you'll be the new guy on some other team, and you'll have to prove yourself to them.  </p>\n\n<p>So, get a thicker skin and don't let the fact that this guy doesn't think you know what you're doing bother you.  Answer <strong>politely</strong> with phrases like, \"thanks, I did know that\" or \"yes, I learned that a couple of years ago when working on X\" etc. and resolve not to let it bother you.  You can't control his actions, you can only control your own reactions. Don't get offended.  Just observe to yourself \"hmm, Larry still doesn't think I know how to do X -- that's silly since he knows I did Y at my prior company, which I couldn't have accomplished without knowing X.  Oh well, I guess he just wants to be sure.\"  And then stop thinking about it, don't obsess over it, don't try to get him to stop, don't try to barge in and finish his sentences.  Just let it go.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a mutual boss, you might also go to him/her and say something like \"Larry insists on continually giving me programming pointers that I don't need, and at this point I'm starting to find it a little insulting.  Is there any chance you could encourage him to lay off a bit?\"  If there isn't someone obvious to have this conversation with, revert back to \"suck it up\" and manage your reaction. </p>\n",
            " <p>Reverse it, and start teaching him how to do his job at the most fundamental level. Randomly explain to him what a method is.  When any opportunity arises, explain to him why you'd declare a variable as an int instead of a String. Explain to him the order of operations. Have a heart to heart to him as to why it's good to declare constants instead of having numbers throughout your code. Each time he offers you basic, unsolicited advice make sure you give him 2 ridiculous suggestions that same day. Within a week he'll stop.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: There was some element of hyperbole in there, but I've dealt with the type of people the OP has talked about. He has tried to discuss this head on, and that hasn't worked.We tried the same thing. He would talk down to us truly in our best interests he thought, and he meant well, but no matter what we said he would keep doing it.Finally as a joke someone said let's do the same thing to him, and for a week or 2 everyone would explain to him how to use for loops, the differences between MySQL engines, etc.He got the point and then some. He never fully stopped but for sure it decreased </p>\n",
            " <p>As a Senior / Lead Developer with a management degree here's the best way I've found and tested many times to deal with this sort of situation - assuming the person you're dealing with isn't just being evil.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Walk up to this guy and say \"Do you have fifteen minutes we could chat about something?\".</li>\n<li>Find an area out of the general flow of people (conference room is best if those are available) - Never give this sort of feedback in a public area; he'll get defensive and it won't have the intended effect of curbing the behavior.</li>\n<li>Use this formula: \"Lately it feels like you've been doing a lot of X.  When you do X it does Y.\"  </li>\n<li>In your case its; \"Lately it feels like you've been trying to help me out with a bunch of fundamental things I already know.  When you tell me things I already know, it makes me feel as though you don't value the experience that I do have which makes it harder to improve based on your feedback\".</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Bam.  This generally works for most level headed reasonably not-evil people.  If he is actually being a jerk about it; its time to raise that concern with your manager.</p>\n\n<p>He also may genuinely think you are at that level; which actually talking to him like this may help to change.  A lot of times its hard for seniors or leads to gauge where a developer is at; unless they have personally spent a fair amount of time with the person (or interviewed them for this purpose).</p>\n",
            " <p>The guy is possibly insecure, probably alot less paid than you and frustrated. His behaviour may be genuine but it definitely makes him feel senior to you, especially if someone overhears him 'coaching' you. I've been (and in many ways still am) in a similar situation. I just grinned and beared it for a while but that didn't work. Then I spoke to him about it. That worked for a week. The tipping point came when he actually complained about me as I was ignoring him more and more ( ' I'm too busy etc' ). Fortunately at that moment I'd gathered enough qudos on successful projects with the manager that the guy got shot down and put in his place after the next meeting. At which point I rather condescendingly put the boot in suggesting to my manager that perhaps his lack of professional behaviour was because he is frustrated about his job (which I genuinely believe). He is now known as someone who exhibits unprofessional behaviour and lost alot of respect. I defended his work recently to my manager and he thanked me for it. Which possibly even confirmed my 'seniority' over him, I don't know time will tell. But I also discovered that he has a very good reason to be frustrated, which means I've far more patience with him.</p>\n\n<p>There is no easier way to handle your situation as everyone is different. At the end of the day you've just got to be as professional and polite as possible. That doesn't mean you have to listen, especially if you are busy.</p>\n\n<p>Actually I just thought, maybe its even one of his objectives to 'coach' you!!\nIn that case maybe there is something else you can learn from him and ask him to redirect his 'coaching' to that instead. </p>\n",
            " <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Ask advanced questions.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I know how you feel as I, too, don't like it very much when someone tries to teach me something I <em>believe</em> I can teach others. I'm a dev, too.</p>\n\n<p>Let me sum up my perspective here:</p>\n\n<p>You say you are a dev. Being a dev means one and only one thing for sure: <em>there's always plenty to learn regardless of how much you already know</em>. </p>\n\n<p>You say that your <em>colleague</em> is a senior dev and you aren't yet you are on the same level in the team.</p>\n\n<p>Your colleague doesn't mean it to insult you when he gives you unsolicited advice. You think he means well.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, he is a senior in the company and that should mean that he knows things worth learning - you <em>too</em> want to be a senior dev some day, preferably some day soon. </p>\n\n<p>So, here's what I would do if I were you:</p>\n\n<p>Count to ten and in meantime try to control my anger and hurt feelings. </p>\n\n<p>and finally <strong>ask advanced questions</strong> once your coworker is done with the basics.</p>\n\n<p>My short and simple experiences as a dev tell me that <strong>nothing can gain you respect faster and easier than asking <em>good</em> questions</strong>. If you don't have questions, find a hole in your expertise you want to patch - I'm sure there's more than one. Then start asking.</p>\n\n<p>This will have some positive side-effects: you can get on good terms with your colleague very quickly. The willingness to help out will be used for good, and you'll learn new stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Or you'll come to discover that the basic level of advice is all your coworker is capable of and he'll bother you no more when he's failed to answer two or three well aimed questions of yours.</p>\n",
            " <p>There seems to be a bit of a case of narcissistic injury here. I understand why it might be frustrating to be have someone explain the basics to you when at your level you will have a firm grasp of them. You shouldn't let this turn into irritation towards the person trying to help you however. You do not know everything at this point so you are going to get advice and tips from time to time, a lot of them will be things you already know.</p>\n\n<p>I think the problem with this individual is he doesn't believe you're a professional. I'm sure there is some blame on his end, judging you by your age or not taking the time to learn your experience, but it may be you need to present yourself more professionally as you mentioned. </p>\n\n<p>Should he bring up a basic topic, respond with \"Yes, I've actually worked on this before in a similar situation X years ago.. have you thought about this approach?\" and give an example of your experience (without interrupting him). This will help show the person that you know your stuff and whether they continue to offer simple advice or not it will improve your relationship with them.</p>\n\n<p>It might be they're just the type who likes to offer a lot of advice and doesn't expect people to take offense. You may just have to get used to it and if that doesn't seem like an option you're just going to have to air it out with them, politely ask them to hold back on the advice as you see it as a distraction or unnecessary, being direct without being offensive and avoiding any passive-aggressive or petty responses.</p>\n\n<p>HTH</p>\n",
            " <p>You are describing what could be a paradigm shift: In his mind he may just be trying to be helpful, and he is unaware that he is making you feel talked down to. He may also just have the bad habit of being condescending to less senior people to try to assert his dominance. </p>\n\n<p>He should be paying more attention to your reaction and body langue and see if he is offending you. The fellow may not have highly developed social skills. You might want to try asking someone else what they think of him and they may confirm he is just condescending. </p>\n\n<p>Some people don't like to be given unsolicited advice. Giving poor or unsophisticated unsolicited advice is then adding injury to insult.</p>\n\n<p>This simplest thing to do is to politely and kindly tell him when he talks to you that way, you feel talked down to, and you don't like it. If you become hostile or aggressive during this conversation you may further strain your relationship. When you talk to him watch his face closely. Is he getting mad or frustrated or does he look concerned or apologetic?</p>\n\n<p>If he responds with anything but an apology then he has poor social skills, is trying to exert some lame dominance over you, or he is just condescending.</p>\n\n<p>Really it just sounds like he has poor social skills and is not up to speed on the principles and benefits of engagement. Proceed gently because he is in fact handicapped.</p>\n",
            " <p>Does he do this just to you, or to everyone?</p>\n\n<p>This may be a specific technique of keeping the team on the same page.  Those things you think are simple and basic - I guarantee there's some 30% of programmers out there that don't believe/agree with them. He may simply be showing agile team leadership by continuing to restate core values. This provides an opportunity for you and the rest of the team to either reinforce (\"Yes, we should always write unit tests\") or open for discussion (\"Well, but actually there is such a thing as too many unit tests\"). </p>\n\n<p>As you are new, he may be making sure to run through all the various existing shared team values to see if you're all on the same page and you are misinterpreting that badly. It definitely sounds like you are younger and value the independence part of the job more than the team part of the job. You should carefully reevaluate his statements through this lens, because from the agile engineering team manager point of view, \"great programmer who doesn't work well with his team\" is \"someone we regret more having to let go.\"</p>\n\n<p>Obviously just having a direct discussion with him about \"hey you keep telling me basic things and it makes me feel like you think I'm a dope, what's up with that\" will bring his real motivations out - I am not sure why you didn't do this within a week of this starting to bug you, and it reinforces my thoughts that something like the above dynamic is really in play here.</p>\n"

If you like the job and the only problem is that a senior member of staff politely offers you guidance that you don't actually need, you should seriously consider that there is no such thing as a perfect job, and if it isn't this annoyance at the next job, it will be something else.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry to say it but you <em>are</em> still quite young and haven't even been there 6 months.  It will take time to prove your skill and knowledge and value to this team.  If you quit now you'll be the new guy on some other team, and you'll have to prove yourself to them.  </p>\n\n<p>So, get a thicker skin and don't let the fact that this guy doesn't think you know what you're doing bother you.  Answer <strong>politely</strong> with phrases like, \"thanks, I did know that\" or \"yes, I learned that a couple of years ago when working on X\" etc. and resolve not to let it bother you.  You can't control his actions, you can only control your own reactions. Don't get offended.  Just observe to yourself \"hmm, Larry still doesn't think I know how to do X -- that's silly since he knows I did Y at my prior company, which I couldn't have accomplished without knowing X.  Oh well, I guess he just wants to be sure.\"  And then stop thinking about it, don't obsess over it, don't try to get him to stop, don't try to barge in and finish his sentences.  Just let it go.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a mutual boss, you might also go to him/her and say something like \"Larry insists on continually giving me programming pointers that I don't need, and at this point I'm starting to find it a little insulting.  Is there any chance you could encourage him to lay off a bit?\"  If there isn't someone obvious to have this conversation with, revert back to \"suck it up\" and manage your reaction. </p>\n",

Have a heart to heart to him as to why it's good to declare constants instead of having numbers throughout your code. Each time he offers you basic, unsolicited advice make sure you give him 2 ridiculous suggestions that same day. Within a week he'll stop.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: There was some element of hyperbole in there, but I've dealt with the type of people the OP has talked about.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>For a long time I was the only developer at my company.  Last year, we hired two more entry level devs.  I have no management experience or training and very few managerial duties, but by virtue of my seniority I am in a position of some authority and on paper they report to me.  Point is, calling me a terrible manager is not helpful.  I expect I am, but I want to know how to improve.</p>\n\n<p>We have a morning meeting where my team is expected to report to me their progress the past day and set goals for the new day.  I can then report to the boss (owner) what the team is up to.  The boss has repeatedly pushed to set an 8 am start for the work day, but this was unpopular and I have been able to hold our meetings to 10 am instead.  The meeting is consistently punctual.  If I call the meeting at 10:01 I consider myself late.  This is important to me since I feel that if I don't respect my own schedule why should the team?</p>\n\n<p>Lately (over the past few months), one of our team members has been consistently showing up for work later and later.  I didn't say anything since I don't want to send the message that obeying some clock is more important than getting your work done, and the employee has been consistently putting in his 40 hours a week (I can verify this, since we are required to punch a time clock).  My gut says that the quality of his work has suffered, but I do not have solid objective evidence of that.</p>\n\n<p>It has become a bit of a problem now though because he is showing up late for the morning meetings.  Once last week and now two days in a row last week.  I have asked him if there is anything going on or if he needs any sort of accommodation from the company.  He said no, that he was sorry and that he would try to be on time.   This was a couple weeks ago and he has not improved.  I have asked the other dev if he knows anything and he says he does not.</p>\n\n<p>At this point I do not feel that pushing the meeting back further will help.  All of us were able to make the 8:00 - 8:30 start time when the boss was breathing down our necks about it.  He knows it, we know it.  I am concerned that if I do not come up with a solution the boss will re-impose stricter rules and my team will lose some of the flexibility that we now enjoy.  What sort or carrots or sticks might I offer to prevent this from happening?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>I believe the answer is in your description of the problem. I would tell your developer that if he doesn't show up for the meeting at the regular time, the boss will set it back to the 8am timeframe, and that would be worse for everyone. Also asking (or reminding him) about the upcoming meeting next day at the end of the work day may also help, because it will show him that you care and it is important.</p>\n\n<p>If he continues to show up late, then you may have no choice than talking to your boss and possibly have a conversation (the three of you) about it to sort it out.</p>\n",
            " <blockquote>\n  <p>I don't want to send the message that obeying some clock is more important than getting your work done</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But in this case it is important, because not obeying the clock prevents work from getting done.</p>\n\n<p>Every minute he is late for the meeting is a minute you spend waiting for him. These are two minutes where you and the other worker are unproductive while on the clock.</p>\n\n<p>There are two possible courses of action:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Authoritarian approach: Make him understand that being late for meetings is wasting the time of you and your colleague and insist that he is punctual. Being on-time for meetings is part of professionalism.</li>\n<li>Diplomatic approach: Although 10am is already quite late to show up for work in most cultures, the time could still be inconvenient for him. You could push the meeting further back to ensure that everyone is present, like after lunch.</li>\n</ol>\n",
            " <p>The first thing I am thinking - why the quality of work is worse because he starts later? Also you said its just a gut feeling. So I guess now the first thing is to find out how to measure the real quality.</p>\n\n<p>If it turns out the real quality is bad, then just say him - we are going to cut your salary, because your quality is worse than it is needed for this salary. </p>\n\n<p>If it turns out that the quality is not getting worse, then I think there is no problem with him coming later - <strong>its an advantage of the company of having flexible hours</strong> and in result - happier worker, more loyal worker.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand - worker is not listening what the boss is telling him to do. There is good reason to tell - if you will not listen what we are telling - we don't need you at the company.</p>\n\n<p>There is another side of this problem. Is the company good enough for the worker so he cares about trying to be good worker. Chances are that he does not get what he wants from the company and maybe his salary is also not the one which makes him to be afraid of being fired, then the solution should be - to find out what he wants from the company to be happy and then ask from him seriously - if he stops being late - he gets what he wants from the company (if possible).</p>\n\n<p>One more thing - salary raise might not be biggest motivator. But with the bigger salary offer you can put advertisement that you are searching worker, one of the important requirements is - be at work not too late. And if you are lucky - you find better worker and problem is solved.</p>\n\n<p>Before putting an advertisement - again talk with the worker seriously - if he does not stop being late, then we are going to find new one and you will be replaced. And give him last chance to improve.</p>\n\n<p>I think good chances are that company is low on budget since it might be small company and so not possible to give big salary or other benefits.</p>\n\n<p>But then it would be the similar as asking - how can I get a Ferrari but having budget only for Opel Vectra.</p>\n\n<p>So if the company is not as good as it tries to find good worker, then probably it should just to be happy while he is working and bringing some profit even if it is not the highest possible profit. </p>\n\n<p>The Opel Vectra will not drive you to the destination at same speed as Ferrri, but it still will drive :)</p>\n\n<p>Or if you think its not profitable to keep him then again - fire him.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am not saying to do things blindly cause they might put negative effect. Those which I mention - is just to go through logical steps. </p>\n\n<p>For example - tell him we will cut salary - now we go to next step thinking - is it would it really be good or would it be bad. If this is not the case, then what else options we have. And so on. And then if we don't have any good options, then if he brings profit at least small - we keep him, if he does not - fire him.</p>\n\n<p>Also we need to think about long term profit and small term profit. And what are the chances that he will stay so we finally are at a time which we think is long enough term.</p>\n",
            " <p>As someone in development and oversees others there are things to be addressed here.</p>\n\n<p>The Boss wanted the meetings first thing in the morning (8am) and you as a team persuaded him to give you some freedom to push it to 10am... 10am is a very late start to the day in most of the world. Not being able to make it reliably to work by 10am is a problem.</p>\n\n<p>There are several ways to tackle this problem, all have their pros and cons to be considered. (I will be including some that are perhaps less ethical)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cause</strong></p>\n\n<p>WHY is this person chronically late? Do they depend on others for transportation? Have something they do before work that's been going long as of late? Feel there are no consequences likely to come of this? Simply not care anymore?</p>\n\n<p>There could be very valid reasons for the repeated tardiness. If you could get to the bottom of it to know \"Why\" you're better able to help resolve the problem. (Find an alternate form of transportation, set priorities, or take disciplinary action for example)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Authority</strong></p>\n\n<p>The authority approach tends to be the go to traditional approach. It's rather effective short term but really unpopular with the staff. Basically it's \"You need to be here by 10am or we'll find someone else who will.\" We all prefer to be good people who trust our employees to do the right thing with only a little prodding as needed, sometimes when people get complacent you have to give them a little kick to remind them they do have obligations to meet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Diplomacy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some people are very receptive to what is effectively bribery. Find something they want you can reasonably provide. Salary increases actually are only marginally effective here. (unless their underpaid) but everyone has something they want perhaps soda, coffee, the occasional thank you, etc. Find something this person wants you can offer... IF they can get to work on time reliably.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Exclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>A common tactic is provide a reason for the person to WANT to be there on time. fresh coffee, donuts, bagels, etc available at the meeting in limited quantities. Well meeting is at 10am break out the bagels then, if people are still hungry they eat a second one, if there's none left when he strolls in late, well that's just a shame isn't it?</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE: The below are NOT serious answers but will likely prove satisfying to the frustrated troll who wants to lash out inappropriate ways</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Evil Diplomacy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Diplomacy can also be used as a public shaming tactic. It's pretty shady stuff, but sometimes it's your most effective route. (might not work for you with such a small team) Offer to buy the team lunch IF EVERYONE shows up on time reliably for X amount of time. If this guy drops the ball it'll piss off his coworkers. Sometimes employees feel less guilty about letting down a supervisor then the person that works along side them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Even more Evil Diplomacy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Give some benefit to everyone who was on time reliably. Make the lunch proposition for the team, then say you felt guilty about not giving the team lunch because of one person's actions than take the rest of the team out without them. This is truly not nice stuff, and honestly is pretty lousy, but tends to bring things to head. (usually by that person quitting)</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Final Solution</strong> (yes I knew that's in poor taste)</p>\n\n<p>Start the meeting at 10am, when he strolls in late fire him on the spot. (assuming you have the authority to do so)</p>\n",
            " <p>This topic is a big favorite of mine, or more specifically: the topic of establishing \"rules of conduct\" for a team. A lot of times I see rules being established and enforced, without much thought being spent on the actual value of that rule. </p>\n\n<p>So what's the value of being on time, in other words having mandatory time where people are working? Most times, this boils down to being available for other people, so called office hours, or participating in meetings. If you can keep the mandatory available hours to say, 6 out of a total of 8 hours of daily work, in general you'll see an increase in productivity since people can adjust their working hours to the times they are productive. Both in the sense of morning people working earlier, as well as leaving early when you're having a bad day and staying late when you're \"in the zone\"</p>\n\n<p>So how to enforce the hours when we actually want people to be available? The principle to use here is to steal some warfare psychology: a soldier is not loyal to his generals (management), but to the people next to him in the trench (team members). So instead of saying \"I expect you all to be here from time x to time y every day\", gather the team and explain to them that you'd like to have 6 hours every day when they are available, and let them decide for themselves what these times should be. Reoccurring meetings should then be placed within the timeframe of these hours, and no one should get any criticism for being out of office outside of these times (with exceptions for specific meetings/commitments etc).</p>\n\n<p>And then to finally answer the question, how do you deal with a team member consistently showing up late? Gather the team every now and then (for instance the retrospective if you're doing Scrum), show them the list of rules that they themselves (with your facilitation) have come up with, and have them talk about which ones are not working and why. This will have a greater impact than any way you yourself can motivate/threaten/manipulate the teammember to show up on time</p>\n",
            " <p>When he says \"<em>no, that he was sorry and that he would try to be on time</em>\" he is telling you <strong>there isn't really a reason for him being late</strong>. At least, nothing he thinks you can help him with.</p>\n\n<p>Many workplaces have a flexible time schedule, but still have \"core hours\" which everybody should be present for. You could try implementing a similar rule.</p>\n\n<p>He may not understand the importance of being on time. If he gets his work done, so what? That is where you need to explain to him why it is important. (<em>assuming it is important</em>). Since it sounds like you did that already, and he is still being late, maybe it <strong>still isn't important to <em>him</em>.</strong> What repercussions will this behavior have on him if he continues to be late? The answer to that question may be \"important enough\" for him to start showing up on time.</p>\n\n<p>He could still have a legitimate issue - though if you follow the paragraph above and he still won't tell you why he has such a hard time then his issue could be something extremely personal <em>(<strong>Depression</strong> comes to mind - can make it difficult to get out of bed)</em>. He may just not like the job, or the people he's working with.  These would all affect his work performance as well. The problem with an issue like these is that he won't want to admit it and he may not even be aware of it, but so long as you ask if there is a problem and he says \"no\"... unless you see obvious signs that he needs help (<em>Which means, you should recommend getting help. Or even push him to get help</em>) there isn't much you can recommend or do about his problem - It may be he just isn't a good fit for the company.</p>\n\n<p>I would just try letting him know the consequences of his actions first. You seem like you are understanding and want to work this out with him. He should see that as well. Just know you may end up having to fire him if the cost of his lateness is too high.</p>\n",

Nobody can leave until it has been held. Schedule it for [length-of-meeting] minutes before whenever a 40-hour-a-week person would leave if they came in at 8. (If such a person would leave at 4, hold it at 3:45.]</p>\n\n<p>Now you can all talk about what you did today, and what you will continue to do if you're not leaving yet, and what you'll be doing first thing tomorrow before LateGuy is in. You can cover all the same bases as a morning meeting but without having to wait for LateGuy. What's more, the early people can take action at 8am if they learn from LateGuy that such action needs to be taken. </p>\n\n<p>If you do this, he is now free to have his flex time (within reason - he can't work 8pm to 4am or you wouldn't be able to have a meeting.)

            " <p>This article is directed at performance reviews, but the first half is describing the same \"late\" issue:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20141028123557-9522584-the-biggest-career-killer-of-all-time-the-performance-review\">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20141028123557-9522584-the-biggest-career-killer-of-all-time-the-performance-review</a></p>\n\n<p>\"Six months of lost potential because of one stupid comment about showing up to work on time.\"</p>\n\n<p>I doubt very seriously you are gathering any usable metrics meeting every single day, maybe change this meeting to one or two times a week and plan further ahead?</p>\n\n<p>Personally my team has a scrum meeting two times a week and we send daily emails detailing our workload/impediments. Pointless meetings are a productivity killer for a developer so my advice would be change the format of the information exchange and limit the face time so it becomes important and not just something to do.</p>\n\n<p>Some food for thought:\nI solve some of the biggest work problems laying in bed at 2 in the morning. I can't sleep if its on my mind, it keeps me up and I keep trying to solve it.  I wouldn't care to even remember the problem it if I'm worried its 2 am and I have to get to a meeting to talk about the crap I did yesterday instead of fixing things that matter.</p>\n\n<p>Enforcing strict time will get you the warm body in the door, but the brain is a far more valuable commodity.  Just my 2 cents.</p>\n",
            " <p>The first thing you need to do is discuss this with your boss.  There are two potential goals for this meeting </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Acquire the power necessary to take any action necessary to ensure compliance; or,</li>\n<li>Ask your boss to step in.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A \"manager\" who does not have hire/fire capabilities is, in my opinion, not really a manager.  The people you manage will ultimately walk all over you if they feel that you have zero ability to create or enforce the rules.</p>\n\n<p>So, if I were in your shoes, I'd go to the boss and ask him to empower me such that I actually have the authority necessary for the position I hold.  A good boss will give that to you.  Then you can have a private talk with the individual and explain to them that the work day starts at 9:00am or whatever it is you prefer.  </p>\n\n<p>If your boss is unwilling to give you such authority, then you will need him to step in and have this talk with that individual.  Certainly this path is easier for you, but, quite frankly, if you want a real management role you should be shooting for the first option.</p>\n\n<p>I understand developers often dislike working when the rest of the world is engaged; I was one for many years.  However, I also understand that there are a lot of reasons that being at their desk when the rest of the world is available can also be very important.  </p>\n",
            " <p>A conference call could be a viable option as an alternate way to attend. This would let you hold your meeting at a consistent time while allowing the developer (and perhaps others on your team) an easy way to participate if they find they are running late or can't physically attend.</p>\n",
            " <p>This is what is known as \"dollars waiting on dimes\" and is counter-productive. You are trying to manage your day as well as the team's so everyone needs to cooperate.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>obeying some clock is more important than getting your work done</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This meeting is part of getting work done. Communication is important.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have asked him if there is anything going on or if he needs any\n  sort of accommodation from the company. He said no, that he was sorry\n  and that he would try to be on time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He isn't keeping up his end of the deal. You can try and offer alternative times, but this person has no excuse for not keeping the time you have set; there may be problems he's not willing to admit like he has sleep issues. </p>\n\n<p>Be willing to work with him, but at some point, he is not allowed to waste your time. You have other things to do. I'm afraid a plan is going to need to set some realistic goals (no more than one missed day a week/month) and there have to be consequences for not complying.</p>\n\n<p>For whatever reason, your boss thinks this is important, so you should have support on being able to deal with this person. I hope it doesn't come to that. It seems like you're willing to be flexible and this person may be taking advantage of the situation. Also consider how he behaves at the meeting. Is he reluctant to talk with others? He gets things done so he should have any issues with not wanting to discuss any failures.</p>\n",
            " <p>I'm such an employee who likes to show up late. My reasons are that I like the nightlife I'm not a morning person and that I'm not satisfied with my job. </p>\n\n<p>If my manager were to give me an ultimatum 'show up on time or we will fire you', I would show up on time, but I would also be spending most of my time looking for another job. If he does not do that then nothing is likely to change. It might be a sign this developer thinks he is underpaid and he doesnt think his job is all that valuable. So before you issue such an ultimatum do a cost/benefit analysis (cost of replacement).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Clarification:</strong> I see three options for a manager dealing with someone like me:</p>\n\n<p>The softer approach is to mostly ignore the situation and maybe talk about it without issueing an ultimatum. this is what my manager does. This never hurts however it might not help very much. </p>\n\n<p>If the analysis turns out that the cost of replacement is less than the benefits of somebody showing up on time, then its good to go with a 'hard' approach and issue an ultimatum. </p>\n\n<p>The last option is if this person is not easy to replace and you really need him in your meeting at 10. Then you might consider the 'appeasement' approach and try to make a deal. Listen to what he wants so he will show up on time. What I do not recommend is a 'bluff' approach of issuing an ultimatum even if the cost of replacement is higher than the benefit of your dev showing up on time. </p>\n"

Our manager had already assigned responsibilities for both of us when we join this company.</p>\n\n<p>My background corresponds with all products in this company, in both collage and past working experience. However, he only knows how to operate the instruments, but does not know all the fundamental principles.</p>\n\n<p>At first, I was angry about his behavior - constantly interrupting whenever I'm talking, describing wrong concept/workflow/principle to customers and taking over my product line.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, he really is a nice guy, and is very friendly to me. I think he's not aware that he's doing something makes me uncomfortable. So I decide to keep a little distance from him.</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday, someone called him for instrument calibration.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Two years ago, my boss handed me my first annual salary adjustment letter. It was a substantial increase, retroactive to the beginning of the year.</p>\n\n<p>I filed it away. I noticed a pay bump, but because I also adjusted my 401k and insurance around that time, it wasn't obvious that I wasn't getting the full amount described on the adjustment letter.</p>\n\n<p>Doing my taxes the next year, I noticed my gross income didn't seem to match what I remembered that letter saying. I looked at my paychecks online and found that I was actually being paid <em>$5k less</em> than that amount. Unfortunately, I'd misplaced that letter, and started to suspect that I had just misread it. And it was still a decent increase, after all.</p>\n\n<p>My next annual salary adjustment hailed a \"raise\" of $2k (i.e., less than I originally thought I was making the year before). But again, I couldn't say for sure without last year's letter, and I was embarrassed to think I'd misread that sort of pay increase.</p>\n\n<p>After filing this year's salary adjustment letter, however, I found my original letter from 2017. It really does have that higher salary figure in black and white, and confirmed that number by saying it was \"an increase of $XX,XXX.\" I hadn't misread it after all.</p>\n\n<p>I brought all three salary adjustment letters to HR today and asked what happened. It turns out my manager asked for special permission to give me the larger-than-usual raise. In an email to HR, the CEO approved the smaller raise I actually got, but somehow that change never made it to the letter my manager ultimately signed and handed to me a couple weeks later.</p>\n\n<p>On the surface, it looks like an honest mistake on HR's part. And I should have been more diligent in following up when I noticed the problem, especially now that it's two years (and two salary adjustment letters) past.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Should I mention anything to my manager?</strong> Or just let it go?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I have a personal project (web app) which is going well and I think there's a realistic chance of it growing into a startup, at which point I would have to hire people.</p>\n\n<p>This would be the first time I've done anything like this. I've been daydreaming about what the hiring process might be like, when there's only me in the beginning. Technology interviews are notorious for testing people on things which don't necessarily predict the quality of the hire.</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking of doing something like this.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Candidate sends their CV, gets a phone call, and an interview on the order of, say one hour. So far so normal.</p></li>\n<li><p>If the interview goes well, the candidate is hired for up to one day (perhaps the same day), and paid by the hour for however many hours it ends up being. On this day they'd be given access to source code and development systems as if they were an employee and asked to do a few challenging and time-limited tasks which are actually relevant to the project.</p></li>\n<li><p>If the first day goes well, the candidate is hired for up to one week, paid per day for however many days it ends up being. Again they're asked to do actually relevant work, but this time they're not being time pressured and the tasks would be larger in scope. Here they'd be demonstrating their self-management skills as much as anything else.</p></li>\n<li><p>If the first week goes well they're given a normal contract, probationary for the first few months, and treated as a full employee.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The upsides to this process as I see it are that the candidate is being more thoroughly tested in the real work environment, and paying the candidate to do anything beyond a couple of hours' interview seems reasonable.</p>\n\n<p>I can anticipate the potential downsides of legal and managerial overhead, this looks like it will involve a significant upfront investment of effort to organise. Also for the first week the candidate could be fired at any moment, this might create a threatening atmosphere. For a one-man team which is just starting to expand, maybe this sets the wrong tone.</p>\n\n<p>Instinctively, this feels like a good idea, but I haven't heard of anyone hiring this way.</p>\n\n<p>Is it a good idea? Do you have experience seeing anything like this go well or badly?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>I don't think a 'one day contract' is a good idea.  I think that good candidates would not agree to do that for a startup.  They might for Google or Amazon, but not for [unnamed startup with zero employees].  </p>\n\n<p>It's also unlikely that you would get very much out of someone in just one day; unless you're doing something uninteresting that is more a commodity operation (i.e., setting up websites for people), it usually takes <em>some</em> time to get up to speed on the project in a useful fashion. Startups are quicker than most in this regard, but one day seems like a stretch. Employment paperwork takes time, after all, if nothing else.</p>\n\n<p>However, what you're describing is not all <em>that</em> unusual for companies with a somewhat longer probationary period.  You could possibly hire someone on a short contract, say one to three months, if they seem like good candidates. This is called \"Contract to Hire\" and means that after the contract term, you consider their performance and offer them a full time position if they meet your standards.  </p>\n\n<p>You still need to make some effort on the interview side, though; I personally think interviews are mostly just about identifying red flags and are mostly useless for identifying good candidates, so I wouldn't worry too much about that. Make sure the person knows how to program, look at their github depot, take them to lunch or coffee or a bar and see how their personality meshes with yours; that's enough.</p>\n",
            " <p>Most good programmers are already employed.  They're taking vacation time, realistically, to come to the interview.  You'd be asking them to take another vacation day to work with you (unless you plan on them doing their time-limited tasks after they put in a full day at their current employer).  Then you'd be asking them to take a week of vacation to work with you for a week which likely also takes some time to arrange.  And only then, after burning through a large chunk of their vacation hours, you would potentially offer them a probationary contract that would allow them to consider giving two weeks notice at their current employer.  That certainly reduces your risk of hiring someone that isn't going to be productive but it means that the candidate is taking a tremendous risk.  </p>\n\n<p>Of course, it creates a number of risks for you.  There is some intellectual property risk.  Depending on the candidate's current employment agreement, you might find that their current employer has rights to the code that they write for you.  There is a timing risk.  You're going to have to wait for them to arrange a vacation day and then to arrange a vacation week and then to put in their notice before they can stat their probationary contract.  That's a fair amount of waiting and coordinating.  If you're a slow-moving Fortune 500, that might not be a huge issue.  If you're a fast-moving startup, an interview process that stretches over a month or two would be problematic.</p>\n\n<p>If you decide that you'll only hire folks that are currently unemployed, which will severely restrict the pool of solid candidates, then you just have the logistical problems.  Getting a new employee set up is a fair amount of work particularly when you're going to measure their first day output and can't afford a hiccup when something doesn't work smoothly.  And there is a lot of employment paperwork that needs to happen to make sure that you do the proper witholding, send out the proper tax forms at the end of the year, you've got the appropriate NDAs an the like.  From the employee standpoint, the extra work involved in doing a single day of contract work may well cost them more in tax preparation fees than they'd make.  And that may interfere with their unemployment benefits.</p>\n\n<p>And unless you are doing something terribly repetitive and uninteresting, expecting someone to deliver a lot of value in a single day or a single week is probably optimistic.  People take time to come up to speed on an existing code base, understand your architecture, get their environment set up for maximum productivity, etc.  If you're just asking them to make small tweaks in very localized pieces of code based on fully developed specs, that might be enough time.  But that won't tell you a whole lot about their ability to do the more involved tasks that you're likely hiring them for.</p>\n",
            " <p>Go with a more 'normal' hiring process. Good employees are very wary about startups with unusual ways of doing things, most tend to 'unusual' themselves out of business (most startups fail).</p>\n\n<p>What you can do is use freelancers on specific portions and then if they measure up, offer them full time positions. Then you get the benefit of watching them do relevant work and you can analyse their work ethic, efficiency etc,. before hiring them. Basically works out the same as what you describe but without the hassles.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time use a normal hiring process to look for others. You're looking for someone reliable and competent, not an artist/genius type. The normal hiring process should show you who is/isn't (that's the reason people use it, that's what prospective employee's prepare for and it generally works).</p>\n",
            " <p>This 'one-day' stuff is not going to pan out.  Any seasoned developer worth his/her salt is only going to laugh at such an idea.  Additionally, I think it's advisable that you find out how much money it's going to cost you to get a person into a <strong>legitimate</strong> payroll system, do all the legal paperwork, locate desk space, and pay worker's compensation with the intent of having that all be in place for <strong>one</strong> day.  It is far from trivial and it's going to be a component for anybody running a business.</p>\n",
            " <p>I am retired now, however, I have been a technology consultant for 30 years and boot-strapped quite a few start-ups that have pioneered technology we would all easily recognize today. I have done this for myself and others.</p>\n\n<p><em>That being said, I have always recruited people I know and trust.</em></p>\n\n<p>You cannot trust people you do not know. For some of the start-ups, I recruited co-workers to work in the evening and weekends. This is surprisingly easy since people are always interested in technology and money. The point is, I never poached employees. However, if the start-up succeeded, then I was happy if they joined the company full time during the day.</p>\n\n<p>When projects were small and just starting out, each start-up would be given shares just like a corporation that allowed me to take a critical few programmers and offer them some ownership. This does two things. It gives them a stake in the success of the company. It also gives them an incentive to take a chance even for less money.</p>\n\n<p>However, to do this, you must be a good salesman, choose the very best of the best technologists you have access to, be able to consistently motivate and keep peoples interest, deliver a product in a timely manner, and finally, be truthful and trusted. These are good leadership skills you will need anyway so going through this process is extremely good exercise for the future. It is also not as easy as people think.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, the normal hiring process is fraught with risk. Hiring people you know and trust is far easier. However, sometimes people will disappoint you. So make sure you have an out. Put it all in writing. Make it official.</p>\n\n<p><em>Here is an example.</em></p>\n\n<p>I had an idea for a new point of sale (POS) that exists today. Pioneering a comprehensive POS that manages the entire business chain did not exist at the time. I began working on the core of the product. After 6 months, I hired a friend and gave him %50 of the product due to the level of participation he was engaged in. I needed the 6 months to create a proof of concept that people can see. It was a working product, even if it was not complete. When we needed expertise and help, we would peel off a small percentage of ownership for key programmers that filed in the gaps. This was from 1% to 5% max. We kept the personnel head count very lean. In the end, the intent was to sell the product to someone already in the business which we did. Each earned a significant income within a year. My primary partner and I earned our yearly income in just one year of part-time programming rather easily. We were highly paid at the time so it was a real boost!</p>\n",
            " <p><strong>I know a person hired similar way.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The process has been a bit simpler than what you suggest:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A thorough telephone interview.    </li>\n<li>A week test with real tasks, accommodation and expenses paid + plus a decent compensation.</li>\n<li>Usual (several months) trial period.</li>\n<li>Time unlimited contract.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The main difference to what you suggest was timing: between points 1, 2 and 3 there were several weeks pauses for the candidate to arrange her schedule and vacation time. </p>\n\n<p>It was a very specific case: the candidate was looking for a job but had not yet given notice (she was leaving the job on mutual agreement in no hurry) and her original employer was open to this sort of thing.

It's obviously frustrating.</p>\n\n<p>With respect, this kind of ugly project reflects the real world of software engineering. May I suggest you treat it as a career opportunity?  If you and your new helper can get it done, you'll both gain a lot of respect within your company. SO WILL YOUR MANAGER.  </p>\n\n<p>As you finish it, your manager will enthusiastically help you and your colleague advance your careers, because your success advances his career. Troubleshooters and problem-solvers are highly valuable people, especially in large bureaucratic organizations.</p>\n\n<p>So: enlist the help of your manager and your new colleague. Get them to share your frustrations. Be transparent about your successes and blockers. Keep pushing. </p>\n\n<p>Get it done. Then get your manager to help you look for a great new assignment. I know from experience this is very likely to work out well.</p>\n\n<p>(And, please understand this:  from your manager's point of view, your attempt to get away from this project is a threat to his career. If he can't retain his staff (you) to get this nasty job done, he looks really bad.) </p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I have a remote client that I'm contracted for adding new features to their training website. Half way through the project, my client notified me that some data was missing for a two month period (I was contracted during this period.) The client in question has very strict security policies. I am not allowed access to their servers or databases. One of their IT guys gave me a copy of their live database, so that's what I've been working with. I'm positive I'm not to blame, because I have no possible way to alter the live database, only my copy. My client is generally understanding, however, I feel that she doesn't understand the situation technically enough to see it wasn't my fault. How do I convey to her (without seeming more guilty) that it was not my fault? </p>\n\n<p>In addition, they want me to recover any data that is in my copy, which partially has the missing data. This is outside the scope of the project. How do I approach my client for addition hours? I feel she thinks it is within the scope because she isn't sure who/what caused the data to disappear.</p>\n\n<p>I value this client, and I hope to build a long term relationship, but I'm worried this situation will put that in jeopardy.</p>\n\n<p>Any advice on how to best handle this situation?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
