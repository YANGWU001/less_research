I was not the last candidate, so, by considering the last one, the search was closed one week ago. In the last meeting with the department chair, he said the department will select the final candidate next week and it seems they have made some decisions based on the information I have. I received an update this weekend from the department chair indicating that they are working with the dean's office and I should get an update this week. First, I interpreted this email positively in a way that probably I will be their first choice since they should keep all finalists on hold until the first candidate (assuming to be me!) signs the offer, which normally takes time (negotiation, salary, lab space, ...). So, there is no reason to notify me if I am not the first candidate.</p>\n<p>Then, I looked at this matter differently and thought maybe they already have offered another candidate and they are indeed waiting to get some approval from the dean for that person (probably the candidate has some requests). Because sometimes dean's office can approve the final candidate after a few days since it should not be a long process. I am not sure which case is more likely. I know that I should be more patient, but it is honestly difficult!</p>\n<p>So, my question is about your experience with the hiring process and its timeline.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

Decisions get made according to some opaque process of which only a small amount of detail is revealed to you, the candidate. But the bureaucracy of a university, and the dynamics of a job search involving multiple finalist candidates, are complicated, so the reality on the ground can involve a lot more that\u2019s going on than what you are being told. I don\u2019t mean a lot more necessarily bad stuff, or a lot more good stuff - just in general more people and more decisions (some perfunctory and some that are more uncertain) on which the outcome depends. Some of those decisions can be purely logistical or financial in nature (or even political) and quite far removed from the question of whether you are \u201cgood enough\u201d to get hired by university X.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is, if the department chair is competent then they have likely shared the maximal amount of information they can reasonably share with you at this point without risking misleading you into believing the outcome will be either better or worse than it might end up being. The only thing that\u2019s reasonably certain at this point is that you\u2019re still a viable candidate. For anything else, you\u2019ll have to wait for the black box to do its thing.

It makes no sense for it to modify \"work\". The paraphrase for the original question would likely be \"Please explain to me exactly how X works\", and in this paraphrase it is clear that \"exactly\" modifies \"explain\". The fact that \"Please explain to me\" has been elided in the sentence <em>while keeping the same meaning</em> should not suddenly be able to shift the attachment of this adverb. This goes well with the fact (at least fact in the way I perceive it) that \"exactly\" is kept apart from the sentence by the commas.</p>\n\n<p>Also, pet peeve: I hate the word \"adverb\". It is useless and misleading. Adverbs are modifiers that are not nouns or adjectives.

The basic operation isn't inherently wrong, at least for RSA, but thinking of signing as \"encrypting\" and verification as \"decrypting\" is going to lead to exactly the kind of confusion you are expressing here. It is much better to think of it this way:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>public</strong> key can be used for two things: <em>encrypting</em> and <em>verifying</em>.</li>\n<li>A <strong>private</strong> key can be used for two things: <em>decrypting</em> and <em>signing</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or, equivalently, you can say the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You can use your private key to decrypt a message somebody encrypted with your public key.</li>\n<li>You can use your private key to sign a message so that anybody who has your public key can verify the message is from you.</li>\n<li>You can send your public key to everybody, so they can send you encrypted messages and verify your messages.</li>\n<li>Unless you are sending a secret message to yourself, or verifying that it was actually you who wrote a message, you never use your public key yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the question you posed, the MitM doesn't need to decrypt anything, because the message was never encrypted at all! The message (or rather, a hash of it) was signed, so the MitM can't modify the message without breaking the signature, but the message itself is in plain text.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to both encrypt (provide confidentiality) and sign (provide authenticity), you need <em>your</em> <strong>private</strong> key (for the signing) and the <em>recipient's</em> <strong>public</strong> key (for the encrypting). That is, before Alice can send a secure message to Bob, she not only needs to generate her own keypair (for signing), she needs Bob to both have generated his own keypair and (verifiably) sent his public key to her (Alice). This is the pattern used by numerous secure messaging schemes, such as OpenPGP (including GPG) and S/MIME (both of which are primarily focused on end-to-end email security).</p>\n\n<p>Another option is of course to encrypt using a symmetric key that you have previously exchanged with the recipient (a \"pre-shared key\") and then also generate a message authentication code (MAC) using that key or another that you have also exchanged. This MAC might be hash-based (an HMAC, which combines a shared secret key with a secure hash algorithm such as a member of the SHA2 or SHA3 families), or might be derived from the symmetric cipher itself, such as an authentication tag out of a block cipher in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM). However, symmetric keys have no public component - it's never safe to do things like put them into a public certificate - so key exchange is somewhat easier (though still fraught!) when using public/private (asymmetric) keys instead.</p>\n"

                "content": " <p>During my last project, I used to have the same problem. I was thinking about the code during my commutes to home, before going to sleep and even as I was alone in the room with my girlfriend.</p>\n<p>That's when I knew I had to stop.<br />\nI have pretty much figured it out now, and here's my advice to you.</p>\n<h2>Get Positive</h2>\n<p>First, accept that you can't just <em>stop</em> thinking about the work out of the blue. This is a <em>habit</em> you have acquired, and habits don't disappear at your immediate will.</p>\n<p>However you can start by <strong>reshaping your experience into a positive one</strong>.<br />\nConsider this example of negative thinking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don't know which database design is better. The deadline is coming next week and I feel I can't make the right decision at the moment. We can't afford to hesitate and If I fail now, I will be the one to blame.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This leads you nowhere.</p>\n<p>It may sound trivial but if you suspect you don't work well enough, or worse, procrastinate, your conscience will revenge on you. <strong>It's five times as hard to think about work when you feel like you fail at it</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you're in this kind of situation, there is something you can do about it <em>right now</em>.<br />\nEssentially, there are two points to add to your workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you have something <strong>to be proud of</strong> every evening.</li>\n<li>Make sure you have something <strong>you <em>strive</em> to work on</strong> every morning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ultimate goal of this is to <strong>switch your obsession to a positive tone</strong>. You know the feeling when you go to sleep thinking about <em>that awesome code you wrote in just about three hours that solved all the world's problems and made the bunnies happy</em>? You're still obsessed but now you've made a major and very important shift.</p>\n<h2>Get Productive</h2>\n<p>Once you're in the positive stream, you'll find it easier to effectively constrain your tasks to the working hours. Try to plan them in such way that <strong>thinking about the problems in your free time doesn't add any value</strong>. Consider this example of positive thinking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This database design problem is an interesting challenge and I'll try my best to solve it. I know I'm usually more productive in the afternoon so I'll just have some tea now and fix a couple of bugs so I can give it my full attention when I'm at my best. Before leaving, I'll evaluate my results, and if I don't make a considerable progress, next morning I will ask for some advice from the more experienced colleagues and post a question on StackOverflow as well. I'll make the final decision by tomorrow evening.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What has changed? Now you pick your challenges and organize your working time in a way that makes sense <em>to you</em>. These eight hours are not just eight hours in your life, they are <em>special</em>, and you need to take advantage of them. Specifically, you need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn these eight hours into <strong>the Perfect Time\u2122  for problem solving</strong>.</li>\n<li>Make sure that <em>physically</em> being in the office <strong>empowers you</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second point is a kind of trick you can play on yourself. Ask your company to provide you with the best hardware. Do you have <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/04/three-monitors-for-every-user.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">three monitors</a> yet? I keep my favorite teacup at work, and I just <em>love</em> my armchair. I'd never want to solve a problem without it again. Okay, I made up the armchair thingie but the point is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you learn how to get <em>really</em> productive at the office, you will see that <strong>the habit of bringing work home eventually fades because nothing really <em>justifies</em> it anymore</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Get a Life!</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a <strong>great answer by pydave</strong> that does a better job of suggesting after-job activities.<br />\nYou must <a href=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/98986/how-do-you-stop-yourself-from-bringing-work-home/99134#99134\">check it out</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, seriously.<br />\nThinking about a database late night? How about going to a club instead? Watching a movie?<br />\nIf you're not the type of person to know how to spend time, ask your friends to take you out.</p>\n<p>I can't possibly remember how many times I was initially resistant to my friends calling me somewhere and then realized what a great time it had been and how I could've easily missed it out of the passivity. Now, even when work-related thoughts are buzzing in my head, if somebody calls me in my spare time, I just say \u201cI'm in!\u201d and get going.</p>\n<p>A great relief comes when you realize <strong>you're still going to do what you love the next morning and there isn't a single reason to think about it right now</strong>. So go ahead and find something else to muse on!</p>\n<p>Even when you're in love, after some time, you stop thinking about your significant other every single hour. This would have exhausted you. Instead, you split your free hours so there is a time for her (or him), there is a time for your friends and there is a time for you to be alone. There is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't apply the same principle to work.</p>\n<p><strong>Divide and conquer!</strong></p>\n"
