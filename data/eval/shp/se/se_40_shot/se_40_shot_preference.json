You don't own people. You established your relations with your network and these relations are still here.

Due to two incidents of equipment malfunctions (equipment that I am using), I was stopped from doing any experiments for more than three months in total. During the three months I did almost nothing. Over the entire 6 months that I have been here, I have only had one month during which I was able to generate any sufficient results (the other months I was learning the technique).  My supervisor rejected my proposal to switch to a new technique or use a different equipment set-up. What worries me is that I won't be able to gather sufficient results to write my thesis by July (which is the deadline), and I haven't even started my masters project.</p>\n\n<p>I am wondering whether anybody else has similarly experienced this situation before and whether this is normal during your PhD i.e. doing absolutely nothing for 3 months or more due to the excuse of \"equipment faults\"?

Could somebody please help me understand why my supervisor is doing this - is this normal for labs which lack funding? </p>\n\n<p>What should I do? Should I make a formal complaint to the university about my masters supervisor? If I do so, I am afraid that the animosity between me and my supervisor will be beyond repair and he will not support me at all in finishing in time for the deadline.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>To be specific, I just graduated with a Bachelor's degree, and my final project supervisor has asked me to co-author a paper with him about the subject of the project I did with his supervision.</p>\n\n<p>I'd love to join the research community, and I guess this would a be good starting point, but there are two issues I'm concerned about:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The first is related to the subject itself: (a) I'm not convinced of the quality of the suggested solution. (b) The project tries to solve two different problems.</li>\n<li>The second issue is that I'm not interested in the field of the project. My interest is in a different field. Though, both are related to computer science.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So, would participating in this paper do any harm to my reputation or my chances of getting into a good graduate program in the field I'm interested in?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thank you so much for the kind answers. Almost all of you agree that the second issue is harmless, but there are different opinions regarding the first one.</p>\n\n<p>So I said that my supervisor knows better, and I decided to go on and started planning the outline of the paper with his help. When I got to the writing part, I noticed that the main body doesn't relate to or even mention the main problem that we've specified. This is when I decided to decline the offer. It just doesn't feel right.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>Unless the paper to be published is plagiarized from a different source, I can't think of a case where a publication (in <em>any</em> field, even if its not related to your future field of research) would affect your career negatively in any way. Sure, if the quality/stature of the venue where this is published is not too high, few would take this paper seriously, but even then, it would be better than no publications at all (seeing that you are just completing a Bachelor's degree - my advice would have been completely different had you been a grad student, where the expectations are a lot higher).</p>\n",
            " <p>In short, unless there are ethical concerns, which is unlikely to be the case in computer science, then I'd say <em>no</em>. If you get some paper published as a Bachelor student, this demonstrates your ability to do research, which is what people in charge of admissions are interested in. If the paper gets accepted at a good venue, then this is even better.</p>\n\n<p>At the current stage of your career, your main concern should be getting into a good graduate program. After you write more papers, better ones on the topic you choose, no one will even worry about that first paper.</p>\n",
            " <p>I somewhat disagree with the previous answers. I think it is largely improbable that publishing a paper would harm your career, but it could if, for example, it is really poor and someone happens to read it. </p>\n\n<p>Eykanal in a comment to Dave Clarke said that \"no one would consider holding you accountable for the content of the paper\"; I recall that there is a important trend to insist that <em>all authors of a paper should be accountable for its content</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that you do not want to pursue in the direction of the paper is completely harmless, though. There is really no problem working in different areas, the only thing to be careful about is not to spread oneself efforts too much, but this does not apply here.</p>\n\n<p>So the main issue is (a); here I would say that it can be difficult to judge the quality of a result, especially for an undergraduate, and I would advise to trust your advisor. So it is really, really unlikely that co-authoring this paper could do any kind of harm to your career; in fact it could do more harm to decline this opportunity, since your advisor would probably not understand and you will probably need his or her recommendation.</p>\n\n<p>At the end, I do not disagree that much with other answerers; but I would be less general in my statements.</p>\n",

If it may not, then you need to work things through with your co-author until you agree on whether or not it does solve the problem.</p>\n",
            " <p>Short answer, it is very unlikely that it will hurt you.</p>\n\n<p>If you submit a paper to a conference, you get to see the reviews that will tell you what needs to be improved or not. If in the end it was accepted while being a low quality paper, it is the conference committee's problem not yours.</p>\n\n<p>In researchers' profiles, you can write down: \"Selected publications\" instead of putting the whole list. Most of the time people will just appreciate that you've written a paper, and even more so if it is at a reputable conference. No one has the time to read the paper unless he/she is actually interested in the topic. There's no sort of \"Hall of Shame\" for publications. </p>\n\n<p>You will learn, that's for sure. It is very unlikely that it will hurt you.</p>\n",
            " <p>Minimum conditions for ensuring this - or any other - paper doesn't hurt your career:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The research findings must be sound.</strong> don't get tempted into writing, or being listed as a co-author for, papers presenting research when you're \"not convinced about the quality\" of the research findings; or 'fluffy' papers which don't really present much at all; or mere rehashes of other results etc.</li>\n<li><strong>The paper must be relatively well-written</strong> - both in terms of language and in terms of structure and narrative flow. Now, I say 'relatively' because this is often hard to get right with the pressure of time and page limits; and with English not being the native language of most researches. So, readers will be somewhat tolerant about this point - but if you write something that is just very hard to follow, or in very poor English, that doesn't reflect well on you.</li>\n<li><p><strong>Unfortunately, attention must be paid to the venue of publication.</strong> I must first qualify that... obviously some publications are more highly-regarded w.r.t. their filtering process and the typical quality of articles they carry, and some less so. The thing is, I believe one should not assume that if a paper is published in a 'weaker' journal, that necessarily means it's bad - and if someone is evaluating your qualifications as an academic they should bother to skim the paper itself and make up their own mind. That doesn't always/often happen, so people may well judge your work by looking at where you've published. Of course, this is not something binary (\"good\" journals and \"bad\" journals, or conferences) -  but having mostly obscure venues in your list of publications does reflect poorly on you, and in some fields I guess there are venues you should actively avoid even at the price of no publication.</p>\n\n<p>Having said all that - for your first publication, as long as it's not a disreputable venue, it doesn't matter much. Most people \"start out small\".</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The last point, about venues, is also a sort of a safety guarantee for you: If you submit a paper to a conference or journal with a good peer-review process, and you're accepted, then it's highly likely that your paper is actually pretty good, and even more likely that it will reflect favorably on you (the converse is not necessarily true of course; lots of good papers get rejected).</p>\n"

But I think it is perfectly okay not to respond. First of all, you are one of a long list of recipients, so it would be quite unreasonable for Prof. B to expect each and every recipient of the email to set aside their work and life to dedicate themselves to studying in detail the situation he is describing and then write an equally detailed reply. Basically, to put it bluntly, Prof. B's email can be reasonably classified as spam and there is certainly no obligation to reply to it in any way.</p>\n\n<p>Second of all, you are on sabbatical, which is a sacred time you should devote to nurturing your own interests and passions and ignoring the daily trivia and tedium of academic life. The case for not responding is therefore even stronger (to the extent it needed any strengthening). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Should I inform Prof. A that I found this email inappropriate?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, you have been implicated in this business completely through the actions of others and have no duty to take any action. If you feel strongly enough about the inappropriate email that you feel compelled to write to Prof. A, go ahead. But there is absolutely no need to do so.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Should I just do as if I haven't read this email?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wouldn't falsely pretend that I haven't read the email, if that's what you mean - that would be dishonest and unprofessional (and besides, you have now documented publicly your knowledge of the email ;-)). Nor would I plan on saying (as Wolfgang Bangerth suggests in his answer) that I deleted it since it was \"none of my business\" (I don't think that unethical behavior by others is none of my business - it would be perfectly appropriate to consider it my business if I were so inclined). But as I said it would be completely appropriate to file the email away (or delete it, as you prefer) and take no further action. Whether you <em>should</em> do that depends on whether you are interested in getting involved in the story.</p>\n",

As a part of the process I am currently trying to update and freshen my CV, linked-in profile etc. </p>\n\n<p>I noticed that I am having difficulties in fitting into the existing templates when describing my profile. My work is of a rather <a href=\"https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/10798/interpretation-of-a-phd-degree-in-a-very-broad-interdisciplinary-field\">interdisciplinary</a> nature, in a research group that is not very close to what the other research groups within the department work with. </p>\n\n<p>So say my research groups is working on <em>Bowling</em> and our department is named <em>Joggling</em>. This rather odd organization of research groups is due to the \"common use\" of bowling pins. In this rather silly metaphor, my own research would be on <em>Wood wax</em>, relevant for bowling but not so much for circus trickery. So calling myself a \"PhD in Joggling\" would be extremely misleading when looking for jobs, whereas \"PhD in Woodwax\" is technically lying. </p>\n\n<p>Given space, I can describe what I do and effectively dodge the bullet by something like \"<em>I have a PhD from Department of Joggling, focusing/working on Woodwax</em>\".

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I know this is a topic that some people have strong opinions about, but a toxic culture is developing in my department whereby several postdocs have convinced themselves that they are being mistreated because of extremely small -- often imaginary -- confrontations.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a postdoc encountered a senior staff member in a doorway. The staff member apparently gave her a \"funny look\", which confirmed the postdoc's view that this staff member is abusing their position of privilege. Anyone who points out that this is a total non sequitur is accused of allowing bullying to flourish. </p>\n\n<p>This situation has been building steadily over the last few years and now five or six postdocs keep a running tally of \"microaggressions\" so microscopic that it is very difficult to see how they can exist. For example, one postdoc sits with their back to a door, and a professor came in to talk to another colleague, and didn't acknowledge them. This incident was talked about for weeks as evidence of the professor's \"rudeness\". In other cases, some people are labelled \"creeps\".</p>\n\n<p>To be clear: I absolutely do not condone abuse. I know power dynamics are real, and that many minorities (of which I belong to several) experience daily microaggressions and othering. I have been on the receiving end of workplace bullying myself, and would never wish to silence real problems. I too am a postdoc, so have no additional power and gain nothing from allowing abuse to flourish.</p>\n\n<p>What worries me is that none of these incidents are being raised with any of the staff members in question. Therefore, many junior researchers have accepted as fact that their professors are horrible and selfish people. I'm concerned about this mindset, because in at least three cases, these \"selfish\" professors have some form of autism (I know this as I'm a wellness officer). Perfectly ordinary behaviour is framed as malicious.</p>\n\n<p>Personally I've found it very upsetting. Many of the people on the receiving end of this gossip are very kind, if not socially awkward, people. It scares me that so many people uncritically accept that everyone with a permanent job is some kind of bogeyman; of course, I cannot betray confidentiality by informing my colleagues that many of these incidents didn't occur and indeed it's kind of ableist to assume you can read minds all the time. Abuse and power struggles certainly can, and often do, occur... but if any of these complaints were substantial they should be raised with HR. </p>\n\n<p>The sad truth is that I think my colleagues just get their power from trash talking others, and aren't actually interested in the truth. Dissenting voices get shunned (and accused of being privileged / not being woke). Anyone who isn't in 100% agreement gets immediately shut down. But, also, my colleagues are just upsetting themselves for no reason. They're scared of encountering these \"terrifying\" professors, most of who have done nothing worse than dressing slightly shabbily and being uncomfortable with eye contact. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone have any advice on dealing with this kind of situation?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

For example, you could suggest a work-in-progress monthly session where PhD students and postdocs once a year or so talk about their work.

            " <p>For dealing with this kind of issue, I recommend looking at the rules for bullying and harassment <em>from both ends</em>.  It is settled law that rules on workplace bullying protect both junior employees from senior employees, but also protect senior employees from junior employees.  Moreover, to sustain a complaint of workplace bullying and harassment, this requires some ongoing or serious acts; it is not established by trivial isolated incidents of the kind you are describing (i.e., so-called \"microaggressions\").</p>\n\n<p>If your description is correct then a formal complaint of harassment for these \"micro-agressions\" would almost certainly not meet the requirements to be sustained.  In view of that, the people making the complaints must be careful that their own characterisations of senior staff, and their own rumour-mongering, does not <em>itself</em> amount to bullying and harassment.  In particular, referring to other staff members as \"creeps\", if done repeatedly and without any legitimate basis, could certainly amount to bullying.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of advice, that is where it gets tricky.  If someone is subject to name-calling and rumour-spreading they have the option to document this and put in their own complaint of bullying, even if they are a senior person and the bullying is coming from a junior colleague.  Ultimately you will need to think about what level of confrontation with this issue is desirable, and whether the staff in your department would be more amenable to an informal discussion to reduce tensions, or a formal complaint process where bad behaviour is dealt with through formal channels.</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I am about to finish an undergraduate degree, with a good enough GPA that even if I got C's in all of my current classes, my final overall cumulative GPA would remain above 3.6.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming I graduate with all the whistles in my diploma it would be:</p>\n\n<p>Honours Bachelors of science in computer science with distinction and a minor in pure mathematics (quite pompous).</p>\n\n<p>In order to complete all of those whistles I had to do supervised research for two semesters. Being a naive undergraduate, I knocked on proffessor's doors, asking for a supervisor, and one of them, very generously agreed. He suggested a problem I thought was interesting and so I started the research. I originally started throwing analysis at the problem, and started trying to solve some really complex differential equations (which kept me motivated). However I did not make much progress, so after my supervisor marked that I needed to get something, I fully changed my approach and started using some geometric approximations to solve the issue. This generated some results, but was too simple. I'd like to say that my results were inversely proportional to how much effort I was putting in the research.</p>\n\n<p>Time passed, I had multiple potential solutions and a way to evaluate them. On the last week before the final submission I realised there was a bug in my code base that was destroying the results (they were mathematically impossible). I tried to find the error, but the best I could do was identify an area where a mistake could have happened. </p>\n\n<p>Finally I got my evaluation on the course after presenting it. The feedback said the methods were a bit naive and could be improved on, and it was dissapointing that I didn't get numerical results (I had visual results, not numerical), however since I was not a seasoned researcher they decided to be lenient and gave me an A anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I applied to the grad program at my university, and asked the same proffessor to be my supervisor for the grad program. I am in desperate need of financial support until the grad program starts, and so my supervisor said I could do summer research for him and in the meanwhile we could discuss what the grad project could be. What he wants me to do is finish my previous work and get a publication. </p>\n\n<p>The issue is that I legitimately feel that dinking bleach would be more motivating (I am using this metaphor to convey just how much anxiety this is giving me). This research really does not appeal to me in any way or form, and the interesting part is over, all that is missing is finding the bug, which could take more than two weeks to solve and implementing a couple of modifications to make my naive methods less naive if things go well, or complete failure to finish it in the worst case.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to that I have been doing independent research simultaneously as I have been taking courses and doing everything else. Although this independent research still needs a lot of work, it's in a good place, I have already improved many of the papers I have read and have multiple ideas to explore. In an ideal world I would win the lottery tomorrow and I could just support myself while I carry on with this research.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure how to approach my supervisor and tell him I don't want to finish this research, nor how to suggest to do my research instead and get a publication out of that, or even if I should touch on this topic at all.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

I know a few people (maybe half a dozen) in CS who would be suitable as advisors, depending on your interest.</p>\n<p>There is a special category of faculty at some top US universities called, perhaps, &quot;Professor of the Practice&quot;. They aren't tenured (or tenurable), but serve on long term renewable contracts (about seven years). The ones I'm thinking of hold solid doctorates themselves, but are primarily responsible for teaching undergraduates. They all do research themselves, but it is more likely to be in something like pedagogy of their field. They are quite prominent in the (CS) profession and are frequently seen at conferences, and such. For these few people, having them as an advisor would be safe enough.</p>\n<p>I don't know if there are similar situations elsewhere and, even here, they are a bit uncommon, though they tend to occur at top universities (Stanford, Duke, ...).</p>\n<p>And note, that I haven't asked any of them if they have done such a thing.</p>\n<p>But, for the general case, it would be quite risky. They might leave for other reasons than getting fired. If their main subfield isn't mainstream you might have trouble finding another advisor to take their place, necessitating a change of field or a move. Much better to have someone with stable employment and the time necessary to give you proper guidance. Even non-tenured, but tenure track, people can fail on that.</p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Spent a few hours searching on Google and in other forums - I know this issue has come up before, but I couldn't find a single answer or solution anywhere.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that when I go to print the calendar (or turn it into a PDF) it decides to completely randomly re-order my events. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to it. In iCal they are in a perfectly logical, organized order.  When I go to print, they appear randomly mixed around.</p>\n\n<p>I have attached some photos: The first is from iCal, second is what the pdf looks like. Note that not only does it re-order the events from the way they appear in iCal, but the way it is re-ordering the events appears to be changing at random from day to day: compare the blue events on the 17th and 24th in image 2 - these events are repeating weekly events and were not entered into the calendar manually. There is absolutely nothing different about the events on the 17<sup>th</sup> and the 24<sup>th</sup>, yet they appear in a different order on each of those days. The orange events are not repeating events and were each entered manually on their given days, but they too are being re-ordered randomly from day to day. I've noticed that this isn't just an issue for all-day events - the exact same problem occurs when multiple events occur at the same time (8am, for example).</p>\n\n<p>Has this just been accepted as an unfixable issue? Super frustrated, spent hours putting a year-long call schedule together for my residency program only to find it's a confusing mess when I try to print it or turn it into a PDF. If there is no solution, does anyone have suggestions for an easy to use app that I <em>can</em> use to generate a PDF calendar that looks similar?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rw00o.jpg\" alt=\"Calendar.app\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XSCgA.jpg\" alt=\"PDF\"></p>\n\n<p>I am using a MacBook Pro with 10.7.5 installed.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>The problem here is that your IFROGZ Toxix Wireless do not support Headset profile (HSP). They only support Handsfree profile (HFP) as can be seen in your bluetoothctl output.\nPulseAudio on the other hand does not support HFP out of the box, as is explained here: <a href=\"https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/Bluetooth/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/Bluetooth/</a></p>\n<p>So your only options are to install oFono or to patch and compile PulseAudio yourself. Patch is available here: <a href=\"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pulseaudio/pulseaudio/-/merge_requests/94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pulseaudio/pulseaudio/-/merge_requests/94</a></p>\n",
            " <p>I was facing the same issue with Oneplus Wireless Z Bass edition. My headset microphone was not detected by PulseAudio and the problem is that my headphones  don't have HSP profile, only HFP profile. After trying for 2 days, I came to the solution of replacing PulseAudio with Pipewire sound server, which supports HSP, HFP and A2DP by itself. So there will be no need to install any other utility like <code>ofono</code>, <code>phonesim</code>. Also, to be noted that my problem wasn't resolved even after following all the steps to configure <code>ofono</code> in PulseAudio. So I came up with the steps to replace PulseAudio with PipeWire.</p>\n<p>Here is the detailed article I have written to resolve this problem, the steps of which I'm also adding here. You can follow it and most probably be able to solve your problem.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://atish3604.medium.com/solved-bluetooth-headset-mic-not-working-detected-in-ubuntu-20-04-86a5236444d0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bluetooth headset microphone not detected</a></p>\n<p>Open your terminal and follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>We will use a PPA for adding Pipewire to Ubuntu 20.04, which is maintained regularly:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pipewire-debian/pipewire-upstream\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>To update the PPA packages in your system do:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt update\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Install the package:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt install pipewire\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>There is also a dependency needed to be installed with Pipewire, otherwise you will face the issue of <em>\u201cBluetooth headset won\u2019t connect after installing pipewire\u201d</em>. Install the dependency by:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt install libspa-0.2-bluetooth\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Now, to install the client libraries:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt install pipewire-audio-client-libraries\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Reload the daemon:</p>\n<pre><code>systemctl --user daemon-reload\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Disable PulseAudio:</p>\n<pre><code>systemctl --user --now disable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you are on Ubuntu 20.04, you also need to \u201cmask\u201d the PulseAudio by:</p>\n<pre><code>systemctl --user mask pulseaudio\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I am not sure but, if possible, you can try to run this on other versions too.<br>\n9.     After a new update of Pipewire, you also need to enable <code>pipewire-media-session-service</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>   systemctl --user --now enable pipewire-media-session.service\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li><p>You can ensure that Pipewire is now running through:</p>\n<pre><code>pactl info\n</code></pre>\n<p>This command will give the following output, in Server Name you can see:</p>\n<pre><code>PulseAudio (on PipeWire 0.3.28)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Things should be working by now and you can see your microphone.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If it doesn\u2019t show up, then try restarting Pipewire by this command:</p>\n<pre><code>systemctl --user restart pipewire\n</code></pre>\n<p>If it\u2019s still not showing your microphone, you can try rebooting once and remove and pair your Bluetooth device again to check if it works now.</p>\n<p>I hope I have helped you solve your problem.</p>\n<p>If you want to rollback all the changes we did, you can do it by using:</p>\n<pre><code>systemctl --user unmask pulseaudio\nsystemctl --user --now enable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket\n</code></pre>\n",
            " <p>There main reason the HFP profile is not available is the Pulseaudio drivers have removed support for it. Any Bluetooth device can now only connect via A2DP configuration which does not support on-device microphone. I myself had the same problem and had spend around a week to figure out the solution that works without much hassle. You can follow the instruction mentioned at <a href=\"https://eternalgeek.in/index.php/2021/06/13/solving-mic-of-wireless-earbuds-not-working-on-ubuntu-20/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://eternalgeek.in/index.php/2021/06/13/solving-mic-of-wireless-earbuds-not-working-on-ubuntu-20/</a></p>\n<p>Hope this helps and save time at your end!</p>\n"

        "sft_target": " <p>I was facing the same issue with Oneplus Wireless Z Bass edition. My headset microphone was not detected by PulseAudio and the problem is that my headphones  don't have HSP profile, only HFP profile. After trying for 2 days, I came to the solution of replacing PulseAudio with Pipewire sound server, which supports HSP, HFP and A2DP by itself. So there will be no need to install any other utility like <code>ofono</code>, <code>phonesim</code>. Also, to be noted that my problem wasn't resolved even after following all the steps to configure <code>ofono</code> in PulseAudio. So I came up with the steps to replace PulseAudio with PipeWire.</p>\n<p>Here is the detailed article I have written to resolve this problem, the steps of which I'm also adding here.

After a new update of Pipewire, you also need to enable <code>pipewire-media-session-service</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>   systemctl --user --now enable pipewire-media-session.service\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li><p>You can ensure that Pipewire is now running through:</p>\n<pre><code>pactl info\n</code></pre>\n<p>This command will give the following output, in Server Name you can see:</p>\n<pre><code>PulseAudio (on PipeWire 0.3.28)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Things should be working by now and you can see your microphone.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If it doesn\u2019t show up, then try restarting Pipewire by this command:</p>\n<pre><code>systemctl --user restart pipewire\n</code></pre>\n<p>If it\u2019s still not showing your microphone, you can try rebooting once and remove and pair your Bluetooth device again to check if it works now.</p>\n<p>I hope I have helped you solve your problem.</p>\n<p>If you want to rollback all the changes we did, you can do it by using:</p>\n<pre><code>systemctl --user unmask pulseaudio\nsystemctl --user --now enable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket\n</code></pre>\n",

I have tried taking LUKS out of the LVM and putting it on sda2, and the results were the same. I also know that the keyscript works because <code>cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/vg0/secure secure -d - &lt;&lt;&lt; \"$(/lib/cryptsetup/scripts/insecure)\"</code> works like a charm and decrypts my LUKS partition.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried this in Ubuntu 16.04.2 and Ubuntu Mate 16.04.2 with the same results. I've used keyscripts before without any trouble. The only difference was that, in the past, my / partition was always encrypted. If anyone can shed some light, I'd appreciate it. I only want a very small encrypted partition because I plan on cloning this system, and I don't want to clone it with the entire / partition encrypted.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2017-04-26</strong></p>\n\n<p>In digging through logs, I found a line with the following error which makes no sense.

In fact, I tried other options like keyfile-offset, and they work too. Hence, the problem lies somewhere with the keyscript option. Does anyone have any idea why?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

May be different for Lubuntu etc.)</p>\n<pre><code>Section &quot;InputClass&quot;\n    Identifier &quot;middle button emulation class&quot;\n    MatchIsPointer &quot;on&quot;\n    Option &quot;Emulate3Buttons&quot; &quot;on&quot;\nEndSection\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The very anoying malfunction of a missing 3rd mouse button (touch pad, <strong>Marble Mouse</strong>) can actually be fixed with the\n&quot;gpointing-device-settings&quot;. Just install using CLI with:</p>\n<p>apt-get install gpointing-device-settings</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then invoke <code>gpointing-device-settings</code> to get the gui window.\n<strong>Remark</strong>: There is an unfixed bug in newer Ubuntus that wipes out your settings when rebooting. You may put <code>gpointing-device-settings</code> in auto-start but still need to prompt then. I am not aware of any proper config solution.</p>\n<p>Probably some steps need a sudo or root access. I assume you know.</p>\n<p>However, now I can use the unixish copy paste by mark and middle mouse button. At least in terminal.\nAnd for the Marble Mouse there is a separate article with a lot of config details.</p>\n<h2>Addendum</h2>\n<p>With Ubuntu 17 and in XFCE the middle mouse button copy paste did not work at all.</p>\n<p>Wayland is different.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it is helpful to enter</p>\n<pre><code>gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.mouse middle-button-enabled true\n</code></pre>\n<p>With some luck it is persistent.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I have an old Compaq Presario CQ60.  This was running Windows Vista when I obtained it, but I've since switched it to Kubuntu 21.04.  It should be noted that when I tested Vista, it worked fine.  The switch was to go to an OS that was a bit more modern, and to remove any crud from the previous owner.</p>\n<p>The problem that I have is that KDE regularly and randomly becomes unresponsive.  By unresponsive I mean the mouse moves, yet clicking on anything has no effect.  Keyboard input is ignored.  When this happens, the only course of action is to hit the power button to switch the machine off and then reboot it.</p>\n<p>I've switched over the compositor from OpenGL 2.0 to XRender.  For a brief while this appeared to help.  I've tried enabling the <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Backspace</kbd> key combination to kill the XServer session.  When it's locked up, that key combination does nothing.</p>\n<p>It is impossible to check resource usage because there is no way to get to a terminal or other application with the machine not responding to keyboard input or mouse clicks.  It is entirely possible it's related to RAM usage (it has the required 2gb minimum, I've got an upgrade coming, just need to wait for it to arrive) but it's really difficult to say that with any certainty at least until I can get it upgraded.  Having said that it can be as little as 30 seconds after login before the whole thing becomes unresponsive.</p>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, running this on Windows Vista appeared fine so it looks like its related specifically to the KDE installation.  And yes I know the machine is a little bit old, the whole purpose of the machine is as a portable word processing box so it hardly needs to be a powerhouse and I've always considered Linux a great option to extend the life of older hardware.</p>\n<p>Is the limited RAM situation likely to be the main cause of this, or are there other things I can investigate?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

An extremely brief synopsis of the archetypal shaggy dog story is as follows (quoted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaggy_dog_story#The_archetypal_shaggy_dog_story\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A boy owned a dog that was uncommonly shaggy. Many people remarked upon its considerable shagginess. When the boy learned that there are contests for shaggy dogs, he entered his dog. The dog won first prize for shagginess in both the local and the regional competitions. The boy entered the dog in ever-larger contests, until finally he entered it in the world championship for shaggy dogs. When the judges had inspected all of the competing dogs, they remarked about the boy's dog: \"He's not that shaggy.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The specific events in the story might change every time you tell the story; it's more like a template for improvisation than a set narrative. Properly told, this story could last five, ten, or even fifteen minutes. You can imagine the anticlimax at the end. The teller, leading up to it, might begin to feign repressed giggles, cover his or her mouth for a moment, and generally behave as if the coming punchline is the funniest thing imaginable. </p>\n\n<p>This doesn't seem to be a <em>perfect</em> translation, since the kinds of jokes you're talking about might not be that long; a shaggy dog story is almost always long. Still, the concept seems quite similar to me.</p>\n",
            " <p>I don't know if we have a word for it, but we certainly have a well known phrase to describe the reaction:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You have to laugh, or else you'd cry...</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
            " <p>It's the <em><a href=\"http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/laughing-stock\" rel=\"nofollow\">laughing-stock</a></em> &ndash; so bad, it's funny.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>someone or something that seems stupid or silly, especially by trying to be serious or important and not succeeding </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>An invention of the Bard himself.</p>\n",
            " <p>As requested in the comments, I am providing <em><a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/groaner\" rel=\"nofollow\">groaner</a></em> as an answer.</p>\n\n<p>Occasionally, a person will tell a joke, and when he gets to the punchline, the listeners realize that they have been suckered.  It ends with an anti-climax, a horrible pun, or some other unexpectedly un-funny result.</p>\n\n<p>The reaction is then a cross between a laugh and a groan.  On the one hand, you have disgust over the joke, yet an acknowledgement that it does have a certain bit of wit behind it.  You also simultaneously have the sense of shame-on-you toward the joke-teller for taking you in, while also giving credit for having done so, a sort of \"Aha, you got me.\" kind of moment.</p>\n"

She read several books on the subject, and finally, after purchasing all the necessary equipment, she went onto the ice. After positioning her comfortable stool, she started to make a circular cut in the ice. Frighteningly, from up above, a voice boomed: 'There are no fish under the ice.' Startled, Mrs. Baker moved farther down the ice, poured herself a large coffee, and began to cut yet another hole. Again, from the heavens, the voice boomed: 'There are no fish under the ice.'  Mrs. Baker was now very concerned, so she moved way down to the opposite end of the ice, set up her stool, and began again to cut her ice-hole. The voice rang out once more: 'There are no fish under the ice.' Mrs. Baker stopped, looked upwards and said, 'Is that you Lord?' The voice replied, 'No, this is the ice-rink manager.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I found the above text in one of the past papers of the Kangaroo English competition. However, one of the questions baffled me. It asked how many holes Mrs. Baker had dug.   </p>\n\n<p>According to my knowledge of the English language,  I put down that she had not dug any holes, as she had never completed the act of making the circular cut in the ice. However, they have put down that the correct answer is three. I assume that they counted every time Mrs. Baker started cutting a hole as her actually having dug it. However, I personally disagree with this, and my reasoning is stated above.</p>\n\n<p>Can you please tell me whether my reasoning is correct?</p>\n\n<p>And if it isn't, can you please explain to me why it isn't?</p>\n\n<p>I also believe that the correct answer will also heavily depend upon the precise definition of the word <em>dig</em>.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I work for a consulting firm made up of employees that generally work in one of two types of roles. Some employees visit the client and do the work that makes us profitable, while other employees work at the firm's headquarters and ensure that those first employees have jobs lined up, that they're happy and fulfilled, that they're paid on time, that their computers work, etc. etc.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone in the first role is known as a \"consultant.\" For the latter role, the internal/administrative folks, we're struggling to come up with a term that makes sense. This issue matters more and more as my firm places a greater emphasis on security and therefore needs consistent terms for groups and access levels and related communication/documentation.</p>\n\n<p>We used to label the latter role as \"headquarters workers\" (note, not real name), but our headquarters has space for consultants to work too, so \"headquarters worker\" has gotten confusing for those with a mostly-permanent residence here. Similarly, we're very open to telecommuting, so many \"headquarters workers\" may very rarely actually work at the headquarters.</p>\n\n<p>Final twist: no one at the company likes calling the administrative workers \"corporate workers.\" They certainly <em>are</em> corporate, but the word is generally despised.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions?</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Example phrase:</em></strong> <em>At my firm, employees are either consultants or _________s; the consultants do the actual consulting, and the _________s support them.</em> </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Bonus phrase:</em></strong> <em>For the Quarterly Review communication, let's open up access to _________s for now, then add consultants when we're ready to publish.</em></p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>A traditional word for those who salvage on the sea is \"<strong>wrecker</strong>\". It's evocative of a time when salvaging wasn't considered a very nice thing to do. <a href=\"http://www.cnrs-scrn.org/northern_mariner/vol17/tnm_17_2_1-22.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Example PDF</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>On land:</p>\n\n<p>The used equipment business I've been involved in requires that we go to auctions and buy equipment at the cheapest possible prices. One of the groups of people you meet at these auctions are called \"<strong>scrappers</strong>\". They purchase metal items (and plastic and perhaps others) at auctions for their scrap value. Some of them own their own scrap yards but we might buy something that we know we can scrap.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, scrappers sometimes are on the wrong side of the law in that if you leave a thing around long enough, which has enough scrap value, and the thing is in a region which is sufficiently unobserved, then eventually a scrapper will come along, take it up, and sell it to a scrap yard. I've spent time at night watching for these folks and have surprised them a few times. <strong>In this sense, \"scrapper\" means \"scrap metal thieves\".</strong></p>\n\n<p>A typical object for scrappers is manhole covers. \"A scrapper might get about $20 covers and grates, but it can cost the city more than $200 to replace a single manhole cover. A few years ago, scrappers got only $35 a ton compared to the current $425 price for a ton.\" \u2013<a href=\"http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2008/07/commodity-boom-hits-market-for-manhole.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">mjperry.blogspot.com</a></p>\n",

Regarding OP's specific intended usage, I think it's of no consequence (not to mention off-topic) what the variable is called in his code. But whilst I don't think many people capable of having and reading a bank statement would fail to understand the word, I would not write it on a statement. Because it's clunky phrasing, not a \"rare word\".</p>\n\n<p>If I were designing a statement that needed to show last and penultimate payment dates (which seems an odd requirement to me), I would simply write the legend \"<strong>Last two payment dates</strong>\" and trust the customer to figure out which was <em>the</em> last, and which came before that.</p>\n",

It is a bit of an upscale, literary word though.

            " <p><em>Penultimate</em> is a regular word in the normal register in Portuguese or Spanish: <em>pen\u00faltimo</em>.   In English, however, it becomes a much more  educated word belonging to a much more learn\u00e8d, or elevated, register. Therefore to translate to English <strong>and keep to the same register</strong>, you must select the more pedestrian <em>next-to-last</em>.  (Then again, if we were linguists talking about syllable stress, we would not be afraid to use this word.  It just isn\u2019t a blue-collar world; it\u2019s a professional one.)</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s like asking whether you can translate PT/ES <em>cotidiano</em> to EN <em>quotidian</em>.  Yes, you <strong><em>can</em></strong>, but you shouldn\u2019t, because you\u2019ve crossed register boundaries, which means it doesn\u2019t sound equivalent even thought it means the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>Not always, but in general, when you find a word in English that\u2019s a close cognate with something from Romance, the register has switched, and you should look for a more Anglo-Saxon word if you want to keep to the same style.  Because of the Norman occupation, Modern English often has pairs of words <em>in different and contrasting registers</em>, where a more purely Romance or purely Germanic language than English now is would have only one. </p>\n\n<p>This gives English more flexibility and nuance by having recourse to a pair of terms instead of having one alone. But it is a perilous thing for non-native speakers, who must keep an eye out for a probably shift in register.  Does that make sense?</p>\n",
            " <p>I don't use the word, because it is very commonly mis-understood and mis-used. \nPeople who aren't familiar with the word assume it is an emphasizer of ULTIMATE (even-more-ultimate??), so they say things like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The magnificent costumes in \"Barry Lyndon\" are widely recognized in\n  the field of costume design as the penultimate achievement in the\n  state of the art and craft.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(From the <a href=\"http://www.costumedesignersguild.com/aw-archive/aw-recipient.asp?AwardID=10&amp;awardtype=4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Costume Designer's Guild</a>)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=penultimate%20achievement\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lots of other ludicrous examples abound</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I would use \"next to last\", especially in casual speech.</p>\n"

            " <p>The closest that I can think of is <strong><em>virtue</em></strong>.  The Roman Catholic Church contrasts the Seven Deadly Sins with the Seven Cardinal Virtues.  However, the word is not normally used by itself to describe a particular act, only a trait (or set of traits: patience, prudence, courage, etc.). It is commonly used in the adjectival form \"virtuous\", so you could say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have committed a sin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have performed a virtuous act.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
            " <p>I've seen <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mitzva\"><em>mitzva</em></a> used.</p>\n",
            " <p>English does not have a precise word for the opposite of <em>sin</em> in the sense you mean, so you'll have to be content with adjectives: the opposite of \"I committed a sin\" would be \"I performed a good/virtuous/righteous/moral/meritorious &nbsp;act/deed\". (Note that the noun forms of these adjectives won't work: <em>goodness</em> has a very wide range of meanings; <em>virtue</em> refers to qualities inhering in a person and carries no connotation of action unlike <em>virtuous act</em> which does, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>As you're writing for an Indian audience, the word you have in mind that's already familiar to your audience (<em>pun&#803;ya</em>) is a perfectly good choice to use. The criterion should not be whether a certain word exists in an English dictionary or not, but whether your audience will understand the word or not.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Further thoughts: English doesn't have have a word for the opposite of <em>sin</em>, because sin is a religious concept, and mainstream Christianity doesn't have a concept that's the opposite of sin; neither have English speakers found it necessary (<a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2009/08/14/we-are-all-hindus-now.html\">yet?</a> :p) to invent a word for the concept. In a non-religious framework for ethics, of course, there is no such thing as sin either; though certain acts may still be called <em>unethical</em> or <em>wrong</em> or by other terms.</p>\n\n<p>I'm no expert on Christian theology, but it seems that according to that framework, one is born in a state of some sin, and although one can commit further sins (acts against God's commandments), one cannot automatically reduce the effect of those sins simply by performing other good acts. Judaism has a concept of <em>mitzvah</em>, an act that carries out a commandment of God, which may be an opposite of <em>sin</em> in that sense. The concept you may be getting at, prominent in Indian religions (Hindu/Buddhist/Jain/Sikh) comes from a different model, in which there's something like a moral bank balance (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma\"><em>karma</em></a>) in which you can either lose credit through sin (<em>p\u0101pa</em>, acts against some cosmic order of right and wrong) or gain credit/merit through good deeds (<em>pun&#803;ya</em>).</p>\n\n<p>All that is not important, but if by the opposite of <em>sin</em> you're referring to something like the latter concept as informally understood by your audience\u2014with a slight theological connotation as something that brings merit to the doer\u2014then the term <em>pun&#803;ya</em> you were thinking of is precisely the right term to use. Using a generic phrase like \"good deed\" may not convey the intended meaning unless the context is understood (such as in translations etc., where \"good deed\" and \"meritorious act\" are indeed used).</p>\n",
            " <p>The antonym of <strong>sin</strong> is <strong>good deed</strong>. Sin means an action that is against religious rules, so the antonym should be in accordance with religion. </p>\n\n<p>According to many dictionaries <strong>virtue</strong> is the antonym of <strong>vice</strong>. Because it's referring to something moral rather being religious.</p>\n",
            " <p>There is a bit of a theological question here. In my religious tradition, sin is something we do (or fail to do) that brings us guilt before God, but there is nothing we can do that can remove that guilt or restore that relationship. That's why Christ came and died for our sins\u2014to remove that guilt which we could not by our own good works, and to turn away God's wrath. </p>\n",
            " <p>I believe that the word 'sin' has links to archery in the sense of missing the bulls-eye. So, in that sense, hitting the bulls-eye might be the opposite term. Just not sure if the meaning comes across as you intend :-)</p>\n",
            " <p><em>Sin</em> is so completely tied into religious terms and meanings that finding a direct opposite begins to imply much about how you are using the word. Opposites of <em>sin</em> do very much exist but most of them require a specific form of the word:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is a sinful act / This is a holy act</p>\n<p>I am full of sin / I am full of righteousness</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the most direct opposite comes from the old term <em>indulgences</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Catholic theology, an indulgence is the full or partial remission of temporal punishment due for sins which have already been forgiven. (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgences\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Actually <em>using</em> the word in a sentence is a bit of a pain and really won't satisfy a daily opposite of <em>sin</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I committed a sin / I was granted an indulgence</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Part of the problem comes from the source of the act being performed: <em>Humans</em> perform sins; <em>God</em> or the <em>church</em> performs indulgences.</p>\n<p>The next best term would be <em>repentance</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I committed a sin / I performed a repentance</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Likewise with <em>penance</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I committed a sin / I performed penance</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Absolution, protection or recovery from sin is also implied in the religious terms <em>sanctification</em>, <em>justification</em>, <em>baptism</em>, <em>confession</em>, <em>forgiveness</em>, <em>holiness</em>, <em>righteousness</em>. These terms hold their own chapters in Christian theology and to even summarize them here would be futile.</p>\n<p>All of these, however, come at this term from the religious angle. If you simply want an antonym for &quot;bad deed&quot; you will find a similar difficultly in looking for an antonym for &quot;crime.&quot; Any number of phrases will work but a specific word for the opposite of a crime will be hard to find because the concept of a crime doesn't really have an opposite.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I committed a legal act</p>\n<p>I committed a good act</p>\n<p>I committed a virtuous act</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The best I can think of is referring to a character trait as the action itself:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I performed a kindness</p>\n<p>I performed an altruism</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These have mixed success.</p>\n",
            " <p>I agree with Paul though I\u2019d render the word as \u2018perfection\u2019 (bull\u2019s-eye being simply one type of perfection). Sinning in many religious traditions is simply not living up the standard, not getting it right, or falling short.</p>\n",
            " <p>The English word \"sin\" is very much tied up in Christian ideology. In traditional Christian belief human beings are inherently sinful, and can't help but sin continually. As such, there really isn't much need for an opposite because the opposite condition does not (in fact, <em>can not</em>) exist.</p>\n",
            " <p>Sin is primarily a religious concept, which takes various forms. As noted above, certain religious traditions have an antonymous concept (such as mitzvah in judaism), but there is no generally accepted term, because there is no generally accepted concept.</p>\n\n<p>In the judaeo-christian context, perhaps the best approach is to translate mitzvah into English; I understand that the closest translation is \"duty\".</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, this is the wrong question to ask, because English is used by many, many sub-cultures which all have very, very different ideas about this area.</p>\n",
            " <p>In Islam, there is the concept of a \"sin\" and a \"charity.\" At the end of days, your sins and charities are tallied and the math worked out. Generally speaking, a charity is any good dead or deed that brings happiness. Interesting, pleasuring your wife is considered a charity.</p>\n",
            " <p>If we're using the Biblical definition of sin, then sin is transgression of God's law. Many versions translate the Greek as \"Lawlessness\".</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_john/3-4.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bible.cc/1_john/3-4.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the opposite would be \"lawful\".</p>\n\n<p>Interpreted another way, sin can also be said to be disobedience to God's law, so \"Obedience\" is another possible antonym for sin.</p>\n",
            " <p>In religious contexts that I'm aware of you can't \"pay forward\" on sins.  Therefore, any opposite for \"sin\" would have to be considered as a repeal or undoing of that sin.</p>\n\n<p>For \"sin\" used as a <em>noun</em>, some suitable antonyms would be \"<strong><em>atonement</em></strong>\" or \"<strong><em>expiation</em></strong>.\"  The drawbacks of these two terms is that they are often interpreted as acts of personal suffering rather than acts of morally good deeds.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>First I committed a <em>sin</em>,</li>\n<li>Then I made an <em>atonement</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For the <em>verb</em> \"sin\", the verb forms of the aforementioned terms, \"<strong><em>atone</em></strong>\" and \"<strong><em>expiate</em></strong>,\" should be equally suitable.  Another verb that can be used as the undoing of sin is \"<strong><em>redeem</em></strong>,\" as in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"...and don't come back until you've <em>redeemed</em> yourself!\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of course, all of these terms can be used outside of the context of <em>religious sin</em>, so how much \"oppositeness\" they have with \"sin\" would depend on the context in which they're used.</p>\n",
            " <p>Although it comes from a different tradition, I would say \"Dharma\"</p>\n",
            " <p>Abide, I say this because you are following a rule. If there were no rule, then you could not sin. </p>\n\n<p>To abide, comply, follow.</p>\n\n<p>There is no direct antonym e.g. unsin etc. </p>\n",
            " <p>This comes up in Bible translation. \"Righteousness\" is the correct antonym in many contexts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"It is considered a sin\"</li>\n<li>\"It is considered a righteousness\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is a close parallel to the Hebrew \"tzedek\" or \"tzdaka\", with the same root.</p>\n",
            " <p>Sin can be both a verb and a noun. The opposite of the verb sin is <strong>Repent</strong> or <strong>atoned</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>eg.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>First I sinned, then I <strong>repented</strong> so now God loves me - yea!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The opposite of the noun form can be any of the following: good deed, help, redeemed, basically anything that means you did a good thing.</p>\n\n<p>eg.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I made up for that sin by <strong>doing a good deed</strong>, now God owes me one, right?</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
            " <p>My action was without error. </p>\n\n<p>I erred not.</p>\n\n<p>I acted faultlessly.</p>\n\n<p>...and so on, error (okay, existential error) being the essential substance of sin.</p>\n",
            " <p>If you have sinned, then you have done something wrong.  If you have done nothing wrong then you have <strong>behaved</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>conduct oneself in accordance with the accepted norms of a society or\n  group.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you want a Christian twist then I would add <strong>moral</strong>.</p>\n",
            " <p>The Hebrew word <em>mitzvah</em>, which combines \"commandment\" and \"good deed\", is the opposite of sin in that language. There isn't a single word in English with the same nuance.</p>\n",
            " <p>It depends what you mean by <em>sin</em>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are using <em>sin</em> to mean disobedience to one of the Ten Commandments or to 'God's laws', then the opposite must be <strong>obedience to</strong> or <strong>obeying</strong> the Commandments.</p>\n\n<p>If you are using <em>sin</em> to mean 'doing wrong' in general, then it depends how you perceive 'right and wrong'. If you perceive them as 'black and white', i.e. one or the other, then the opposite must be <strong>right</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>But if you perceive 'right and wrong' as two extremes with a whole area in the middle that is neither right nor wrong, then there can be <strong>no exact opposite</strong>. For example, it might be considered wrong (sinful) to hate your neighbour, and right to love you neighbour. But you might actually be indifferent to your neighbour, neither loving nor hating him. In that case, are you sinning; are you doing right or wrong: or are you in the middle?</p>\n",
            " <p>I feel the opposite of Sin is \" Heavenly deed\".  Sinners go to hell and people who does good deeds and obtain \" Punya\" ( Indian opposite word for Sin) will go to Heaven. Good and Ban are are set by each society differently. Some societies view Homosexuality is sin and some view it opposite. How can one define, good or bad, but what ever society or parts of the Country set is decisive factor. Some tribal areas Smoking etc, is natural and legal for them, but not in certain areas. One can not set the exact meanings for Beauty, wind or smell, as how one perceives. Good virtues or deeds is how the particular place or part of the World set the rules and view. Even the above words  Heaven or Hell are also if  one believes</p>\n",
            " <p>The opposite of sin, or to be free from sin, or wrong, is to be blameless, or without sin: </p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://en.academic.ru/dic.nsf/cide/87609/Impeccant\" rel=\"nofollow\">Impeccant</a></strong> a. Sinless; impeccable. --Byron. [1913 Webster]  </p>\n\n<p>Notably, sin is a religious and not a secular, and the concept is based on being in full communion with God.  The action of doing good deeds does not make one without sin, not addresses the communion itself.  Perhaps this contradiction is best understood in the example of a mobster who kills without impunity but yet is adored for their generosity within their community</p>\n"

        "sft_target": " <p>English does not have a precise word for the opposite of <em>sin</em> in the sense you mean, so you'll have to be content with adjectives: the opposite of \"I committed a sin\" would be \"I performed a good/virtuous/righteous/moral/meritorious &nbsp;act/deed\". (Note that the noun forms of these adjectives won't work: <em>goodness</em> has a very wide range of meanings; <em>virtue</em> refers to qualities inhering in a person and carries no connotation of action unlike <em>virtuous act</em> which does, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>As you're writing for an Indian audience, the word you have in mind that's already familiar to your audience (<em>pun&#803;ya</em>) is a perfectly good choice to use. The criterion should not be whether a certain word exists in an English dictionary or not, but whether your audience will understand the word or not.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Further thoughts: English doesn't have have a word for the opposite of <em>sin</em>, because sin is a religious concept, and mainstream Christianity doesn't have a concept that's the opposite of sin; neither have English speakers found it necessary (<a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2009/08/14/we-are-all-hindus-now.html\">yet?</a> :p) to invent a word for the concept. In a non-religious framework for ethics, of course, there is no such thing as sin either; though certain acts may still be called <em>unethical</em> or <em>wrong</em> or by other terms.</p>\n\n<p>I'm no expert on Christian theology, but it seems that according to that framework, one is born in a state of some sin, and although one can commit further sins (acts against God's commandments), one cannot automatically reduce the effect of those sins simply by performing other good acts. Judaism has a concept of <em>mitzvah</em>, an act that carries out a commandment of God, which may be an opposite of <em>sin</em> in that sense. The concept you may be getting at, prominent in Indian religions (Hindu/Buddhist/Jain/Sikh) comes from a different model, in which there's something like a moral bank balance (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma\"><em>karma</em></a>) in which you can either lose credit through sin (<em>p\u0101pa</em>, acts against some cosmic order of right and wrong) or gain credit/merit through good deeds (<em>pun&#803;ya</em>).</p>\n\n<p>All that is not important, but if by the opposite of <em>sin</em> you're referring to something like the latter concept as informally understood by your audience\u2014with a slight theological connotation as something that brings merit to the doer\u2014then the term <em>pun&#803;ya</em> you were thinking of is precisely the right term to use. Using a generic phrase like \"good deed\" may not convey the intended meaning unless the context is understood (such as in translations etc., where \"good deed\" and \"meritorious act\" are indeed used).</p>\n",

Approach indirectly, in a roundabout way, or too cautiously. For example, <em>Stop beating around the bush\u2014get to the point</em>. This term, first recorded in 1572, originally may have alluded to beating the bushes for game.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In contrast to Ammer, John Ayto, <em>Oxford Dictionary of Idioms</em>, third edition (2009), has no doubt that &quot;beat about the bush&quot; comes from hunting:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>beat about the bush</strong> discuss a matter without coming to the point; be ineffectual and waste time.</p>\n<p>This phrase is a metaphor which originated in the shooting or netting of birds; compare with <strong>beat the bushes</strong> below.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p><strong>beat the bushes</strong> search thoroughly <em>North American informal</em></p>\n<p>This expression originates from the way in which hunters walk through undergrowth wielding long sticks which are used to force birds or animals out into the open where they can be shot or netted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we have an odd situation where the same practical hunting activity has been adopted idiomatically to mean &quot;to take extensive direct action in pursuit of something&quot; and &quot;to take indirect measures to suggest or imply something.&quot;</p>\n<p>The <em>Cambridge International Book of Idioms</em> (1998) agrees with Ayto as to where &quot;beat the bushes&quot; arose:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>beat the bushes</strong> <em>American</em> to try very hard to get or achieve something [Example:] <em>She's not out there beating the bushes for a job \u2014 she's just as happy not working.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The North American origin of &quot;beat the bushes,&quot; which Oxford and Cambridge agree on, doesn't jibe with the 1400s first occurrence date that Ammer claims in <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms</em>. However, in Christine Ammer, <em>The Facts on File Dictionary of Clich\u00e9s</em>, second edition (2006), Ammer hedges a bit on the 1400s provenance of &quot;beat the bushes,&quot; saying that the phrase &quot;has been used in its literal sense since the fifteenth century.&quot; That is a far cry, of course, from identifying when it began to be used idiomatically in the sense of &quot;to seek out assiduously.&quot;</p>\n<p>In her <em>Dictionary of Clich\u00e9s</em>, Ammer also provides more detail about the earliest occurrence of &quot;beat about the bush&quot;:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>beat around/about the bush, to</strong> Indirection in word or deed; to shillyshally, to approach something in a roundabout way. This expression for overcautiousness dates from the early sixteenth century, when Robert Whytynton (<em>Vulgaria</em>, 1520) warned, &quot;a long betynge about the busshe and losse of time.&quot; Some authorities think it came from beating the bushes for game, and indeed there are numerous sayings concerning the delays caused by too much beating and not enough bird catching, dating back even further.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A fuller presentation of the statement by Whytynton (or Whittinton), as cited in Jane Griffiths, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=QxdoGDy9GdQC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=%22betynge+about+the%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=An2xVKOWConvoATas4LICg&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22betynge%20about%20the%22&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>John Skelton and Poetic Authority</em></a> (2006) shows that even at that date the phrase is already being used metaphorically or idiomatically:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imitacyon of autours without preceptes &amp; rules/is but a longe betynge about the busshe &amp; losse of tyme to a yonge beginner</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But Robert Hendrickson, <em>The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins</em> (1997) cites a rather more complicated origin of the term:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>beat around the bush.</strong> ... Hunters once hired beaters who &quot;started&quot; birds and other game for them by beating the bush and scaring them out into the open. The simplest explanation for the phrase <em>to beat around the bush</em>, to approach a matter very carefully or in a roundabout way, is that these beaters had to take great care when approaching the bush or they would &quot;start&quot; the game too soon for the hunter to get a good shot. But etymologist Ernest Weekley and others believe that the expression, which dates back to at least the early sixteenth century, is a mixed metaphor. Weekley suggests that the old proverb &quot;I will not beat the bush that another may have the bird&quot; joined with &quot;to around the bush,&quot; an early expression used for a hound hesitating when circling the bush \u2014 and gave us <em>beat around the bush</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Anne Baker, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=6t0LAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22beat+about+the+bush%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7MmxVPTwDITVoASh6IDoBQ&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCDge#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beat%20about%20the%20bush%22&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Glossary of Northamptonshire Words and Phrases</em></a> (1854) offers this interesting local sense of the phrase:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>BEAT. &quot;Beat about the bush;&quot; to reconnoitre; to endeavour to obtain information; or attain an object by circuitous means.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Instances of 'beating the bushes' in the wild</strong></em></p>\n<p>Given the early instances of &quot;beating the bushes&quot; and &quot;beating around the bushes&quot; cited by the dictionaries discussed above, one of the most surprising things about a Google Books search for the phrases is how late the earliest matches for each phrase are. Normally when an idiom is in use from the 1500s forward, the Google Books database will include a smattering of instances from the 1600s and many more from the early 1700s. But here, a search for &quot;beat the bushes&quot; turns up only a handful unique and confirmable matches before 1800. The first of these is from Gervase Markham, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=vm81AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR20&amp;dq=%22beat+the+bushes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=M7qxVMToDNO7ogTAy4GADA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beat%20the%20bushes%22&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Hunger's Prevention</em></a> (1621), cited in the introduction to an 1876 edition of <em>The Tempest</em>, apropos of a description of bat fowling (hunting for roosting birds at night):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thus being prepared [&quot;with long poales, very rough and bushy at the vpper ends&quot;] and comming into the Bushy, or rough ground where the haunts of Birds are, you shall then first kindle some of your fiers as halfe, or a third part, according as your provision is, and then with your other bushy and rough poales you shall <strong>beat the Bushes</strong>, Trees, and haunts of the Birds to enforce them to rise, which done you shall see the Birds which are raysed, to flye and play about the lights and flames of the fier, for it is their nature through their amazednesse, and affright at the strangenes of the light and the extreme darknesse round about it, not to depart from it, but as it were almost to scorch their wings in the same; so that those who have the rough bushye poales, may (at their pleasures) beat them down with the same, &amp; so take them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, from James Harrington, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=jl9NGI6MK0oC&amp;q=%22beat+the+bushes%22&amp;dq=%22beat+the+bushes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=boCxVOimIsbwoATMxoEI&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>The Commonwealth of Oceana</em></a> (1656):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is noted out of CICERO by Macchiavel, That the People, tho they are not so prone to find out Truth of themselves, as to follow Custom, or run into Error ; yet if they be shewn Truth, they not only acknowledge and imbrace it very suddenly, but are the most constant and faithful  Guardians and Conservators of it. It is your Duty and Office, wherto you are also qualify'd by the Orders of this Commonwealth, to have the People as you have your Hauks and Greyhounds, in Leases and Slips, to range the Fields, and <strong>beat the Bushes</strong> for them ; for they are of a nature that is never good at this spart, but when you spring or start their proper quarry.

But the Fielding and Hoadley examples involve human beaters.</p>\n<p>The earliest nonliteral use of &quot;beat the bushes&quot; (after Harrington's from 1656) in the Google Books search results occurs in the late 1800s.

That meaning pops up (metaphorically) in James St. John, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=MubOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=%22beat+about+the+bush%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tdGxVLvfA46qogSl8ILABQ&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwATiMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beat%20about%20the%20bush%22&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>The History of the Manners and Customs of Ancient Greece</em></a>, volume 2 (1842):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A crown, an extra junket, and the applause of the company, cheered the successful \u0152dipos [in riddle-solving contests], while the lackwit who <strong>beat about the bush</strong> without catching the owl, had to make wry faces over a cup of brine or pickle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the generalized idiom returns, very modern in tone, in Charles Dickens, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=U9UWAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=%22beat+about+the+bush%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hdOxVJH0D4nwoASd6ICQBA&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAjigAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beat%20about%20the%20bush%22&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>The Old Curiosity Shop</em></a>, in <em>Master Humphrey's Clock</em> (1841):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The girl [little Nell] has strong affections, and, brought up as she has been, may at her age be easily influenced and persuaded.

The last piece of advice is to not go crazy and blow all your heals when you take damage.

It removes you from the area for a few seconds and has saved my life at least once when both heals and my health potion were on cooldown</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/class/monk/passive/transcendence\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Transcendence</a> - This passive makes it so you almost always full-heal with any of the 3 skills listed above</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The important bit was to save your spirit for heals, and just auto-attack for damage and spirit generation.</p>\n\n<p>And a side note, be sure your best quality health potion is equipped in your Q slot. I didn't notice at first that it doesn't automatically use the best health potion when you hit Q, and you have to actually change which health potion to use by dragging the one you want onto your skill bar.</p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I have a question of conservation of energy. Let's say I have two charged plates, one positively charged and the other negatively charged. Both have a hole and an electric field exists between the two plates. Now, let's consider an infinitely far away positively charged particule. Its potential energy is zero, same for its kinetic energy, thus its mechanical energy is also zero. My question is as follows. If the particule gets between the plates by the positive side, it now has potential energy, thus its mechanical energy increased. Where did that energy come from? Even worse, when the particule gets out by the other hole, it has kinetic energy, thus free work has been done by the plates. This is impossible and it seems to violate energy conservation. I'm not in the field of physics, just an engineering student but this is question has bothered me for some time. For example, I don't get why ion engines consume energy since it seems that accelerating particules with an electric field is free. One possibility would be that we need to expand energy to get the particules between the plates since their mechanical energy increases but I don't know where that would come from. What's the catch?</p>\n<p>Edit: When I'm saying two plates with a hole I mean something like that:\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/amBLb.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/amBLb.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>And the electric field between two finite charged plates is:\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/adovB.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/adovB.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

Essentially, under relativity, everything can be said to move at c, some part of it is motion through space, some of it through time, and when we speed up or slow down we are merely exchanging one motion for another. However, I never understood what is meant by \"speed\" or \"motion\" here. </p>\n\n<p>Specifically what confuses me is the idea of \"motion through time\". \"Speed\" to me normally means the rate in which an object varies in space over time, and to talk about something \"moving\" we talk about it changing it's position with respect to time. But what does it mean when we say that an object \"moves\" through time (or space-time) or has a \"speed\"? Speed with respect to what? And what would it mean for something to move through spacetime at a different rate?</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the only way I can make sense of the idea of a speed through spacetime is by introducing some sort of meta-time or hypertime, with which we can talk about movement through space-time, but that sounds a bit extreme. Can someone help explain it for me? Hope this all sounds clear enough for you guys. Thank you in advance.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p><strong><em>The FABRIC OF SPACETIME</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>What does the question and the concept mean?</p>\n\n<p>It's not a scientific question, there is no such term as <em>fabric</em> in physics. Rather, it is a generic conceptual question meaning a few things:</p>\n\n<p>1) <strong><em>QUANTUM GRAVITY: What is its microscopic structure?</em></strong>: what is spacetime made of? What is it's fine structure, as if you looked from close up, as a surface, a fabric? What is it that is interwoven that makes it be what it is? </p>\n\n<p>2) <strong><em>GRAVITATION: What of it's dynamics?:</em></strong> How does it behave and why? What are its mysteries and strange ways by which we see objects moving and changing?</p>\n\n<p>2) <strong><em>COSMOLOGY: What is it's large-scale structure?:</em></strong> How does it look in the large, from a distance? What makes it be anything more than an empty canvas on which matter and energy travel and interact? </p>\n\n<p>The term fabric tends to be inspired by the first question -- what does it look like when you look close up?. But if you pull away from looking at the fine fabric, you see the astrophysical regime of stars, galaxies and clusters, and as you see from further away you see the universe in its larger scales. You may also wonder if there are more universes. All of these have to play into each other, so they need to be related. At this point in our understanding of the physics of spacetime, we know better how to try to answer questions 2 and 3. Those can be for the most part (but not fully) explained by General Relativity (GR) which explains Gravitation, and the more or less known physics of classical mechanics, electromagnetism and thermodynamics, along with the modern physics of quantum mechanics (QM), quantum field theory (QFT), and the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, which together explain atoms, electrons, protons, neutrons, photons and other elementary particles.</p>\n\n<p>The first question, about spacetime in the small is harder, we have no real data about gravity at distances smaller than maybe about 1/10 of a mm, where Newtonian gravitation still seems to hold. And have not been able to explore the even smaller distances that require energies much larger (some think maybe not that much more, if there are extra dimensions of certain sizes) than what we can produce in the LHC, our most powerful particle accelerator.     </p>\n\n<p>So, really, it's a big question. The easiest way to get a grip is to first simply bring in what we do know. That's part of the answer to questions 2 and 3. It gets more speculative, and strange, for question 1. </p>\n\n<p>A good reference for spacetime is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in the wiki link here</a></p>\n\n<p>As Heather described in her answer, spacetime is like that 2 dimensional fabric we see bent or deformed in many popular descriptions, like the figure below, except it is 4 dimensional -- well, she makes clear that's very different. That's why she says to try to wipe that figure from your mind, it's the 4 dimensions that makes it real and true. The sheet doesn't bend down below the earth in reality -- the earth resides in that 4 dimensional spacetime, and actually moves through it, both in the space dimensions, and evolves to the future as time goes on. In 4D we see its time history of it, its so called worldline. We can't draw on 4D, but in we can ignore one of the spatial dimensions, and draw a spacetime diagram in 3D, as the next figure shows.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2fthm.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2fthm.png\" alt=\"2D conception of spacetime curvature\"></a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GmLd2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GmLd2.png\" alt=\"A spacetime diagram with 1 spatial dimension not included. WE see x and y in the plane, and time going up. the cones are where the worldliness of light rays lie\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The earth does in fact deform the 4 dimensional spacetime. The next figure helps a little visualize the paths of light rays and see their deflection due to gravitation.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pYYeY.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pYYeY.gif\" alt=\"This depicts the spacetime curvature, still in 2D, and shows a useful visualization of the path of a ray of light from a distant star, and why it looks like that ray&#39;s path was bent -- we call it deflected by gravitation\"></a> </p>\n\n<p>But as Heather said, it is really 4D, and it's hard to visualize. And as Countto10 says, it can be pretty complicated. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>So WHAT IS GRAVITATION, as described by GENERAL RELATIVITY?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>It's the 4D spacetime, along with equations that relate the geometry of spacetime to the distribution of matter-energy in that spacetime. It's an equation like,</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9MjYs.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9MjYs.png\" alt=\"the left hand side is the effect on geometry, the right hand side is the matter-energy content\"></a></p>\n\n<p>that determines (partially, some initial or boundary conditions or symmetries which define the context are needed to get a unique solution) the geometry of spacetime. From it one can solve for the metric, $g_{\\mu\\nu}$, which completely defines the geometry (the R terms on the left hand side are functions of the metric and its derivatives up to second order). For this one obtains all the solutions like Black Holes, gravitational waves, and the orbits of the planets and stars.  </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>But, WHAT OF THE MORE EXCITING AND OUTLANDISH PICTURES LIKE THE UNIVERSE EXPANDING AND WORMHOLES CONNECTING DIFFERENT PARTS OF SPACETIME?</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p>Well, yes, for that we have to do more work. WE have to solve the equations that describe the evolution of the universe (with the help also of the equations for the matter-energy on the right hand side). And it is done, and results in the Lambda-CDM concordance model, with the universe expanding and as we now know accelerating, and the Cosmic Microwave Background coming from when radiation was let loose 380,000 years after the Big Bang. See for that the chronology of the universe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_universe\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">at the wiki article here</a></p>\n\n<p>As for wormholes, they are hypothetical structures of spacetime that would connect one region of spacetime with another very far away. They've not been seen, are theoretically unlikely but possible if we had exotic material (negative mass , other possibilities), also not seen. See wormhole in the wiki article at <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole</a> </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>And WHAT OF THE QUANTUM PICTURE OF THE FABRIC IN THE SMALL, THE MICROSCOPIC VIEW?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, it's more speculative since we still don't have an accepted theory of gravity at very small distances and very high energies. Two most cited theories are string theory and quantum loop theory. In one way or another it leads to a highly dynamic high energy submicroscopic spacetime, bubbling and changing, and somehow causing what we see as spacetime now to emerge. See <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lD8Sk.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lD8Sk.png\" alt=\"one spacetime foam concept here\"></a>. </p>\n\n<p>Another factor that comes in and is still possibly in play is multiple dimensions, with perhaps 6 really compacted dimensions at every 4D spacetime point, such as the Calibi Yau manifold <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HNvwF.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HNvwF.png\" alt=\"Calibi Yau manifold\"></a>. </p>\n\n<p>There's other variations with large higher dimensional spacetime membranes. See String Cosmology <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_cosmology\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>WHAT'S THE FABRIC OF SPACETIME?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>It's some unknown combination of those and a few others.

            " <p>To better picture general relativity you need to first discard the common concept called \"the force\" of gravity. GR is not based on an attractive force between Earth and Sun.</p>\n\n<p>Now if you want to explain why we are orbiting around Sun you bring the theory of general relativity. It says that spacetime is curved around Sun. So there is no other way around for Earth to move near to Sun but to orbit even when it is free and there is no force upon it. This is because the space is curved. Also if you are much closer to Sun the orbit pattern is not fixed in time. It changes and evolves because time is also curved. And people closer to Sun do not agree with you sitting on Earth about passing of time with respect to a series of events because they have their own different clock. Yet you and they would agree if measure the same event in terms of spacetime.</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine you are far away from Sun. Spacetime is not that much curved. Earth would have moved in a straight line forever because spacetime is flat.</p>\n\n<p>Also imagine that you are interested in the movement of Earth over very short distances in spacetime even close to Sun. Again spacetime is not that much curved. You can approximate with a straight fixed line in spacetime.</p>\n\n<p>General Relativity should not be formidable to learn even with involved levels of mathematics. It is about having a single formula relating dynamics of mass-energy to geometry of spacetime. This formula remains spectacularly valid even if you play around with countless combinations or variations of spacetime coordinates. Some of the combinations of coordinates are, however, much simpler to draw and to make sense of them in four dimensions.</p>\n\n<p>When applied to the whole universe it gives you clear insights about the past, the epochs that have passed, and of course the future plausible evolutions of the universe. In particular it helps you picture if the universe will continue expanding, or contracting, or oscillating indefinitely, or there might be other universes nearby on gigantic scales of spacetime.</p>\n",
            " <p>I have always had a huge problem with people describing gravity in these terms.</p>\n\n<p>Even if it doesn't take 4D into consideration it also uses gravity to explain gravity. Bassicaly it says that bigger the mass, the bigger depth in the fabric it falls into. But for other objects to be accelerated towards those masses it requires a gravity to be pulling them downwards. So this description is one of the worst  I've ever seen.</p>\n\n<p>Never explain a thing with using a thing you're explaining. It's like saying a car is red because a collor red looks red.</p>\n",
            " <p>The spacetime of general relativity is highly dynamic. Static representations are very misleading. Static representations include the rubber sheet metaphor, which is static because the rubber sheet is just <em>there</em>, implying an all-encompassing Euclidian background that does not exist; they also include the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternalism_(philosophy_of_time)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">block universe</a> where the whole of spacetime is seen somewhat from outside, which is impossible since Einstein's equations are only local.</p>\n\n<p>We can only experience spacetime from inside, and only locally. Thus, there is no really any fabric in the sense of something that all observer would agree is objectively present everywhere. What we have are relations: how what an observer measures can compare to what another observer measures, knowing how the two observers move relatively one to the other. What these relations show is that there is no Newtonian space acting as an empty container for things to live in, and that there is no global notion of simultaneity either, so there is not an universal time valid for all observers. </p>\n\n<p>It can even be said that in the absence of matter, spacetime is not even defined: this is (vastly simplified) the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_argument\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hole argument</a>; there is no container where there is no contents! See also <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach&#39;s_principle\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mach's principle</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If we dig further, we can see that what spacetime gives us is only a set of symmetries, allowing us to \"transport\" physical laws from a frame of reference to another. And strikingly, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics_and_representation_theory\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wigner's classification of fundamental particles</a> links them to the Poincar\u00e9 group of the symmetries of spacetime, so this is another venue, after the hole argument, pointing out that in a certain sense the contents of spacetime (in that case, particles) <em>is</em> spacetime.</p>\n\n<p>So, maybe <em>we</em> are the fabric of spacetime.</p>\n"

So that's not going to get you very far, as you are going to ask what's \"outside\" this shape.</p>\n\n<p>My suggestion to you is to think of space as a distance based idea, but only for short distances, relatively short that is, from Earth to Betelgeuse the space as distance idea will be fine. </p>\n\n<p>On a universal scale, you might consider spacetime not as a \"thing/fabric\", but as a way of describing how the objects in the universe relate to each, both in space and time. This idea is very abstract I  admit, but tell me any part of modern physics that is not? </p>\n\n<p>150 years ago, energy was not viewed in discrete terms, but now we know it is, although we don't have an idea why (at least I personally don't).</p>\n\n<p>My point is, on the small scale, we had to redefine our word energy, and on the large scale, we may need to redefine our concept of spacetime from distance terms to relationship terms. </p>\n"

The energy(in eV) required to remove both the electrons from a neutral Helium atom is:</p>\n\n<p>$a.$ 38.2</p>\n\n<p>$b.$ 49.2</p>\n\n<p>$c.$ 51.8</p>\n\n<p>$d.$ 79.0</p>\n\n<p><strong>My try:</strong> Since after removing an electron the Helium atom becomes a single electron atom, Bohr's Model can be applied. The energy of the single electron is hence given by $-13.6\\frac {z^{2}}{n^{2}}$ (where z is atomic no. and n is the no. of the shell in which the electron resides). Thus the energy comes out to be $-13.6\\frac {4}{1}$, which is $-54.4$. Thus the total energy required to remove both the electrons is $24.6+54.4=79.0eV$, which should be option $d.$.

The spacecraft will perceive its received data rate as being a bit faster than the transmitter's data rate on the satellite. A way to know this is via the fact that a clock taken from the satellite to the spacecraft, then after a while brought back to the satellite, will lose a bit of time relative to a clock left on the satellite, but uploaded data is like clock ticks on the satellite. </p>\n</blockquote>\n",
            " <p>Doppler effect (relativistic) of the Electromagnetic Waves will take place. As a result you will receive the emitted Wifi signal (EM wave) as squeezed along the time axis (increases frequency). Naturally the WiFi demodulator available with you would report invalid (unrecognised) signal because digital data is encoded on the carrier wave by some form of modulation like Frequency Shift Keying , Phase shift keying etc. </p>\n\n<p>Let's say it's transmitted by FSK. In FSK, the 0s and 1s are transmitted through distinct changes in Carrier Wave frequency held for a particular duration. First of all the EM wave frequency has changed  hence your demodulator won't even recognise the EM wave as Wifi signal. </p>\n\n<p>Assume that you have accounted for Doppler effect EM wave frequency change and distinct change in the changes of the changed frequency (obtained from it's corresponding changed Fourier transform) for zero and one encoding, into your custom demodulator. So the EM wave is now recognised as Wifi signal. But as stated above the distinct changes in EM wave frequency is held for a pre agreed time (between transmitter and receiver) to encode 0 &amp; 1. So due to time dilation this agreement breaks. So your demodulator although recognises Wifi signal presence, reports invalid protocol. </p>\n\n<p>Now you might be tempted to think let's account for the time dilation into the demodulator. But that isn't really a good idea because the above stated pre agreed duration was statistically obtained to ensure noise free transmission. So if you try to account for that in your demodulator, you will occasionally receive corrupted data due to noise in the transmission.

As a consequence, two-way Doppler shifts can be as large as \u00b1 440 Hz at 144 MHz, \u00b1 4 kHz at 1296 MHz, and \u00b1 30 kHz at 10 GHz.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, if your satellite is the size of earth, you might see a doppler shift varying between <strong>+3000 parts per billion</strong> and -3000 parts per billion over the course of an orbit.</p>\n\n<p>However, communication standards already expect a certain amount of doppler shift - according to <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QZggAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;ots=NVwnmuQhHL&amp;dq=802.11n%20doppler&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q=802.11n%20doppler&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Next Generation Wireless LANs: 802.11n and 802.11ac\"</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>in 802.11n [...] the values for Doppler spread in the 5GHz band is approximately 6Hz</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the makers of the standard already expect a doppler shift of <strong>1.2 parts per billion</strong>. Cell phone mobile data standards like 5G worry about doppler even more - allowing them to work even on high-speed trains.</p>\n\n<p>But meanwhile, according to <a href=\"http://application-notes.digchip.com/031/31-20310.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Clock Solutions for WiFi (IEEE 802.11)\"</a> (admittedly a dated source)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The typical performance requirement is \u00b125ppM all-inclusive frequency\n  stability (includes initial calibration tolerance at 25\u00b0C and\n  frequency changes over operating temperature, power and load\n  fluctuations, and aging).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So WiFi hardware makers are <em>already</em> compensating for a <strong>25,000 parts per billion crystal frequency error</strong>, which can vary with changing temperature conditions.</p>\n\n<p>I would say, as long as any motion-induced doppler frequency changes are small and slow compared to the thermally-induced crystal frequency changes wifi can already account for, you should get normal performance <em>from a frequency perspective</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, depending on your orbital radius you might encounter problems due to <strong>signal latency</strong> - and <strong>inverse-square-law signal attenuation</strong>. And the signal attenuation happens in both directions, so even if the satellite has a megawatt transmitter to give a really long range, you won't get a two-way link unless your wifi hotspot has the same great range.</p>\n"

            " <p>You're correct that in both barometers and microphones air pressure changes are converted into displacements and those displacements may be converted to electrical signals.</p>\n<p>We can think of them both as pressure sensor devices that define a function <span class=\"math-container\">$x(P(t))$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\">$P(t)$</span> is the pressure at the device input over time <span class=\"math-container\">$t$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$x$</span> is the position displacement of the sensor.</p>\n<p>From a signal processing perspective the differences are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A microphone has a much larger bandwidth. That is, high frequency (e.g. acoustic) pressure fluctuations will not turn into noticeable position fluctuations for a Barometer. Barometers work at very low frequencies (probably Hz bandwidth at best? I don't know,) while microphones work at acoustic frequencies. The comments indicate that some microphones have finite response at DC while some don't.</li>\n<li>The operating ranges are much different. Barometers will report pressures down to pretty low pressures and up to high pressures relative to atmospheric pressure. The displacement of a microphone sensor will clip very quickly if the pressure changes too much from atmospheric pressure. This is related to the the dynamic range of the sensor devices.</li>\n<li>The sensitivities are different. Microphones can detect very small pressure changes (at the appropriate frequencies) whereas barometers cannot. (similar to last point)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So yes, both barometers and microphones use displacements to measure pressures. But as sensors they have vastly different specifications. That said, since they're both pressure sensors, I'm sure technological developments in barometers have influenced microphone designs and vice-versa.</p>\n",
            " <p>There are several different technical solutions to microphones which influence what they measure. I will limit this discussion to two types: an omni pressure sensitive mic and a figure 8 velocity sensitive mic.</p>\n<p>First the figure 8 microphones which does not measure air pressure but instead air velocity: Imagine a very thin not very wide ribbon or band set in more or less free air, suspended from its both ends. (This is actually a rather good description of how a ribbon microphone is created. Typically a very thin alumnium band, say half a centimeter wide and 3 centimeters long). The band will waver to and fro depending on the <strong>velocity</strong> of air &quot;wind&quot;. We can call this that the band acts according to local air velocity. As sound is &quot;wind&quot; going to and fro here, the mic then translates this wavering motion into an electrical signal. You can understand that the air pressure, barometric pressure, is more or less same on both sides of the band. The mic will not react to high or low air pressure. This mic will be sensitive to air movement perpendicalur to the surface of the ribbon, but quite unsensitive to air movement over the thin band creating a sensitivity graph looking like the number 8, hence the name.</p>\n<p>Now for the second type of mic I talk about here: an omnidirectional pressure sensitive mic. Imagine a thin membrane tensed across a closed cavity. (Again, this is actually the design of mics and some barometers). Increasing air pressure will push the membrane in towards the cavity, decreasing air pressure will allow the membrane to move outwards. Sound is seen here as a local to and fro in the <strong>pressure</strong> of air. The mic (or barometer for that case) translates this into an electrical signal. For barometers, the cavity may be fixed reference, say a vacuum. For actual microphones though there is a small hole from outside air to the cavity. This will allow the cavity to be filled with air around with on average the same pressure as outside air. In effect the hole will work as a high-pass filter: only air pressure variations with a high enough frequency can be registered by the mic. The &quot;barometric&quot; pressure, of a very low frequency, will hence be filtered out and only the higher frequency sounds will remain. (Now, some measurement mics may go below 1Hz as lower frequency, but mics used for recording music usually starts at something like 10Hz as there is very little music in lower frequencys). The pressure measuring mic is more or less omni-directional on lower frequencys (same sensitivity in all directions) but will become more and more directional in higher frequencys (say above 1kHz) due to the exact design as the membrane does point in one direction.</p>\n<p>As a side note: most microphones used for voice or music today have a cardoid pattern. This can be though of, and sometimes created, a combination of omni + a figure 8. Exactly how to do this is left as an exercise for the reader ;-) .</p>\n",
            " <p>A barometer measures the absolute pressure. It cannot follow the pressure change arbitrarily fast. That means it has some upper cutoff frequency when regarded as a measurement device.</p>\n<p>A microphone considered as a measurement device, on the contrary, also measures pressure, but not absolute pressure. It has a lower cutoff frequency and can only detect deviations of pressure from the average pressure. If the changes are too slow it cannot detect them and is completely immune to slow changes in the base (ambient) pressure. Fast enough changes are detected though (and this is &quot;sound&quot;).</p>\n<p>Note the other answer dp/dt is not correct, as there would be a strong frequency dependence. Double frequency would generate double electrical signal. This is not the case for a microphone.\nA microphone is supposed to generate an electrical signal proportional to the acoustic level which is the pressure level.</p>\n<p>To be fair, the frequency response of a microphone is not supposed to be flat but follow some characteristic to mimic human ear. But this is not dp/dt either.</p>\n",
            " <p>There is at least one design of a microphone and a pressure sensor that really differ only in geometry:</p>\n<p>The carbon microphone:\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_microphone\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_microphone</a></p>\n<p>...\nand the rarely-used these days carbon powder pressure sensor (I really can't find a good webpage, but take my word that these do exist and I have one in my 1982 car).</p>\n<p>The only difference between the two is the mechanical design and, of course, the field of application. The principle of operation is the same.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Now I am curious, if I attach a speaker to the oil pressure sensor, will I hear the sound of the oil pump teeth?</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>This is going to be a long post-like question so make sure you have enough time before reading this. And this I got after thinking continuously for about 4 hours on the same question and I want to verify that if my ideology about this question is correct. First, what the question actually is?</p>\n<h1>Question</h1>\n<h3>Please refer to the diagram in image</h3>\n<h3>Explanation of the Image (You can skip this)</h3>\n<p>The image of the question is just below, please refer to it for better visualization. There are two blocks A and B. Block A has a mass of <span class=\"math-container\">$m$</span> while block two has a mass of <span class=\"math-container\">$2m$</span>. They are placed on top of each other. The surface between them (Block A and B) has a coefficient of friction <span class=\"math-container\">$\\mu$</span> and that between Block B and ground is <span class=\"math-container\">$2\\mu$</span>. In front of these two blocks is a wall that has a pulley attached to it (the wall). Now the block A is attached to a string which then runs over the pulley which is attached to the wall. And from that pulley, the string runs over another pulley which is attached to Block B and this string finally terminates getting attached back to the wall ( refer image for better visualization ). Now a force <span class=\"math-container\">$\\overleftarrow{F}$</span> is applied on the Block A.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rKalW.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rKalW.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Actual Question</h3>\n<p>What would be the minimum value of <span class=\"math-container\">$F$</span> so that the blocks start to move?</p>\n<h1>My Solution</h1>\n<h3>One Note Before Starting This</h3>\n<p>Whenever I say a force being &quot;paid by a system&quot;, I mean either it gets canceled by another force on the system or it gets exerted on the system. Also, the source of the force mentioned above in the main title of the question refers to the main force <span class=\"math-container\">$\\overleftarrow{F}$</span> acting on the system.</p>\n<h3>Now the solution</h3>\n<p>The most shocking thing I learned while solving this question was that the friction between block A and B will be paid two times all differently by the same force <span class=\"math-container\">$\\overleftarrow{F}$</span> acting in disguise on the two blocks. This was shocking as I first thought that the friction will be the usual force paid by the two blocks in some ration and not two times. But what I came to figure out was that it will be paid by each block separately and the amount of force of friction paid will be the same for two blocks and not in some ratio and those two will actually be the action-reaction pairs. One way we can thing about this is that the first block let's say starts moving in the left direction then it will exert a force of friction (which would be the reaction pair of the friction on block A) on the second block. Now to overcome this force the second block will pay the same amount of force in opposite direction. Hence the two pairs of force which are action-reaction pairs will be paid differently by each block. Now, these two pairs will be equal to <span class=\"math-container\">$\\mu N$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\">$N$</span> is the Normal force by Block A on B. And <span class=\"math-container\">$N = mg$</span>. Hence</p>\n<p>Friction b/w Block A and B <span class=\"math-container\">$ = \\mu N \\\\ \\rightarrow  \\mu mg$</span></p>\n<p>Friction b/w Block B and ground <span class=\"math-container\">$= 2\\mu N \\\\ \\rightarrow 2\\mu(3m)g \\\\  \\rightarrow 6\\mu mg$</span></p>\n<p><strong>For Block A</strong></p>\n<p>Now on block A, there is a force <span class=\"math-container\">$\\overleftarrow{F}$</span> and a friction <span class=\"math-container\">$\\mu mg$</span> which would be paid completely by this block so the tension <span class=\"math-container\">$T$</span> in the string would be</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$$ T = F - \\mu mg $$</span>\nLet's say this equation one.</p>\n<p><strong>For Block B</strong></p>\n<p>Now there is <span class=\"math-container\">$2T$</span> on block B and friction from the ground and surface above and remember that this block will pay its reaction pair separately. Hence</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$$ 6\\mu mg + \\mu mg = 2T $$</span></p>\n<p>Let's say this equation two.</p>\n<p>Analyzing equation 1 and 2 we get</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$$7\\mu mg = 2F - 2\\mu mg \\\\ F = \\frac{9\\mu mg}{2}$$</span></p>\n<h1>Final Question</h1>\n<p>Now here I want to ask that was this way of thinking correct or was it just a coincidence that I reached this solution? And thank you for spending your precious time on this question to help me out.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I try to measure neodymium magnet magnetic field strength, exactly - how it depends on distance to magnet, by using integrated magnetometer sensor in Huawei phone.

Because magnetic field has dipole nature - I was expected to get field dropping <span class=\"math-container\">$\\propto r^{-3}$</span> relationship to distance.\nBut to my surprise, that was not the case.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I've been reading up on the internet as to why the sky is blue. The answer usually cites Rayleigh scattering that I've checked on wikipedia: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering</a>:</p>\n\n<p>$$\nI=I_0 \\frac{1+\\cos^2\\theta}{2R^2}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right)^4\\left(\\frac{n^2-1}{n^2+2}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^6\n$$</p>\n\n<p>This answer raises more questions in my mind, that I hope some people can help to answer. </p>\n\n<p>First of all, I can't understand the $\\lambda^{-4}$ dependence in that equation. It means that the scattered intensity goes to infinity as $\\lambda\\to 0$. It also means that the observed intensity $I$ can be greater than the incident intensity $I_0$.</p>\n\n<p>On several web pages, the $\\lambda^{-4}$ dependence has been cited to explain why the sky is blue, but that doesn't make sense either. According to this reasoning the sky should be purple or indigo which has a higher frequency than blue. I've seen another explanation online that says that the sunlight impinging on our atmosphere has less indigo frequency than blue. However I can see the indigo part of a rainbow; it doesn't seem significantly dimmer than the blue part, so sunlight must have a decent indigo frequency content and as mentioned, the 4th power is a very strong dependency. This argument says that the sky ought to be indigo.</p>\n\n<p>A second question I have is concerning the angle dependency. $1+\\cos^2 \\theta$ has a maximum at zero and at 180, and a minimum at 90 degrees. According to this dependency the sky should look brightest when looking at 0 degrees (towards the sun), and 180 degrees (with the sun to your back), but it should have half the intensity at 90 degrees. This doesn't match with our experience of the sky. Given the hand-wavy nature of the explanations, I wonder if Rayleigh scattering truly is the explanation for why the sky is blue. </p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>You have not understood that the observed spectrum depends on $I_0 \\lambda^{-4}$, where $I_0$ is the incident spectrum of light - i.e. it is also wavelength dependent. A pure $\\lambda^{-4}$ scattered light spectrum would only be recovered if you shone pure white light at the atmosphere.</p>\n\n<p>Sunlight is much weaker in the violet part of the spectrum. So, even though violet light is more efficiently scattered, the mixture of wavelengths simply shifts from <em>appearing</em> white (to our eyes) for pure, unfiltered sunlight, to blue for scattered sunlight. The plot below (from the wikipedia page on sunlight shows what claims to be spectra of direct sunlight versus that scattered from a blue sky. You can indeed see that the ratio of light at ~450 nm (blue) to that at 360-400 nm (violet) is bigger in scattered sunlight than in direct sunlight, but the still broad spread of wavelengths results in a blue appearance.</p>\n\n<p>In detail: taking the ratio of the (scaled) blue-sky curve and direct sunlight curves. The ratio is 2 at 400 nm, and 1 at 465 nm and 0.5 at 575 nm. This compares to $(465/400)^4 = 1.83$ and $(465/575)^4= 0.43$. Given the limitations of reading the plot, that seems quite close to a $\\lambda^{-4}$ dependence.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6EzBe.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6EzBe.png\" alt=\"Rayleigh scattered sunlight\"></a></p>\n\n<p>You cannot just apply the Rayleigh scattering cross-section for arbitrarily small wavelengths. If the photons become energetic enough then the cross-section turns over and becomes the constant Thomson scattering cross-section.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the eye has a logarithmic response to brightness. I have not made the measurements myself, but I could easily believe that the brightness of the sky fell by a factor of two between close to the Sun and at right angles to the Sun. Further issues that complicate a straightforward interpretation are that any <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_scattering\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mie scattering</a> caused by larger particles in the atmosphere is much stronger at small angles and that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_mass_(astronomy)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">air mass</a> of scatterers will also vary as a function of zenith distance - your quoted relationship has to be multiplied by number of scatterers. There are also issues around the range of angles that scattered light comes from.</p>\n",

By interpretation it is meant that the mathematical predictions of the quantum mechanics formalism are the same, but the philosophical meaning of each is what differs.

Before the measurement the system can be in a superposition of states. It is supposed that the cat is not conscious thus, in that interpretation the wave function does not collapse and the cat is in a superposition of states. If a human opens the box then the function collapses to either live or death. The human observer will not be in a superposition of states.</p>\n\n<p>But this is an old interpretation and the are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics\">many others</a>.

            " <p>In a bubble chamber experiment, film was the detecting medium, but film was taken automatically, by the thousands of frames. These bobbins of film went to the various laboratories involved in the experiment, and were scanned for interesting events which were measured and the cross sections for the interactions recorded.</p>\n\n<p>This is a clear example of an experimental measurement of a quantum mechanical level interaction . It is easy to see where the quantum mechanical level ends and the classical regime begins. There has never been a doubt whether the events recorded on the films were there or disappeared at the next scanning, (i.e. had a quantum mechanical probability to have disappeared). The film record is demonstrably permanent and therefore classical. The cat thought experiment could be carried out in a laboratory  easily (fortunately no sadist has done so) . In what follows  I make  the analogy film - cat, pointing up where the quantum mechanical regime to be studied is and where the recording classical regime.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the first Omega minus seen, the cherry at the bottom of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eightfold_Way_(physics)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">decuplet</a> pyramid, a prediction of the quark model.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2hREA.gif\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2hREA.gif\" alt=\"omega minus\"></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.hep.fsu.edu/~wahl/satmorn/history/Omega-minus.asp.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The bubble chamber picture of the first omega-minus</a>. An incoming K- meson interacts with a proton in the liquid hydrogen of the bubble chamber and produces an omega-minus, a K\u00b0 and a K+ meson which all decay into other particles. Neutral particles which produce no tracks in the chamber are shown by dashed lines. The presence and properties of the neutral particles are established by analysis of the tracks of their charged decay products and application of the laws of conservation of mass and energy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The omega minus was there from the exposure of the film. That is the detector. Any scanner will find it again and again, because the film is not  a quantum mechanical state. It is a macroscopic classical detector. The quantum mechanical state was when the K- interacted with a proton in the bubble chamber, which had a probability of manifesting in the chamber. The recording of the event is detection.</p>\n\n<p>In an analogous way, the cat in this (misguided  in my opinion) thought experiment is the detector, the film, on which the experiment with the radioactive probabilities is recorded. It is the radioactive probabilities that are in a quantum mechanical state. The cat is the film. Until looked at, similar to the film being blank or recorded with an event, it is guessed to be dead or alive. Whatever it is, is decided by the quantum mechanical probability, and will be a stable solution of the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Let us see more detail, from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat#Thought_experiment\" rel=\"noreferrer\">wikipedia article</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One can even set up quite ridiculous cases. A cat is penned up in a steel chamber, along with the following device (which must be secured against direct interference by the cat): in a Geiger counter, there is a tiny bit of radioactive substance, so small, that perhaps in the course of the hour one of the atoms decays, but also, with equal probability, perhaps none; if it happens, the counter tube discharges and through a relay releases a hammer that shatters a small flask of hydrocyanic acid. If one has left this entire system to itself for an hour, one would say that the cat still lives if meanwhile no atom has decayed. The first atomic decay would have poisoned it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The quantum mechanical probability in this version, is the probability that the radioactive substance will decay within the hour. This probability is controlled by the quantum mechanical wave function of the nucleus, (the analogue of the K- proton interaction)  multiplied by the number of nuclei in the radioactive sample. The further steps in the experimental setup are macroscopic: the trigger of discharging the tube, the breaking of the poison and the cat are the detector setup (analogue of hydrogen bubble chamber, camera, film). The cat is the film because it is the permanent record of what happened within that hour (analogue of a film frame being a permanent record of whether there is an interaction or not).</p>\n\n<p>Please note that the cat is a superfluous sacrifice to a vague analogy. The counter would have been enough if it was recorded on an audio tape. The cat takes the place of the tape. The quantum mechanical probability function controlling the event is the original decay probability function.</p>\n\n<p>Cat and film are in the classical regime, <em>because h_bar is such a small number</em> that   the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Heisenberg Uncertainty</a> is always satisfied by macroscopic ensembles, larger than nano dimensions. True quantum mechanical behaviors, i.e. controlled by a probability density,  appear macroscopically only in very special situations (as superconductivity for an example).</p>\n\n<p>In general macroscopic objects are in the classical regime, the framework of the <a href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemistry/5-74-introductory-quantum-mechanics-ii-spring-2009/lecture-notes/MIT5_74s09_lec12.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">density matrix</a> helps acquiring an intuition how the transition happens, between quantum mechanical wave functions and classical dimensions. </p>\n",

            " <p>In Schrodinger's cat experiment, the scientist is assumed to be an \"classical observer\" of the state of the cat, and thus all observations made by the scientist are assumed to be classical observations adhering to physics as we knew it before quantum mechanics came along.

This is a completely valid interpretation of QM, it just doesn't explore the philosophical question that Schrodinger's cat was intended to explore.</p>\n\n<p>The philosophical side of the question is also why the topic of consciousness comes up regarding Schrodinger's cat.  If you really start digging at the philosophy of science, it all eventually boils down to the question of what does it mean to observe the world, as a conscious living being.  When we think about \"observations\" intuitively, disregarding QM for a moment, the observations we make fit well with the \"classical\" model of the world.  They fit rather poorly with the QM world.  Thus it is this classical intuitive observer that we need to line up with the data we observe, or we must admit that we have a contradiction in our observations.</p>\n\n<p>On the practical side, it is extremely difficult to get macroscopic objects to exhibit non-trivial quantum behavior because the particles in such objects are typically very decoherent.

If you do not know, you can only assume 4 significant figures.</p>\n",
            " <p>I teach high school in the United States.  I want to preface with that, because conventions common in one context are not necessarily universal.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, it's pretty standard teaching practice here (at least in every class I've ever taken, taught, or known a colleague to teach) to assume that trailing zeroes are not significant unless otherwise noted.  So, in the example of $1500$, I automatically assume that measurement to have two significant figures unless noted otherwise.  There are multiple ways that you could note a different amount of significant digits:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Use Scientific Notation</strong>- This is probably the best way, in general, to indicate the number of digits that are significant, because any digit in your multiplier prior to the power of ten is significant.  For example $1.5 \\times 10^3$ has two significant digits, because $1.5$ has two significant digits.  If I wanted to indicate that all four digits are significant, I would instead write $1.500 \\times 10^3$ where intentionally writing the extra zeros after the decimal shows that they are significant.  I could easily repeat the process for three significant digits, using only one trailing zero after the decimal.  However, depending on the order of magnitude of your measurement, it may feel silly or cumbersome to use scientific notation so you could...</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Use other markers to indicate significance</strong>- At least around here, it's pretty common to end your number with a decimal point to indicate significance on all digits.  For example, if I wanted to explicitly indicate significance on all four digits in your example, I could write it as $1500.$ with a decimal point after the final zero.  Because the decimal is not needed for any other reason, it's only there to indicate significance of the zero's to the left.  Well what if the first zero is significant but the second zero is not, for a total of three significant digits?  Then I would indicate the last significant zero with a bar either above or below the zero.  So either $15\\bar00$ or $15\\underline00$ could represent three significant digits.  Like I said above $1500$ with no other marks augmenting it is typically assumed to only have two significant figures.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now, I fully recognize that at the research level, there are far better ways to indicate precision and relative uncertainty.  However, this strikes me as a high-school level question, so there's your high-school level answer.</p>\n",
            " <p>In physics, all numbers are imprecise. Significant figures are conceptually the digits that it is meaningful to include in the reported result.</p>\n\n<h1>The concept</h1>\n\n<p>When you read a gauge, the reading error is half the smallest interval on its scale - you basically take the value of the tick nearest to the hand's position (digital gauges do this for you).</p>\n\n<p>So, if the reading is <code>1503</code> (the scale step is <code>1</code>), it basically means that it's actually <code>1503\u00b10.5</code>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>150</code> are precise</li>\n<li><code>3</code> is precise, too (in the true value, it can be 3 or 2 but when rounded to 4 digits, it will always be 3)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, it's meaningful to only include the 4 digits into the result. Including further ranks would be meaningless since they can be anything in the true value - they wouldn't actually carry any additional information.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if a result (of a calculation, probably) is something like <code>1534.35056\u00b13.50584</code> (the relative error is 2.3%)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the leading <code>153</code> are precise</li>\n<li><code>4</code> is somewhat precise (in the true value, it can be anything from 0 to 7)</li>\n<li>the following figures are spurious (can be anything in the true value)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Since <code>4</code> is rather imprecise, it's reasonable to include the next digit as well: <code>1534\u00b14</code> gives 2.6% error (worse than it actually is) while <code>1534.4\u00b13.5</code> gives the correct 2.3%.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>So,</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the concept (and thus the number) of significant figures <em>only has meaning if the precision is given or implied.</em></li>\n<li><p>when the precision is implied</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>it's typically implied the error is ~0.5 of the last significant rank (i.e. all the digits given are implied to be strictly precise). When it's not so, the error must be specified explicitly. This implication mostly stands for numbers written in scientific notation (<code>n.nnnE[-]n</code>). (let's call it the <em>\"scientific implication\"</em>)</li>\n<li>For integer numbers written in plain (especially large round ones and especially in \"inaccurate\" domains like statistics), it's as usually implied that only the leading non-zero digits are \"precise\" while the zeros are just the padding for readability (in these domains, all numbers are often padded to thousands/millions/etc). (let's call it the <em>\"layman implication\"</em>)</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Application</h1>\n\n<p>In addition to the general cases given above, there are a few rules made out of pure convenience:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>leading zeros are never needed: <code>0.000045</code> is much more readable as <code>4.5e-5</code>.</li>\n<li>trailing zeros are not needed <em>unless precision is implied and they're the \"precise\" digits:</em> <code>12.40</code> implies precision <code>0.01</code> (error <code>0.005</code>) while <code>12.4</code> implies precision <code>0.1</code> (error <code>0.05</code>). In <code>1500000</code>, if only two zeros are actually precise, it should be written as <code>1.500e6</code>.\nIt's because of these implications that it's so important to watch the trailing zeros - to avoid giving a false implication.</li>\n</ul>\n",

There is no violation of the energy conservation law here.</p>\n\n<p>What you may be annoyed by is that the final energy of the electron usually isn't equal to the expectation value of energy in the state before the measurement. It's surely true. But there is no reason why it should be. The expectation value isn't any \"objective value\" of energy. It's just a statistical average of many possibilities, and only some of them will be realized, as dictated by the probabilities predicted by quantum mechanics.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish, the process of measurement violates the \"conservation of the expectation value of energy\".</p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, this \"violation\" can't be used to obtain any sharp contradiction with the conservation law for the \"actual\" energy. You may only interpret the measured energy in a \"classical way\" after decoherence, which means after the measuring apparatus has interacted with the environmental degrees of freedom (that are needed for decoherence). If you prepare your harmonic oscillator plus the apparatus in a state whose total energy is sufficiently sharply well-defined to reveal the \"violation of the conservation law for the expectation value\", the environmental degrees of freedom will inevitably spoil this accuracy.</p>\n",
            " <p>A QM wave function describes an ensemble of measurements, not the single measurement output. The corresponding potential does not describe the perturbation due to measurement. If you only measure the system energy, it will be $E_0$, of course, because you measure the eigenstate of the corresponding operator. </p>\n\n<p>But the coordinate operator does not commute with the Hamiltonian, the ground state is not its eigenstate so you will get dispersion in coordinate measurements. While measuring coordinate you may introduce a perturbation that changes the initial state. Now you may have a superposition of eigenstates of Hamiltonian. No wonder you may then find energies different from the ground state.</p>\n",
            " <p>What is interesting about this question is that the answers may display its author's Interpretation of QM. Let us first review the order of events here:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Particle is prepared in Ground State $\\psi_0$ (an Energy Eigenstate)</li>\n<li>Particle is position measured with observable X (measurement-1)</li>\n<li>Particle is now in a Position Eigenstate</li>\n<li>Particle is now Energy measured (measurement-2)</li>\n<li>Particle is in state $\\psi_{21/2}$</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In this example energy has been given to the particle.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly this is similar to an atom's electron becoming excited. If this has happened via a collision or photon absorption during either measurement, then the particle will only absorb an integral quantums worth of energy.</p>\n\n<p>However since the Hamiltonian in this case is $H=1/2(p^2 + x^2)$, then $[X,H]=\\hbar p\\neq0$.\nSo the quantum formalist can simply take the Copenhagen view that since the observables dont commute no guarantees can be given about their eigenvalues staying the same after such measurement history. And no further explanation as to \"why\" need be given beyond \"quantum fluctuation\" (or \"quantum randomness\" if you prefer). Thus there is no \"microtheory\" explaining where the energy (in this case - maybe extra momentum in another case) came from.</p>\n\n<p>Further considerations: (1) if one entertains a \"hidden variable\" philosophy then this experiment needs to be explained by that means. (2) This experiment has similarities to the quantum vacuum explanations for spontaneous emission. If such a model could apply here then we could say that the particle has had a random payoff from the quantum vacuum, perhaps mediated by one of the measurements.</p>\n\n<p>Also any entanglement between measurement instrument and particle is supposed to have ended shortly after measurement as a result of decoherence between a classical object and a quantum one.</p>\n",
            " <p>For a high degree of accuracy you would have to probe the particle with a high energy (short wavelength) photon so there is plenty of energy that can go into vibrational excitation. After such hard hit the particle will be smeared across a wide range of states $$\\Psi=a_0*\\Psi_0+a_1*\\Psi_1+...$$This is not an entanglement but a simple superposition of eigenstates. The expectation value of the particle's energy $\\bar{E}=\\sum_{i}a_i^2E_i$ should not be equal to the energy of any particular state and the second measurement will yield $E_i$ with $a_i^2$ probability.</p>\n\n<p>So, the extra energy comes from an interaction with a probe particle and it doesn't have to be precisely equal to the energy of a certain vibrational state.</p>\n",
            " <p>Thinking about your question has led me to the following conclusion:</p>\n\n<p>Suppose there is a a conserved quantity $Y$, and an isolated system $S$. Let's also suppose the isolation is temporarily lifted to measure an observable $\\widehat{X}$ of $S$. This measurement is performed by a measuring apparatus $A$. For simplicity, let's lump together the rest of the universe outside the system including the apparatus and the environment into $A$. Let's further assume we have a tensor product structure between $S$ and $A$ for the Hilbert space. Let $\\widehat{Y}_S$ and $\\widehat{Y}_A$ be the restriction of $\\widehat{Y}$ to $S$ and $A$ respectively.  Then, the sum $\\widehat{Y}_S + \\widehat{Y}_A$ has to be conserved.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's suppose $\\widehat{Y}_S$ and $\\widehat{X}$ don't commute. Let's see what happens if we further make an assumption very common in measurement theory that for systems starting out in an eigenstate of $X$, a perfect measurement will leave it in an eigenstate of $X$ with the same eigenvalue. The Hilbert space of $A$ decomposes into eigenspaces of a pointer operator $\\widehat{P}$ such that after a measurement of an eigenstate of $X$, $A$ ends up in an eigenstate of $\\widehat{P}$ with an eigenvalue equal to the eigenvalue of $X$.</p>\n\n<p>As $\\widehat{Y}_S$ and $\\widehat{X}$ don't commute, there exists an eigenvalue of $X$ such that all nonzero eigenstates of it aren't also $\\widehat{Y}_S$ eigenstates. With all these assumptions in place, an initial state of $\\sum_n c_n \\left| x_n \\right\\rangle$ will evolve into\n$$\\sum_n c_n \\left| x_n \\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left| \\chi_n \\right\\rangle$$\nwhere $\\left| \\chi_m \\right\\rangle$ and $\\left| \\chi_n \\right\\rangle$ are orthogonal if $m \\neq n$ because they have different pointer values. Let's further assume $A$ is initially in an eigenstate of $\\widehat{Y}_A$. Assume that the system is initially in an eigenstate of $\\widehat{Y}_S$ with eigenvalue $y_m$ which isn't also an eigenstate of $X$. Then, this state can be expressed as $\\sum_n U_{mn} \\left| x_n \\right\\rangle$ with $U_{mn}$ being nonzero for at least two different values of $n$. The final state is\n$$\\sum_{np} U_{mn} U_{pn}^* \\left| y_p \\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left| \\chi_n \\right\\rangle$$\nIf we look at the contribution to the sum for one of the values of $n$ for which $U_{mn}$ is nonzero, we find the combined $S+A$ system can't be in an eigenstate of $\\widehat{Y}$. Precisely because the $\\chi$'s are orthogonal, the contributions from different $n$'s can't cancel, and this remains true for the wavefunction as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>But of course, $\\widehat{Y}$ generates a symmetry, and $\\widehat{X}$ is not invariant under this symmetry. So, to measure $X$, the initial state of the apparatus can't possibly be invariant under this symmetry either. So, we shouldn't expect $A$ to start in an eigenstate of $\\widehat{Y}_A$. The measurement process itself is expected to change $\\widehat{Y}_S$, but we have a compensating change in $\\widehat{Y}_A$.</p>\n",
            " <p>If I understand correctly, the key question in the topmost post is in this sentence \"measurement-1 which probed the position of the particle can\u2019t have delivered to it a precise amount of energy\".</p>\n\n<p>Now, what I am thinking is that, if you really measure the position of a system (or a component of a system), then measure the energy of this system again, will you really get a discrete spectrum of energies (in the case of a simple harmonic oscillator)?</p>\n\n<p>I guess not, because measuring the position can perturb the overall momentum of the system, thus changing the translational energy, which has a continuous spectrum.</p>\n\n<p>So in the case of harmonic oscillator, after measuring its position, the wave function will not be a superposition of the discrete eigenfunctions, but rather an integral of a continua of eigenfunctions, which include the cases with nonzero translational energies.</p>\n\n<p>But I believe the point here is not really about \"position measurement\".  I mean, maybe position measurement is just a bad example.  One could devise other types of measurements to collapse an energy-eigenstate into a superpositional one (of discrete energy levels).  If the measurement is designed careful enough, I believe the process by which a discrete amount of energy is transferred to or from the system being measured will become very clear.</p>\n",
            " <p>I read the original question and all six answers above. I do not think that these answers directly answer the question. There is energy transferring from the apparatus to the particle, amounting to an uncontrollable disturbance of the momentum, indicated also by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in the context of the measuring position of an electron using a light beam focusing on it. The original question is, how the energy transformation is made during the measurement? Or, how the energy flows from the apparatus to the particle? Or, is there any dynamical mechanism? As far as I know, there is NO answer within the current formalism of quantum mechanics. </p>\n"

            " <p>No.  The easiest way to see this without invoking rotating reference frames is to write out <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics_of_planar_particle_motion#Polar_coordinates_in_an_inertial_frame_of_reference\">Newton's Law's in polar coordinates</a>, which work out to be:\n\\begin{align*}\nF_r &amp;= m \\ddot{r} - m r \\dot{\\phi}^2 \\\\\nF_\\phi &amp;= m r \\ddot{\\phi} + 2 m \\dot{r} \\dot{\\phi} \n\\end{align*}\nFrom these, it's pretty easy to see that if we have $F_\\phi = 0$ and $\\dot{r} \\neq 0$ (i.e., no tangential forces but a decreasing radius), we will still get $\\ddot{\\phi} = \\dot{\\omega} \\neq 0$.</p>\n\n<p>The question you might ask, then, is why do Newton's Laws look so strange in polar coordinates?  Why are those extra terms present on the right-hand side of the equations?  The answer is that the \"real\" equation is that $\\vec{F} = m \\ddot{\\vec{r}}$.  If we express $\\vec{r}$ in, say, Cartesian components ($\\vec{r} = x \\hat{x} + y \\hat{y}$), then the vectors $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{y}$ are constant with respect to time;  thus, $\\ddot{r} = \\ddot{x} \\hat{x} + \\ddot{y} \\hat{y}$.  However, if express the particle's position in polar coordinates ($\\vec{r} = r \\hat{r}$), then $\\hat{r}$ is <em>not</em> constant with respect to time;  so when we take the derivative of $\\vec{r}$ with respect to time, we get unexpected terms.

So how does the rock gain angular velocity? If you truly are applying a purely radial force, and if you aren't shortening the length of the rope between your hand and the rock, the answer is that it can't. Radial forces do zero work.

            " <p>Atoms in free space without interactions between them have a clear set of energy levels. Their electrons have certain energies that can be classified as shells. The lower energy levels are filled, while the highest one can be not completely filled. The highest shell is called the valence shell; these are the most interesting for chemical bonds and reactions.</p>\n\n<p>If atoms are arranged in a crystal lattice, they are at very short distances from each other. The wave functions of the electrons overlap to some extent and there are a number of other interactions and disturbances (phonons, thermal variations, ...) that change the energy levels of each atom. In effect, this means that the valence band is not exactly at the same energy as for a free atom, but instead slightly higher or lower. Since there are on the order of $10^{23}$ atoms in a macroscopic crystal, there is a also consequently a large number of energy levels, all of which are very close together. This in effect looks and acts as a continuous energy <strong>band</strong>, not anymore as discrete, separate energy levels.</p>\n\n<p>However, it is important to note that this doesn't mean that the valence shell is broadened and forms the conduction band, or that the shell below the valence shell broadens and becomes the valence band.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, the valence shell and lower shell interact and form a new, hybrid shell. Each orbital in both shells is split in two, due to the Pauli exclusion principle. This combined band already contains $2N$ times as many states as a single, free atom has (where $N$ is the number of atoms in the lattice).</p>\n\n<p>This combined band is further separated into two parts by interactions between atoms in the crystal, so that conduction and valence band appear. The valence band is the band that lies below the Fermi energy, while the conduction band lies above it. During the splitting of the individual energy levels in the shells, the some levels of the valence shell can be higher (lower) than the Fermi level, so that they end up in the conduction (valence) band.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ctwYgm.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ctwYgm.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The electrical properties of solids can easily be described with this band model, without considering the individual energy levels of each single atom. For example, the separation between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied bands determines if the material is a insulator (large bandgap), semiconductor (small bandgap) or a conductor (no bandgap).</p>\n",
            " <p>The wave functions of electrons in the valence shell of atoms results from an Hamiltonian, where the potential term comes from the Coulomb interactions. </p>\n\n<p>When two or more atoms are close enough, the wave functions of valence electrons changes, because the potential term has to include the Coulomb attraction of the other nucleus (and electrons). For the inner orbitals the change of potential is less relevant. </p>\n\n<p>Bonds are formed when the energy eingenvalues of the shared valence electrons are lower than the case of isolated atoms.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of crystals, the periodic structure of the potential leads to wave functions called Bloch waves. They play the role of the valence orbital wave function of an isolated atom. While they are a product of a periodic function (with the periodicity of the crystal,  after all it is the source of the potential form) by a plane wave, we will focus in the plane wave part. A one-dimensional approach is the Kronig-Penney model, where band structures can be simulated. </p>\n\n<p>The lowest energy states correspond to wave lengths of the whole crystal. Then come the others until when it matches the atomic space. It is the same logic of quantized waves in a potential of a given length, and infinite energy boundaries. That completes the available states of the valence band.</p>\n\n<p>For some metals, (ex: alkali metals) the valence orbital for one isolated atom has one electron, but it is possible to have another one of the opposite spin (to form an ion). They would have <strong>almost</strong> the same quantum number, except for the spin. </p>\n\n<p>It translates in the band configuration as one state per atom, but as two electrons of opposite spin can occupy the same state (the same position wave function, but differing by the spin) they will fill all the lowest states of the band using that \"card\". Half of the band, with the higher energy levels remains unoccupied.</p>\n\n<p>They can easily migrate to adjacent levels in the case of an applied electric field, and these material have low resistivity.</p>\n\n<p>The quantized wave lengths can also be shorter than one atomic distance. The largest wave length in this case must be a little shorter than that distance, in order to skip all lattice points except for the first and last one. The shorter of that type will have half the atomic distance as its wave length. That is the second band.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible to simulate in the Kronig-Penney model that a gap may arise, depending on the potential function, separating that two bands. That is, an electron at the highest energy state of the lower band have no adjacent level to migrate. </p>\n\n<p>In that case, if the gap is large enough, and the valence band is completely full, (2 electrons for each band state), an electric field can't produce a current. The material is an isolator.</p>\n\n<p>If the gap exists but is not so large, thermal energy of room temperature can move some electrons to the next band, according to Fermi-Dirac statistics. The few electrons in the upper band can now freely move, because have adjacent states available. That band is then called conduction band. The first band have also some available states now, and adjacent electrons can migrate to them. That states are called holes, and the band is the valence band. </p>\n\n<p>That are the semiconductors, and the amount of electrons in the conduction band (and holes in the valence band) can be greatly increased by the process of doping.</p>\n",
            " <p>Within one electron description of the atomic states, valence electrons is an expression referring to the one-electron states which contribute significantly to  chemical bonds. Even though the most obvious shell to be considered as <em>valence shell</em> is the unfilled one, in many cases, it is necessary to take into account more than one shell in order to get a quantitative description of bond length and energies of molecules. For this reason from the point of view of atomic and molecular physics, valence shells is a generic name to denote the highest lying electronic states taking part to the formation of bonds. States at lower energies are usually referred as <em>core</em> states, and in many cases they can be treated as unperturbed by the chemical environment of an atom.</p>\n\n<p>Going from atoms to solids, one could expect that this naming convention would be extended in such a way that <em>valence band</em> or <em>bands</em> would denote the band(s) of Bloch's  states originating from the one-electron <em>valence states</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed this is the approach used in the popular Ashcroft&amp;Mermin textbook on <em>Solid State Physics</em>. In their Chapter 11, at the beginning of the section on \"General features of valence bands wavefunctions\" they clearly identify <strong>valence bands</strong> with the <strong>bands formed by the atomic states lying at energies higher than those of core states</strong>.\nHowever, there is a footnote in the same page, where they notice that a different meaning is used for the same expression in the theory of semiconductors.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, at the beginning of Chapter 28 on <em>Homogeneous semiconductors</em>, they define <strong>valence band</strong> in a semiconductor <strong>the highest occupied band</strong>, according to the established use in semiconductor physics.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the puzzling difference of definitions is actually due to real differences of naming conventions in different contexts. </p>\n",

Are they  the same but use different configuration parameters. for example 3-6-12 seconds vs 5 -10 - 20 mins ? </p></li>\n<li><p>What are the <strong>interaction design implications</strong> that I need to consider when adopting a temporary lockout mechanism? Can I let the user know when they will be able to try again? Perhaps using some form of visual indicator?  </p></li>\n<li><p>What are the most adapted <strong>time-frames for pauses between failed login attempts</strong> that will not frustrate the end user? <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/570160/throttling-login-attempts\">This post on stakoverflow seems to suggest seconds rather than mins</a></p></li>\n<li><p>What impact does this have on <strong>Denial of Service</strong>?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Update: Clarifications</strong> </p>\n\n<p>A bit more to clarify! when a Login fails the \"try again\" button is disabled a for a duration of 3 sec after which it is enabled.The user attempts to login again and fails, the \"try again\" button becomes inactive for 6 sec. </p>\n\n<p>The process is repeated for 5 consecutive attempts and error messages direct users to reset their password.At the 5th attempt users are presented with a password reset screen. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand users could attempt to login and have a specified number of attempts after which the account is \"locked\" for a period of time, say 5 mins this increases to 10 mins after another set of attempts. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks  </p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>\"Throttling\" and \"temporary lockout\" are exactly the same thing.  </p>\n\n<p>It is likely, however, that your dev team misunderstood the concepts, and assumed you meant \"throttling\" like most of the other answers here did (with the exception of <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/a/74219/33\">@R15</a>, though that is less an answer and more of important considerations). </p>\n\n<p>The important point that they are missing is simply this:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The entire <em>Raison d'\u00eatre</em> of temporary lockout <strong>IS</strong> login throttling. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The account lockout is not a punishment for the user, nor does it automatically grant the account Magik Powers of Immunity from all attacks while it is locked.   </p>\n\n<p>The reason the temporary lockout works, is that it is effectively setting a minimum amount of time to do X number of login attempts.<br>\nIn other words, a maximum number of login attempts within Y period of time.  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Let's give an example: </p>\n\n<p>With no brute-force protection, let's say an attacker can attempt 1000 passwords / second. According to <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/936/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this classic XKCD</a>, most \"complex\" passwords would have up to 28 bits of entropy. At 1000 guesses/second, that would take approximately 3 days to brute force.   </p>\n\n<p>Now, let's assume you have brute force protection in place (throttling / account lockout) : <code>After X passwords, lock the account for Y amount of time</code>. Or phrased as throttling: <code>Allow only X passwords every Y amount of time.</code><br>\nClearly these are the same.... regardless of whether Y is 30 seconds or 30 minutes. <em>And they both would work.</em> </p>\n\n<p>But lets have a play.... </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>To make it easy, we'll set the above X=10 (allowed wrong passwords), Y=10 minutes (lockout time). At that rate (it's actually 1 guess per minute, on average, just to make things easy) - it will take just over <em>500 years</em> to guess (on average).   </li>\n<li>Okay, let's lower the parameters... X=5 guesses, Y=30 seconds. Same password would take just over 50 years (since, on average, your throttle rate is 10 guesses per minute).   </li>\n<li>Or, as you seem to have intended, X=1 guess per every Y=10 seconds (?): with an average of 6 guesses per minute, it would take around 85 years to brute force the password... </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of course you can tune those parameters as makes sense for your system, and especially, as @R15 said earlier, <em>this should be in relation to the strength of your users' passwords</em>.<br>\nHowever, whether you consider this to be \"account lockout\" or \"account throttling\" is the same exact thing, since the first is merely a simple implementation to achieve the second. </p>\n",

            " <p>There is indeed a lot of unclear information out there. Your first idea was correct, to the best of my knowledge. While I can't seem to find an authoritative source right now, <a href=\"https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Wireless_security\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this DD-WRT wiki page</a> explains it the way I understand it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>TKIP vs AES-based CCMP</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Defines the algorithm used for message integrity and confidentiality.</p>\n  \n  <p>WPA was designed to be used with TKIP (and WPA2 designed to use\n  stronger AES-based).</p>\n  \n  <p>However, some devices allow WPA (not WPA2) with AES (and WPA2 with\n  TKIP).</p>\n  \n  <p>AES is optional in WPA; in WPA2 both AES is mandatory, but TKIP is\n  optional.</p>\n  \n  <p>Note that TKIP is not directly comparable to AES; TKIP is an integrity\n  check, AES is an encryption algorithm. In the context of wireless\n  security this actually means TKIP vs \"AES-based CCMP\" (not just AES).</p>\n  \n  <p>TKIP is a lower end encryption protocol (WEP2) and AES is a higher end\n  (WPA2/802.11i) encryption protocol. AES is preferred.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>TKIP+AES</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>This is what the encryption standards are for WEP2 (TKIP) and\n  WPA2/802.11i (AES). It will attempt to use AES if available and fall\n  back to TKIP if not. This setting offers the most compatability but\n  won't guarentee a higher level of encryption if a device falls back to\n  TKIP.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It gets even more confusing; my access point running OpenWRT supports the following modes, among others:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>WPA with CCMP, TKIP, or both </li>\n<li>WPA2 with CCMP, TKIP, or both</li>\n<li>Mixed WPA/WPA2 with CCMP, TKIP, or both</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Nowadays, the only relevant option is WPA2 with CCMP (or WPA3, of course).</p>\n",
            " <p>Some historical perspective should help to shed some light on the confusion. The gist is that \"backward compatibility\" is the reason we still see TKIP around.</p>\n\n<p>802.11-based WLANs originally came only with WEP, which was soon discovered to be too easily cracked to be sufficient for general usage in WLANs.</p>\n\n<p>IEEE started working on 802.11i, an amendment to add a much more robust security framework to 802.11-based WLANs. However, in the meantime, the Wi-Fi Alliance introduced WPA with a stop-gap scheme, TKIP, as it was taking time for 802.11i to be published, and meanwhile, there were fears that the momentum of 802.11 could be broken due to poor security. (the exponential growth of 802.11 from 1999 onwards was part of the reason why the security issues suddenly became so urgent)</p>\n\n<p>TKIP - temporary key integrity protocol - as part of WPA, addresses some of the main problems of WEP related to weaknesses in the use of keys. With TKIP, it was still using RC4 with relatively short keys, but at least, doing much improved key mixing to partially address the security concerns.</p>\n\n<p>Backward compatibility was a major reason for the use of TKIP and other less computationally complex algorithms like MICHAEL in WPA. The issue was that the hardware in many of the WLAN devices in those days was deemed not powerful enough to perform AES encryption/decryption, but at least they could have WPA with TKIP.</p>\n\n<p>Later on, 802.11i was published. WPA2 then appeared, basically incorporating the enhancements introduced in 802.11i. There are both the enterprise and the PSK  modes, but definitely, WPA2-PSK with AES/CCMP is stronger than WPA2-PSK with TKIP.</p>\n\n<p>For backward compatibility reasons (in case you're trying to connect a low end device that doesn't support AES), TKIP is still supported by some WiFi access points (typically, trying AES first and then falling back to TKIP; it could be called by various names like TKIP+AES). But generally, unless you really need to support that one or two old/low end devices in your network, it would be better to just go with WPA2 (PSK or enterprise) with AES/CCMP.</p>\n"

I used the Android app to read the different articles about different ways of \"hacking\". The author clearly stated that some of them shouldn't be reproduce because they would basically harm the computer, such as the famous <em>Zip bomb</em> and <em>Fork bomb</em> or even <em>Folder blaster</em>.</p>\n\n<p>So, I'm wondering what would be the best way for me to reproduces these \"malwares\" without doing harm to my own computer. But I'm also interested of finding a way that I could use for many different kind of malware/virus testing/development.</p>\n\n<p>The first solution that comes to my mind is to use a Virtual Machine, so I could take a snapshot of the VM once installed and do whatever on it without harming the real OS. But I don't know for sure if this is the best solution and even if it's gonna work or not. I guess it would, but that's a guess.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

In that case the only way to test it is by using spare hardware.</p>\n",

            " <blockquote>\n  <p>How do professional hackers to test their own malwares/viruses without harming their own computer?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Almost all malware, if not all, works by obscurity. Once you understand how it works, and you have the appropriate skill-set, you can defeat it quite easily. If it's your <em>own</em> malware and viruses, then it's really quite simple: you know exactly what <em>your</em> malware does, and how to defeat it, correct? After all, you programmed it.</p>\n\n<p>While yes, I agree in general with the use of a Virtual Machine, it isn't 100%. Nothing is 100%. You can infect your own machines, whether they're online or offline, and do interesting things with them. </p>\n\n<p>You can observe how the malware interacts with your environment through many different methods. Here are some notable examples:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Observing all changes to the file system, and/or hard drives.</li>\n<li>Observing memory</li>\n<li>Debuggers such as <code>OllyDbg</code>, or <code>IDA Pro</code>.</li>\n<li>Network packet-capturing tools such as <code>Wireshark</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Disable the Virtual Machine's internet connection for best results</strong></p>\n\n<p>While others talk about malware \"possibly escaping\" the <code>Virtual Machine</code>, it isn't very likely, though it is possible. Even if the malware could detect that it's running inside a virtual machine, that doesn't help much unless the malware <code>self-destructs</code> upon detecting a virtual environment.  </p>\n\n<p>Even if a VM isn't detected, a piece of malware could simply <em>try</em> to escape it by assuming it may be there. So methods to prevent the malware from detecting it's inside a VM may not work, unless it's the type that self-destructs when detecting it. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding the \"attacks\" you've mentioned, let's take a look at the results of them, assuming you can remove the infections:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Zip bomb</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A zip bomb, also known as a zip of death or decompression bomb, is a malicious archive file designed to crash or render useless the program or system reading it. It is often employed to disable antivirus software, in order to create an opening for more traditional viruses.</li>\n<li>After removing the infection, the left-behind zip-bomb can be nullified by deleting the files. If you made this yourself, simply make a cleanup routine. If you didn't make it yourself, simply make a cleanup routine. If the program is still forcibly running, you can reboot. </li>\n<li>Won't cause physical problems with your hardware.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Fork bomb</strong> \n\n<ul>\n<li>In computing, a fork bomb (also called rabbit virus or wabbit) is a denial-of-service attack wherein a process continually replicates itself to deplete available system resources, causing resource starvation and slowing or crashing the system.</li>\n<li>Won't cause physical problems with your hardware.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Folder blaster</strong>.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Same concept as the zip bomb, but with folder spam. Just write a routine to delete them. </li>\n<li>Won't cause physical problems with your hardware.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Better yet, if you have a <code>virtual testing environment</code>, you can delete these automatically by saving the state of a virtual machine before the infection, and restoring it after you're done studying the output. This is the easiest, most efficient method by far. </p>\n"

Once you understand how it works, and you have the appropriate skill-set, you can defeat it quite easily. If it's your <em>own</em> malware and viruses, then it's really quite simple: you know exactly what <em>your</em> malware does, and how to defeat it, correct? After all, you programmed it.</p>\n\n<p>While yes, I agree in general with the use of a Virtual Machine, it isn't 100%. Nothing is 100%. You can infect your own machines, whether they're online or offline, and do interesting things with them. </p>\n\n<p>You can observe how the malware interacts with your environment through many different methods. Here are some notable examples:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Observing all changes to the file system, and/or hard drives.</li>\n<li>Observing memory</li>\n<li>Debuggers such as <code>OllyDbg</code>, or <code>IDA Pro</code>.</li>\n<li>Network packet-capturing tools such as <code>Wireshark</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Disable the Virtual Machine's internet connection for best results</strong></p>\n\n<p>While others talk about malware \"possibly escaping\" the <code>Virtual Machine</code>, it isn't very likely, though it is possible. Even if the malware could detect that it's running inside a virtual machine, that doesn't help much unless the malware <code>self-destructs</code> upon detecting a virtual environment.  </p>\n\n<p>Even if a VM isn't detected, a piece of malware could simply <em>try</em> to escape it by assuming it may be there. So methods to prevent the malware from detecting it's inside a VM may not work, unless it's the type that self-destructs when detecting it. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding the \"attacks\" you've mentioned, let's take a look at the results of them, assuming you can remove the infections:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Zip bomb</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A zip bomb, also known as a zip of death or decompression bomb, is a malicious archive file designed to crash or render useless the program or system reading it. It is often employed to disable antivirus software, in order to create an opening for more traditional viruses.</li>\n<li>After removing the infection, the left-behind zip-bomb can be nullified by deleting the files. If you made this yourself, simply make a cleanup routine. If you didn't make it yourself, simply make a cleanup routine. If the program is still forcibly running, you can reboot. </li>\n<li>Won't cause physical problems with your hardware.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Fork bomb</strong> \n\n<ul>\n<li>In computing, a fork bomb (also called rabbit virus or wabbit) is a denial-of-service attack wherein a process continually replicates itself to deplete available system resources, causing resource starvation and slowing or crashing the system.</li>\n<li>Won't cause physical problems with your hardware.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Folder blaster</strong>.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Same concept as the zip bomb, but with folder spam. Just write a routine to delete them. </li>\n<li>Won't cause physical problems with your hardware.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Better yet, if you have a <code>virtual testing environment</code>, you can delete these automatically by saving the state of a virtual machine before the infection, and restoring it after you're done studying the output. This is the easiest, most efficient method by far. </p>\n",

            " <p>The source of your confusion is an historical &quot;explanation&quot; of RSA signatures as being &quot;encryption of the hash with the private key&quot;. This explanation is confusing, and flawed in many ways. It works only for RSA. Actually it does not work for RSA either.</p>\n<p>Let's define things properly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>An <strong>asymmetric encryption</strong> system defines two functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Encrypt</code>: takes as inputs a <em>message</em> (a sequence of bytes, possibly limited in length) and a <em>public key</em>. It outputs a value in a given space of possible values (in the case of RSA, this is a big integer, no longer than the modulus).</li>\n<li><code>Decrypt</code>: takes as inputs an encrypted message (an output of <code>Encrypt</code>) and a private key, and produces back the original message (provided that the private key matches the public key which was used for encryption, of course).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>A <strong>signature algorithm</strong> defines two functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Sign</code>: takes as inputs a <em>message</em> (a sequence of bytes, usually not limited in length) and a <em>private key</em>. It outputs a value in a given space of possible values.</li>\n<li><code>Verify</code>: takes as inputs a message, a signature value (an output of <code>Sign</code>) and a public key, and outputs a boolean value (&quot;true&quot; on match, &quot;false&quot; otherwise).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since these four functions take different types of inputs and produce different kind of outputs, they cannot be swapped around.</p>\n<p>In general, asymmetric encryption algorithms and signature algorithms live in separate worlds. It so happens that there is an asymmetric encryption algorithm known as &quot;RSA&quot;, and there is a signature algorithm that is also known as &quot;RSA&quot;. Moreover, they both use the same kind of public/private key pairs. However, still generally speaking, encryption and signature keys <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/8559/digital-certificate-deployment-using-two-certs-for-each-user/8563#8563\">should be distinct</a>.</p>\n<p>If we look at the internals of RSA (both algorithms), as defined in <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3447\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PKCS#1</a>, then we may find some common elements, and others which are distinct.</p>\n<p>For <em>asymmetric encryption</em>, the message must be smaller (by at least 11 bytes) than the modulus. The message to encrypt is &quot;padded&quot; as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>0x00 0x02 rr rr ... rr 0x00 mm...\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <code>mm...</code> is the message, and the <code>rr</code> are random non-zero bytes. The number of <code>rr</code> bytes is adjusted so that the total length is equal to that of the modulus, and there must be at least eight such non-zero bytes (hence the restriction on the message length). The resulting sequence of bytes is <em>interpreted</em> as an integer modulo <em>N</em> (the &quot;modulus&quot; part of the public/private key pair), and raised to the public exponent modulo <em>N</em>. The result is the encrypted message: it is an integer modulo <em>N</em> (the convention is to encode that message in big-endian, yielding a sequence of bytes of the same length as the modulus).</p>\n<p>To give some numbers: if you use a 1024-bit RSA key, the modulus has size 128 bytes. Messages that can be encrypted must be no longer than 117 bytes. The encryption result is a sequence of 128 bytes.</p>\n<p>For signatures, the message that is to be signed is first hashed with a suitable hash function like SHA-256. Thus, arbitrarily long messages can be processed (SHA-256 has no practical limit on input length). The hash value is then padded, with a padding which looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>0x00 0x01 0xFF 0xFF ... 0xFF 0x00 ii... hh...\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <code>ii...</code> is a conventional header that designates the hash function, and <code>hh...</code> is the hash value. The number of 0xFF bytes is again adjusted so that the total length matches that of the modulus. The resulting sequence is again interpreted as in integer, and exponentiated modulo <em>N</em>, but this time the <em>private</em> exponent is used. Moreover, most RSA implementations actually optimize that operation by using the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chinese Remainder Theorem</a> through their knowledge of the factors of <em>N</em> (these factors are part of the private key).</p>\n<p>So, while both encryption and signature generation rely on some sort of padding followed by an exponentiation, they differ in significant ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>For encryption, the message is taken &quot;as is&quot; and is limited in length. For signature, the message is first hashed, and has no length limit.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The paddings differ. It is important for security that the padding used in encryption includes sufficiently many random bytes. It is equally important for security that the padding used in signatures includes sufficiently many non-random bytes. Less obviously, it is very important that the padding bytes occur &quot;on the left&quot; in the big-endian convention.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The exponentiations differ. For encryption, you use the public exponent, which is usually short (possibly down to e = 3, although the value e = 65537 is traditional)(as it happens, 65537 is used for no good reason at all, but hey, tradition is tradition). For signature generation, the private exponent is used, but the operation rarely use that exponent &quot;as is&quot;; in fact, two sub-exponentiations are done modulo <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> (the prime factors of <em>N</em>), for a total speed-up of about 4x.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In fact, the only really common point is that both RSA-encrypted messages and RSA signatures are integers modulo <em>N</em>, and are encoded with big-endian convention. Everything else differs. And, as I said earlier, you should not do signatures and encryption with the same key pairs anyway; both kinds of key pairs call for distinct management and lifecycles.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Some</em> implementations of signature generation/verification accept as input a pre-hashed value. The hash function is still an important part of the overall process. Even if a given piece of code accepts the hash value as input, the hash must still occur at some point.</p>\n<p><em>Some</em> implementations of the RSA signature verification algorithm actually on &quot;just&quot; the signature and the public key; instead of the simple boolean result (match/mismatch), they produce the hash value itself; the caller is then responsible for matching that hash value with the message that is purported to be signed. The ability to recover the hashed message from the signature+public key is a specificity of RSA (RSA is said to be a <em>signature algorithm with recovery</em>). Not all other signature algorithms can do that. And, again, it is important that the hash occurs; don't let it make you believe that you could do &quot;RSA signatures without hashing&quot;.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, RSA signatures used in SSL have relied on a slightly different procedure: the padding lacks the identifying header (the <code>ii...</code> in my notations), and the hash value is actually the concatenation of MD5 and SHA-1, both computed over the message that is to be signed. This is a remnant from a past where the PKCS#1 standard was not as firmly entrenched as it is today.</p>\n",

The mechanism will hash the data and combined with hash algorithm it encrypt using your private key. Verifier will use your public key to decrypt and check by comparing hash.</p>\n\n<p>Now think about some considerations\nQ: Why we are saying key exchange, not encryption/decryption?\nA: Encrypting and decrypting is expensive using RSA and for large data it is infeasible to do this. So, usually we do hybrid. Encrypt using session key and encrypt/wrap that session key to share. Usually session keys are symmetric block cipher algorithm's key.</p>\n\n<p>Q: Which one need more secrecy, Key exchange/Digital signature?\nA: Anybody can decrypt signature data.

As digital signature don't need extra security it works for same technique to unpadd for both key exchange and digital signature.</p>\n\n<p>Please try to keep in mind, Using algorithm is ok.

So, usually we do hybrid. Encrypt using session key and encrypt/wrap that session key to share.

A few examples:</p>\n\n<p>If my password is 'aaaaaaaa', then one valid way to view the entropy of the password would be 5.9 bits (entropy for single case-sensitive alphanumeric character) plus 3 bits (to indicate it repeated 3 times). </p>\n\n<p>If a service requires two passwords, and I set both to match each other, then I haven't significantly increased the amount of information to communicate the passwords over a single password, since 'Password123' and 'Password123 1' aren't that different in terms of entropy.</p>\n\n<p>If a service requires two passwords, and both are (separately) randomly generated, then I <em>have</em> doubled the entropy in the passwords (although it would make more sense to just have a single password with more strict minimum requirements).</p>\n",
            " <p>Actually, from your description, I'm not sure if you do understand how to calculate password entropy. The entropy of a password would be more correctly described as log(R) where R is a <em>randomness</em> metric, not a <em>complexity</em> metric.</p>\n\n<p>For example, this has nothing to do with using special characters. The password <code>Tr0ub4dor&amp;3</code> has 0 entropy because I took it from <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/936/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">somewhere</a>. On the other hand, the password <code>1101111110101000001011001110101110011111010100101111001110101011</code> has an entropy of 64 bits, because I just generated it by taking 8 random bytes and printing them in binary.</p>\n\n<p>The entropy of a password is the entropy from information theory. It measures the quantity of information that someone trying to break the password does not know. Unless specified otherwise, security people assume that the system has to defend against people with at least normal intelligence. Per <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kerckhoffs's principle</a>, we assume that the attacker knows the method by which the password was chosen. Thus the information content that the attacker lacks about the method is 0. What the attacker can't know, however, is the output of my random generator. Thus the entropy of a password is the information content provided by the random generator. Assuming a perfect random number generator and a password generation method that turns distinct RNG outputs into distinct passwords, this information content is equal to the amount of data read from the RNG.</p>\n\n<p>Password entropy is additive. If a system has two passwords such that you need to provide both to log in, then the entropy of the pair of passwords is the sum of the entropy of the two passwords. Note that there is an independence assumption here! If you can find out whether one password is correct without knowing the other, then the entropy of the two-password system is less than the sum of the entropy. (As an extreme case, consider a password of fixed length N bits: you could consider each bit of the password to be a separate mini-password; if you can test each bit independently then only 2N attempts are needed to break it instead of 2^N). Once again, this property comes from information theory: you can add the entropy of two separate information sources, but it doesn't make sense to add the entropy of two sources that overlap.</p>\n",
            " <p>Entropy in physics and in information science is just the logarithm (typically natural log in physics; base-2 log in computer science) of the number of equally likely possibilities, because it's generally easier to deal and think about with the logarithm of these exceptionally large number of possibilities than the possibilities directly.</p>\n\n<p>If I randomly generated 128-bit as my random AES-128 key (that I store somewhere), it's easy to see there are 2<sup>128</sup> = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 possible keys I could have used (2 equally-likely choices for each bit; and probabilities multiply).  When talking about informational complexity, it's just simpler to talk about the key having 128-bits of entropy than saying about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_large_numbers#Standard_dictionary_numbers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">340 x 10<sup>36</sup> or 340 undecillion (short scale)</a>, especially if you want to compare it against say a 256-bit key with 2<sup>256</sup>=115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,913,129,639,936 possibilities.</p>\n\n<p>Now if I hand you a random user's password, technically it's not possible to uniquely assign an entropy to it.</p>\n\n<p>You can only assign an entropy to a model of generating passwords.  So if you are asked to estimate an entropy for a password, your task is to assume the model that might have generated that password.  </p>\n\n<p>If I gave you a password like <code>P[rmDrds,r</code> you might assume I randomly chose 10 characters from a set of 95 printable ASCII characters and to brute-force you would have to go through 95<sup>10</sup> ~ 2<sup>65.7</sup> possibilities and it would have an entropy of 65.7 bits.  However, it's just a very weak password <code>OpenSesame</code> where I shifted my hands on the keyboard over to the right one letter (which is probably one of say 2^6 ~ 64 common ways to alter typing an easy to remember low-entropy password).  If you could find <code>OpenSesame</code> on a list of say the 1,000 (1000 ~ 2<sup>10</sup>) most common passwords then in fact the entropy of <code>P[rmDrds,r</code> is closer to 16-bits (possibilities of 2<sup>10</sup> x 2<sup>6</sup>), when the password generation is pick one of 64 common ways to obscure a password and then choose a password off a list of 1000 common passwords.  Thus after about 64,000 attempts a sophisticated brute forcer who tried this avenue of attack could arrive at <code>P[rmDrds,r</code>, so it's more accurate to estimate it's entropy as about 16 bits than 65.7 bits, which is 2<sup>65.7-16</sup> ~ 2<sup>49.7</sup> ~ 914 trillion times times easier to brute-force than the 65.7 bit password.</p>\n\n<p>Now, obviously some less-sophisticated brute force attacker might have ignored the possibility of shifting characters over on the keyboard one space to the left while going through common password lists. But to be safe you ignore dumb attackers and assume very sophisticated attacker has considered all of your methods of password generation (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kerckhoffs's principle</a> says avoid security by obscurity; assume the enemy has considered your secret technique among many other methods).  So when someone says you need a high-entropy password, your goal isn't a password that appears to be highly random (and some <a href=\"https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">simple password tester</a> labels it as high-entropy).  You want a random password that was built off of lots of random choices being input into your password generation procedure.  You should not pick meaningful words to you and make up a password for it with obscure tricks like shifting letters around or leetspeak substitutions.  For a strong password, you should rely on 80+ bits of non-human randomness being input into your procedure.  You should note that one bit of entropy in a password generation procedure is equivalent to a two-option decision (e.g., something that could be determined by a coin flip).</p>\n\n<p>And again, with very small likelihood you can randomly generate a password with a lot of random choices and it ends up a very weak password; e.g., it's technically possible that you randomly choose 12 characters and get <code>password1234</code> or <code>dddddddddddd</code>.  In practice, that's a possibility though it's unlikely to happen (e.g., if you use a procedure that generates an 90-bit password, the chance that it generated a password that also could have been generated with a simpler procedure with only 34-bits is 2<sup>34</sup>/2<sup>90</sup> = 1 in 2<sup>56</sup> which is roughly the odds of buying exactly two Mega Millions tickets in a row and winning the jackpot both times).</p>\n",
            " <p>The password's entropy is like the entropy of every source of information: it is -log_2 of the Bayesian probability of that exact password for the attacker.  As such, the entropy of a password is, strictly speaking, attacker-dependent, because it is the Bayesian probability for him, including all information he already possesses. </p>\n\n<p>The entropy of the password for you is zero, because the Bayesian probability of the right password is 1 for you: its universe consists of only one single password, because you know it.</p>\n\n<p>If you decided to take a uniformly randomly selected word out of a 4096-word dictionary, and the attacker knows this, then the password entropy is 12 bits.  If however, the attacker doesn't know which of the 256 possible dictionaries (with different words, let's say, because different languages) you have picked, and if he assigns equal probabilities to each of them, then your password will have 20 bits of entropy for him. </p>\n\n<p>If, on the other hand, he gives it 50% chance that you took it from the right dictionary, and he assigns the other 50%/255 to the other 255 dictionaries (in other words, he guessed the right dictionary with 50%), then your password will have only 13 bits of entropy for him.  Note that if he guessed the main dictionary wrong, then your password has actually 21 bits of entropy for him, because he only assigned 50%/255 to the right dictionary!\nIn other words, the entropy of a password is depending on what the attacker already estimates to know about your password.</p>\n\n<p>The only <em>absolutely safe</em> way to have a high-entropy password is using a true random number generator (based for instance, on the second law of thermodynamics, or quantum physics), where <em>physical</em> entropy is used to generate information entropy.  The point is that nobody has any better Bayesian estimator than the physically given entropy (or otherwise, the second law of thermodynamics would be violated: that's exactly what the second law is saying in fact).</p>\n\n<p>Cryptographic one-way trapdoor functions do not add entropy: in the best case, they conserve entropy.  If you pick a number from 1 to 32, and then you calculate SHA-256 or SHA-1 or just any funny combination of hash functions, you will have a thing that LOOKS like a very random password, but it will only have 5 bits of entropy if your picking of 1-32 was uniformly random: there are only 32 possible outcomes, no matter how many bits you have in your final password.</p>\n\n<p>Pseudo-random generators also do not add entropy: they obfuscate the entropy that is in the seed.  They are nothing else but a complicated sequence of hash functions applied to the seed.</p>\n",
            " <p>As others have said, it is not password entropy, it is <em>password generation entropy</em>: how hard is it to duplicate a given password given full knowledge of how it was created.</p>\n\n<p>To calculate the entropy, write down the process, step by step.  Then determine how many attempts it would take, to find a password generated by those steps.</p>\n\n<p>Password: 01012006</p>\n\n<p>Process: my child's birthday in mmddyyyy format.  365.25 per year, current maximim age of people and minimum age of successful child birth gives range of no more than 115 years.  115 x 365.25 = 42,004 attempts before you are sure to have found the password.</p>\n\n<p>Process: pick 8 random numbers using a 10 sided dice.  10^8 attempts before you are sure to have found the password.</p>\n\n<p>Same exact password, one is vastly easier to get and subject to out of band optimization (information not directly part of the process, but which limits the options). If I know the birthdate of your children the current max attempts is probably under a 1000 and as low as 1.</p>\n\n<p>As for whether it is additive: not exactly.  You only have one password generation algorithm, it just includes a step that was used elsewhere as a complete process for generating a password.</p>\n",
            " <p>The reason why password entropy typically looks like log\u2082(D) is that this is the Shannon entropy for an information source that has a uniform probability distribution for all the potential outcomes when the number of potential outcomes is D. In this context, outcomes means outcomes from a stochastic password-generating process.</p>\n\n<p>And as others here have pointed out, entropy is not a property of any individual password. Entropy is a property of an ensemble of passwords that is defined by a particular set of rules. However, if you don't care about being stringent, you can sometimes loosely infer what those rules are by inspecting an individual password, e.g. the presence of digits and uppercase letters loosely imply rules that specify a larger ensemble (with a uniform probability distribution) than when only lowercase letters are present.</p>\n\n<p>For an individual password there is a different measure called Kolmogorov Complexity that measures how many bits of information are necessary to produce that <em>particular</em> password from a predetermined algorithm. This is obviously a relative measure since it depends on the algorithm, but loosely speaking you can use the compressed length of the password as a proxy for Kolmogorov complexity.</p>\n",
            " <p>The password entropy is given by how long it would typically take an attacker, who knew your password generation scheme, to run through all the possible passwords it could generate.</p>\n\n<p>For instance I use a password generator that is basically dicewords. I use a cryptographically strong method to generate a random word, then use groups of 6 bits from that to choose from a dictionary of 64 english words of 3 letters (rat, cow, men ...), to make the password more human readable/usable/memorable.</p>\n\n<p>Although the apparent entropy (attacker doesn't know the method) of a character from the resulting password is roughly 5 or 6 bits (one character from 26 alpha or more alphanumeric) , the true entropy (attacker does have my program) is only 2, because of the knowledge that went into how it was generated.</p>\n\n<p>A strong password is arrived at simply by having sufficient number of characters.

When I think of why I should use a good password, I immediately think because some website's database is going to be compromised and the attacker is going to have a hash of my password with all the time in the world to brute-force it. So if you think in terms of that then it should convince you more on why a strong password is worth the effort. Unless an attacker has a specific reason to go after you, they probably aren't going to waste their time with a login form on a website, they are going for databases</p>\n\n<p>If you use a simple or short password then the hash might already have been cracked. Unless you are dealing with a persistent actor then attackers usually go for low hanging fruit, meaning if they have a database of hashes, they are going to crack all easy ones and get what they can and make a quick buck. This also reinforces the use of a password manager because if you reuse passwords across multiple accounts then you just made the attackers life easier and that is where password managers are extremely helpful.</p>\n",

This means trying to get the private key of the CA from the certificates it issued is no problem in practice, no matter how many certificates where issued. </p>\n\n<p>Still, (sub-)CA certificates will be renewed from time to time too because they were expired or because the signature algorithm used to sign the CA is deemed unsafe.</p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p>The way we create buckets in our org and ensure sane ACLs around it is by providing an automated tool (that internally uses Terraform) to provision an S3 bucket. So say when a user requests for a new bucket, named <code>testBucket</code> we create a bucket named <code>testBucket</code> and also create an IAM user by the name <code>testBucket-user</code>. The automation ensures that the <code>testBucket-user</code>'s policies are such that the only allowed actions to this user are :</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"s3:ListBucket\",\n\"s3:PutObject\",\n\"s3:GetObject\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and the only allowed resource on which the above actions are allowed is the <code>testBucket</code> bucket. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the automation also ensures that the automation puts bucket policies to ensure that the only actions allowed on it are the above 3 actions and only by the user <code>testBucket-user</code></p>\n\n<p>However, on demand (&amp; if business justified) we do make changes to the created bucket policies as and when needed. So recently there was one such requirement, where a certain bucket needed to have a folder in it that was meant to hold all publicly intended images. </p>\n\n<p>Now there were 2 options we had in order to provision the above requirement:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Modify the bucket policy to allow <code>principal:*</code> for the folder in the bucket thus allowing all objects in that folder in the bucket to be by default public. </li>\n<li>To modify and give <strong>PutObjectACL</strong> permissions to the IAM user that has access to that bucket and let the dev manage which objects in the folder can be or can not be public. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As the security team we were more convinced of the first option just because it looked more logical. The problem with the first option however was the fact that now any object (publicly intended or even otherwise) in this folder would be by default public. </p>\n\n<p>I wonder what does the community think here around it?

Buckets are freely created, and hence there's little value in keeping all private and public objects in a single bucket, as they're likely to have different encryption, storage, archival and lifecycle requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Publicly available images are unlikely to be access via the S3 API, and more likely via http, hence it's usually good practice to limit S3 access via Cloudfront, and limit all interaction to the bucket via http -- unless your requirement specifically states the bucket itself has to be public.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you really must, I'm more inclined to place a <code>principal:*</code> for the folder in question -- which is far easier detect and glance through. The bucket policy should only allow <code>s3:GetObject</code> for objects in this 'folder', as anything else would be bad. Also <code>s3:ListBucket</code> is applicable to the entire bucket and not just a folder in the bucket -- so beware.</p>\n\n<p><em>Remember, S3 doesn't have a filesystem per say, it just looks like a folder, but S3 has internally parsed the key of <code>folder/item</code> to look like an item in a folder.</em></p>\n"

Typically, wireless networks broadcast their name, and your PC \u201clistens\u201d for the name of the network that it wants to connect to. Because a hidden network doesn\u2019t broadcast, your PC can't find it, so the network has to find your PC. For this to happen, your PC must broadcast both the name of the network it's looking for and its own name. <strong>In this situation, other PCs \u201clistening\u201d for networks will know the name of your PC as well as the network you\u2019re connected to, which increases the risk of your PC being attacked.</strong> <sub>(emphasis added)</sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I had always believed that hidden wireless networks were actually safer than normal ones, because only those who already know of the network are able to connect to it, so an attacker wouldn't be able to connect to it to listen to your traffic.</p>\n\n<p>Are hidden networks actually more risky, as the paragraph says, and if so, what measures can be taken to help mitigate the risk?</p>\n\n<p>Also, I know that there are some countries where publicly broadcasting home networks are actually illegal, and hidden networks are the only option for wireless.  If broadcasting networks are safer, why are they illegal in some places?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

Because of that, when you're not connected to the network, you'll be advertising that you're trying to connect to network X. If someone is listening to these signals, they can easily find out that you have a network called X to which your computer is attempting to connect.</p>\n\n<p>As for the legal issue, I've actually heard that in some jurisdiction it's illegal to leave your network <em>open</em>, but I have never really heard that you have to hide it.</p>\n",

Most companies are trying to make it easier for people by using the same domain.</p>\n<p>What makes an email source <em>legitimate</em> is the intent of the company. And if a company makes that intent unclear, it creates confusion. People end up contacting the company to confirm that the email is legitimate.

Of course, a bad actor can also take over an existing host with a direct attack.</p>\n<p>The second is cousin domains, aka look-alike domains, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">homograph attacks</a> (like paypa1.com or p\u00e2ypal.com) or <a href=\"http://astrolavos.gatech.edu/2017/08/28/Combosquatting/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">combosquats</a> (like paypal-support.com) or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelganger_domain\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">doppelgangers</a> (like wwwpaypal.com) or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typosquatting\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">typosquats</a> (like papyal.com).</p>\n<p>In this case, you gave <code>f.change.org</code> as &quot;slightly different from&quot; <code>change.org</code>. That's a subdomain unless you've got a non-ASCII character hiding in there (which would be an IDN homograph attack), so it's either legitimately from change.org or it's hijacked in some manner like domain shadowing.</p>\n<p>I bet if you check the email, it passes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DMARC</a>, which will prove that it was sent by change.org (whose DMARC record does not specify <code>aspf:s</code> or <code>adkim:s</code> and therefore has relaxed alignment, meaning f.change.org matches change.org as noted in <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7489\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">RFC 7489</a>.</p>\n",
        "rejected_target": " <p>First, let's define something: <code>change.org</code> is a domain name. <code>example.com</code> is a domain name. <code>something.example.com</code> is a subdomain (<code>something</code>) under a domain name. You can think of it like an address where you say the house number, then the street, then the city, then the country. And sometimes you can omit some details from the address, so not every domain needs a subdomain.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Emails from completely different domains could also be legitimate emails. There are some companies that have a domain just for email and one for the website domain.</p>\n<p>Some even use separate companies to send emails.</p>\n<p>Both of these practices can make it very difficult for people to determine which email is legitimate and which is fake. Most companies are trying to make it easier for people by using the same domain.</p>\n<p>What makes an email source <em>legitimate</em> is the intent of the company. And if a company makes that intent unclear, it creates confusion. People end up contacting the company to confirm that the email is legitimate. (and if you do, ask the company to fix the confusion they created).</p>\n<p>This email, however, isn't really doing anything strange. The subdomain name is from the same domain that no one else shares. So,</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>www.change.org</code></li>\n<li><code>mail.change.org</code></li>\n<li><code>f.change.org</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>would all be the same &quot;place&quot;. This gets tricky, however, if the domain is shared with lots of people, but for Change.org, it's just them.</p>\n"

            " <p>It may be because they recently made deals to start bundling malware with their downloads, and one of their developers has given people real bad attitude, claiming things from it's not malware to it's not his decision to quips like you can choose not to install it once you first install the malware laden installer.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=30240\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=30240</a></p>\n\n<p>It could be the passwords stored in plain text, but I really doubt that's so much an issue to the security crowd as bundling malware in the installer, adding options that nuke all your passwords poorly in the quickconnect bar, and just the recently poor attitude towards people trying to complain about these recent-ish changes.  The attitude seems to be that you can always opt out of the malware install options if you know what your doing, once you download the malware laden installer.</p>\n",
            " <p>I think one of the main reason people advise to move away from Filezilla is clearly the fact passwords are stored as plain text and thus, easilly stolen.\nFilezilla bad reputation began some years ago when some malwares began to target specifically Filezilla. \nUsing critical flaws in third party softwares (namely flash and acrobat reader) these malwares were able to steal the XML passowrd file Filezilla uses to store the passwords.\nMost of the time, these malwares were eradicated and cleaned in a few seconds, but the data was stolen.\nThese stolen credential files were then handled in a very complicated bot zombie network which connected to each and every ftp contained in the file, scanned it then propagated malware in every index.html/php file found on these FTP. In less than 2 hours, all the ftp websites stored in filezilla were infected.\nAt the time, the process has been very well documented by some victim webmasters.</p>\n\n<p>Probably thousands of webmasters, tens of thousands of websites, were infected because of this. Many many complained about the fact the passwords were not encrypted.</p>\n\n<p>The second reason people advise to move away from Filezilla is the reaction of the developper team : instead of adding this feature, they just refused every argument, either sending back the responsibility to badly secured systems or pretending that encrypting passwords would not change anything, that it was system's responsibility to secure data.</p>\n\n<p>So for now, if you still want to use Filezilla (which is a good ftp client) you really should consider disabling all password storing options and using a third party tool like Keepass. It's a bit of a pain in the <em>*</em> but it's safer. \nYou may even find bonus advantages with Keepass because you'll have a tool to centralize cross-protocol credentials in a safer way</p>\n",
            " <p>FileZilla does come with malware now and the developers are aware and probably getting money from it.</p>\n\n<p>Search for FileZilla Premieropinion in Google or read any of the MANY threads on Filezilla's forum:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=31967&amp;start=30\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=31967&amp;start=30</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=30240\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=30240</a></p>\n\n<p>The developer keeps saying that you have the option to opt-out but the installer is CLEARLY designed to misguide people. I work on the tech industry (so I am generally aware of security concerns) and I got fooled, like countless others. It was also my first experience of malware with Macs.</p>\n\n<p>I will never use FileZilla again. Even if you can \"opt-out\" this is clearly designed to fool the users and worst of all the developer is just copy pasting a dishonest reply on FileZilla's forums. So even if the software might still work, I will never accept the attitude of the developer. The issue is not trying to monetize your work. The issue is trying to fool your users.</p>\n",

But is this change of policy statement followed by retrieving Windows 10 from the market and replacing it by a new one? Of course not.</p>\n<p>Note that the last paragraph I quoted is only still available in external websites including famous newspapers by the start of this August (which thing means after Microsoft started already to sell its Windows 10), but we do not find this paragraph anymore in the updated version of the privacy policy statement anymore. So Microsoft removed it already.</p>\n<p>Update:</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-privacy-statement\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Windows 10 feedback, diagnostics, and privacy: FAQ</a> (shipped version of Windows 10, NOT Pre-Release Preview), we can also  read regarding <strong>Diagnostics Tracking Service</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As you use Windows, we collect performance and usage information that\nhelps us identify and troubleshoot problems as well as improve our\nproducts and services. We recommend that you select <strong>Full</strong> for this\nsetting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Basic</strong> information is data that is vital to the operation of Windows. This data helps keep Windows and apps running properly by\nletting Microsoft know the capabilities of your device, what is\ninstalled, and whether Windows is operating correctly. This option\nalso turns on basic error reporting back to Microsoft. If you select\nthis option, we\u2019ll be able to provide updates to Windows (through\nWindows Update, including malicious software protection by the\nMalicious Software Removal Tool), but some apps and features may not\nwork correctly or at all.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Enhanced</strong> data includes all Basic data plus data about how you use Windows, such as how frequently or how long you use certain features\nor apps and which apps you use most often. This option also lets us\ncollect enhanced diagnostic information, such as the memory state of\nyour device when a system or app crash occurs, as well as measure\nreliability of devices, the operating system, and apps. If you select\nthis option, we\u2019ll be able to provide you with an enhanced and\npersonalized Windows experience.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Full</strong> data includes all Basic and Enhanced data, and also turns on advanced diagnostic features that collect additional data from your\ndevice, such as system files or memory snapshots, which may\nunintentionally include parts of a document you were working on when a\nproblem occurred. This information helps us further troubleshoot and\nfix problems. If an error report contains personal data, we won\u2019t use\nthat information to identify, contact, or target advertising to you.\nThis is the recommended option for the best Windows experience and the\nmost effective troubleshooting.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that only on Enterprise Edition one can turn <em><strong>Diagnostics Tracking Service</strong></em> off totally.</p>\n<p>Diagnostics Tracking Service available in Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1), and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and Windows 10. The quoted paragraphs concern the Diagnostics Tracking Service mechanism in which other modules, apart from Telemetry, are included.</p>\n<p>Diagnostics Tracking Service consists in these files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>telemetry.asm-windowsdefault.json</li>\n<li>diagtrack.dll</li>\n<li>utc.app.json</li>\n<li>utcresources.dll</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that the answer below claiming that nothing private is collected by Windows 10 as a qualified user may listen to the traffic of his Windows operating system is wrong. It is impossible to know what Windows collects and sends permanently. Windows does not stop sending  information on his/her behalf as this study shows: Even when told not to, Windows 10 just can\u2019t stop talking to Microsoft. But still what the official documentation describes is not very good for the user such as when Windows takes <em>system files or <strong>MEMORY SNAPSHOTS</strong>, which may unintentionally include <strong>PARTS OF A DOCUMENT YOU WERE WORKING ON</strong> on when a problem occurred</em> (From: <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/98172/what-are-the-privacy-and-security-implications-of-windows-telemetry\">What are the privacy and security implications of Windows Telemetry</a>)</p>\n",
            " <p>It's worth noting that your first link is in relation to the Windows Insider program. The Windows Insider program provides you with pre-release software that does call home with usage details and other information. This is something that you agree to by installing the Windows Insider preview - if you don't like it, you don't have to install it, it's completely your choice.</p>\n\n<p>The EULA for the released version of Windows 10 doesn't include this section and there is no evidence that this information is being collected (which of course could just mean they're better at hiding it).</p>\n\n<p>The second link that you've provided is regarding the Family functionality, this is functionality that has to be enabled in order for it to work and collects application usage statistics and browsing history. In the instance linked in the article, it's perfectly possible that this functionality was enabled in Windows 8 and expanded upon when the upgrade to Windows 10 occurred. On my clean install I don't have this going on so this isn't enabled by default and has to be something that you opt into - again, when you opt into something like this you're given an agreement to agree with stating that additional information will be collected. If the information wasn't collected, functionality like this simply couldn't work.</p>\n\n<p>Windows 10 has a large number of privacy settings - many of these are on by default but they're easy enough to disable by opening up the Settings app and working your way through the Privacy settings. This covers a large variety of options from your unique advertising identifier, which is shared across various applications to allow Microsoft to track your use of the apps and show you targeted ads, to Bing search in the start menu, which will send your search queries to Microsoft Bing. This also includes many settings from older versions of Windows, such as the SmartScreen filter, which sends URLs to Microsoft for validation.</p>\n\n<p>Windows 10 also contains Cortana, with Cortana enabled, you're asking Microsoft to provide you a personal assistant and this will include sending information about your activities (including applications you run, GPS locations, browsing history) back and forth between your machine and Microsoft. This can include things like your handwriting and what your voice sounds like, but these can be disabled individually within Speech, inking &amp; typing within Privacy settings. Cortana isn't unique in this behavior. (How do you think Google Now and Siri work?)</p>\n\n<p>If you sign into Windows 10 with a Microsoft account, authentication is handled via Microsoft as well. This will also provide you with the functionality to synchronize your desktop settings, passwords, web browser settings and more between multiple devices running Windows 10. If these options are enabled then this is additional information that is synchronized to Microsoft's servers. Each of the individual sync settings can be toggled in the Settings app under Accounts > Sync your settings, or you can simply not log in with a Microsoft account and use a local account. If you're using Windows 10 Home edition, you will need to use a Microsoft account in order to enable BitLocker, and your recovery key will be uploaded to Microsoft's servers. This restriction does not apply to Windows 10 Pro or higher.</p>\n\n<p>With the \"Sample submission\" option for Windows Defender enabled, Windows Defender will send your files off to Microsoft - for example if you had some kind of confidential document with a macro in it that Windows Defender identified as a threat, with the  option enabled, this file would be submitted to Microsoft for analysis.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/even-when-told-not-to-windows-10-just-cant-stop-talking-to-microsoft/\">There are reports that even with all of the above functionality disabled some information is being passed back and forth to Microsoft</a> (Arcs Technica), and Microsoft's response on this matter is as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As part of delivering Windows 10 as a service, updates may be delivered to provide ongoing new features to Bing search, such as new visual layouts, styles and search code. No query or search usage data is sent to Microsoft, in accordance with the customer's chosen privacy settings. This also applies to searching offline for items such as apps, files and settings on the device.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><sup>It's worth noting that Arcs Technica states this statement from Microsoft is consistent with their findings</sup></p>\n\n<p>Basically, as part of the Windows Feedback and error reporting, diagnostic data is reported back to Microsoft, this can only be disabled in the Enterprise and Server editions of Windows 10 through the use of group policy editor but can only be set to a \"basic\" mode on Home and Pro editions which \"limits the amount of data sent\". This can be set in the Settings app under Feedback &amp; Diagnostics. </p>\n\n<p>Microsoft have never hidden the fact that Windows 10 is supposed to be the last major release and that future functionality will be provided as automatic updates. Any such system will require information to be passed to Microsoft to work. Ultimately, there are a lot of components in Windows that will individually and collectively synchronize their status with their online counterparts and this will result in internet traffic. </p>\n",

            " <p>Your question is subject to some subtleties. Fasten your seat belt, I am going to be verbose.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Digital Medium</strong></h2>\n\n<p>You want a \"digital\" medium. What is that <em>exactly</em> ? In a hard disk, a bit is written by changing the orientation of some magnetic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dipoles</a>, created by the \"movement\" (inasmuch as it can be defined as per quantum mechanics) of electrons in some of the atoms of the disk platter. Roughly speaking, each atom has a natural orientation, and the bit is stored by changing this orientation, i.e. \"rotating\" the atom. So there is some amount of \"physical movement\" in it. That's also true with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">flash memory</a>: data is stored by accumulating \"charges\" in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">semiconductor substrate</a>; the charge corresponds to the \"physical\" movement of electrons (they hop between \"bands\" -- the kind-of orbital trajectories of electrons around atom kernels).</p>\n\n<p>Now consider a sheet of some material in which you engrave some data; there again, that's just \"moving around\" some of the atoms of the material, so it is not <em>qualitatively</em> distinct from magnetic storage. You can make a distinction based on the amount of matter which is moved for a single bit, but this involves an arbitrary threshold.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engraving\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Engraving</a> has a remarkable record of long-term reliability for information storage. Consider this marvelous extract from the <a href=\"http://www.schoyencollection.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sch\u00f8yen collection</a>:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9SPwU.jpg\" alt=\"MS 3029 - Gift from the high and mighty of Adab to the high priestess, on the occasion of her election to the temple (Sumer, 26th century BC)\"></p>\n\n<p>This specific data file has been stored for more than 4500 <em>years</em>, in an area which has been scourged by countless wars in between. Empires have waxed and waned, and the soil soaked by the blood of warriors. Yet the information remained and was not lost; and, even better, it was stored at <strong>no marginal cost at all</strong>. As can be seen on the picture above, the medium would be good for a few more millenia at least. Data integrity is more threatened by, let's say, \"encoding problems\" (although that specific example could be translated nonetheless).</p>\n\n<p>From the wording of your question, I assume that you would declare such engraving as \"not digital\" and reject it. Now, have a look at this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FX8PO.jpg\" alt=\"Microscoping view of the surface of a CD\"></p>\n\n<p>This is a close-up view of the surface of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Compact Disc</a>, of the \"pressed\" variety (i.e. not a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-R\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CD-R</a>). The bits are encoding by embossing, the dual operation of engraving; a big press is involved in the process. A CD-R does not use embossing; rather, the optical properties of a dye layer are modified with a laser, so a CD-R is more similar to printing on paper (in particular <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_printer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">thermal printers</a> as are common in payment terminals).</p>\n\n<p>A CD is definitely \"digital\". However, it is not qualitatively distinct from the work of a Sumerian scribe on a stone slab. To declare the latter \"not digital\", you have to enforce a totally arbitrary threshold, which, as such, can be challenged.</p>\n\n<p>You might want to make a distinction based on how the data can be read back into a computer, on the basis that a CD goes into a reader which outputs zeroes and ones on a wire. However, the slab picture above which you saw went to your computer over wires as zeroes and ones, so, there again, the distinction is subject to an arbitrary threshold. As a more striking example, consider <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">QR codes</a> like this one:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bk9q2.png\" alt=\"QR code for Wikipedia (mobile version of the main English page)\"></p>\n\n<p>Now, a QR code printed on a sheet of paper, or engraved on a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">marble slab</a> (to be read with tangential lighting, so as to shadow the pits), is that digital or not ?</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Magnetism and EMP</strong></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magnetism</a> is a property of some materials. Magnetism is convenient for computerized data storage, because of the achievable high density, low latency, and possibility of multiple rewrites. However, this last property is also the bane of long-term storage: stored data can be affected by external magnetic sources, and is subject to gradual leakage. Even reading implies \"grabbing\" a bit of energy from the medium, thus weakening the data storage. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magneto-optical_drive\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magneto-optical drives</a> fare a bit better:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The medium magnetism can be altered only at high temperatures; at room temperature, it is \"fixed\".</li>\n<li>Reading can be done optically (because the medium optical qualities are modified by the magnetic orientation which was forced upon it when it was last heated), thus leaving the magnetic field \"alone\".</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Although manufacturers of magneto-optical drives claim reliable storage for long durations (decades, up to a century or two), this heavily depends on environmental conditions, and has never been tested \"in full size\" since the technology itself is not that old.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, magnetic storage, whether magneto-optical or not, can be disrupted by applying a huge amount of magnetism in one go, something known as an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Electromagnetic Pulse</strong></a>. This is the electromagnetic equivalent of a full stadium of beer-powered sport fans bellowing simultaneously (this has been used by some movie directors to obtain sound effects which are hard to simulate in a lab, resulting for instance in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgcFAsXAGiQ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this scene</a> -- a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">cricket</a> stadium was involved). The method of choice for generating big EMP is through nuclear weapons: nuclear fission and fusion emit huge amounts of high energy gamma rays, which, by colliding with electrons, create the EMP. EMP can also be generated with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosively_pumped_flux_compression_generator\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">non-nuclear devices</a>, albeit with a much lower energy.</p>\n\n<p>Hollywood, in its everlasting educational mission, has depicted a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_wlTsLIPxE\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">non-nuclear EMP</a> in which the generating device looks like a jukebox. There has been some allowance for artistic license, though: a non-nuclear EMP works by rapid compression of a conductor in a magnetic field, where \"rapid\" means \"high explosives\". While the EMP effect has some military applications in specific situations (especially disabling onboard electronics in missiles, without needing to actually hit the missile with another missile), the common wisdom is that the explosives are more a general threat than the EMP itself. Would-be terrorists would not care about electromagnetism; they would just blow up things with the explosives alone.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Faraday cage</a> is effective against EMP proper; however, it does not block gamma rays and neutrons from a nuclear explosion, so gamma rays may enter the cage and generate a local pulse by interacting with the magnetic storage medium itself. The best protection for magnetic storage devices against a nuclear event is a deep underground bunker (it is also efficient for protecting human operators). That's what they do for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NORAD\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">NORAD</a>: the headquarters are buried under a mountain.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Security: Threats and Goals</strong></h2>\n\n<p>There are two sides to data security:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Protection against destruction:</strong> we want to be able to read the data back later on, possibly after many decades. An attacker may want to prevent us from doing that.</li>\n<li><strong>Protection against data theft:</strong> we do <em>not</em> want an attacker to be able to access the data.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These two goals are partially opposite to each other. The best protection against destruction is duplication; if you have a dozen copies of the data scattered over five continents, then the attacker will have a hard time obliterating them all (even <a href=\"http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Horcrux\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Harry Potter</a> could not do it in less than seven books). However, the more physical copies there are, the harder it is to protect them all against illicit copying. To some extent, <em>theft</em> is just another copy, so theft protects against destruction...</p>\n\n<p>The situation is substantially different, depending on when and how you want to be able to access the stored data (data storage makes sense only if you plan to access the data at some point, even conditionally). If you just want long-term storage as a backup in case of a large-scale disaster, then you can use a non-networked storage facility, thereby removing all threats related to \"hacking\". Thus, protection against theft becomes a matter of physical security: store the data in a bunker, enlist guardians with (as @Lucas suggests) fierce dogs.</p>\n\n<p>Guardians and dogs are a worry, though, because:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>There are costs: you must feed them, entertain them, see to their general well-being and health, but in the same time subject them to enough stress and well-dosed misery so that they remain sharp and mean killing machines. And you must do that for the dogs, too.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bribery is a problem. Each biological entity you allow around the premises is yet another target for subversion. Elaborate cross-spying schemes, with rewards on ratting out, can mitigate the issue, but involve even higher costs, and are considered to be \"toxic to the workplace\".</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The storage medium can trigger the same kind of issue. If you use magnetic storage such as hard disks, then you must regularly (say, on a yearly basis) power the drives, and replace the units which fail to go live (invariably, some will fail to power up). This entails some redundancy (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">error correcting codes</a> and variants, such as what is used in some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">RAID arrays</a>) and, you get it, operators. Those pesky humans tend to have external lives, through which they can be controlled by adverse parties (give a man one million dollar, or kidnap his mother, and see if he keeps on refusing something as simple as pinching a hard disk).</p>\n\n<p>If the facility does not need regular intervention, then you can, to some extent, use discretion as a substitute. For instance, consider the external lookout of the tomb of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tutankhamun</a> (actually, a view from the Valley of the Kings, in Egypt, at a place where archeologists of the last two centuries have not yet defaced the landscape with their excavations):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UkY0i.jpg\" alt=\"View from the Valley of the Kings, Egypt\"></p>\n\n<p>and compare that to the tomb of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khufu\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Khufu</a>, of, let's say, questionable inconspicuousness:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ztORz.jpg\" alt=\"The Great Pyramid of Giza\"></p>\n\n<p>Now guess which one was <em>not</em> robbed in more than three thousand years ?</p>\n\n<p>That's \"Security through Obscurity\" and it is known to be unreliable (e.g. see the plot of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_a_Few_Dollars_More\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">For a Few Dollars More</a>), but \"unreliable\" does not mean that it never works...</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Encryption</strong></h2>\n\n<p>It is time to flourish our secret weapon: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">encryption</a>. Encryption does not <em>create</em> secrecy; however, it <em>concentrates</em> secrecy. You have a key; it is a sequence of bits which have been generated with as much randomness as is practical (e.g. with coin flips, or sufficiently unbiased dice). Using the key, you can transform the data, even huge amounts of data, into a big heap of meaningless junk of roughly the same size of the original data; <em>but</em>, knowing the key, you can reverse the operation and recover your precious data.</p>\n\n<p>A cryptographic key for symmetric encryption (\"symmetric\" means that the same key is used for encrypting and for decrypting) needs not be long; it just has to be long enough to thwart exhaustive search (i.e. it would be way too expensive, or even downright impossible with energetic resources available on Earth, to try out any substantial part of the set of possible key values). <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/a/6149/655\">128 bits are enough</a>, but, in order to accommodate inflexible administrative regulations and quiet the qualms of managers who read too many science-fiction books, you might want to pump the key size up to 256 bits\n(don't believe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Fortress\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dan Brown</a>: exhaustive search is <em>not</em> a ultimately workable attack strategy, even if the attack machine is expensive; the scientific basis for this novel is no better than the quality of writing or the plausibility of the characters). As for the encryption algorithm, there is no guarantee that any specific algorithm will keep up its security promises for the next century, but there are good looking candidates which have sustained cryptanalytic advances for more than a decade, and that's not for lack of trying. I am of course speaking about the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">AES</a>, which seems to be quite secure, and, furthermore, is Approved by governmental bodies throughout the World. AES <em>might</em> not ultimately protect your data, but it is the best that can be offered right now, and its security is plausible enough that you can get insurance against possible attacks at reasonable costs.</p>\n\n<p>The secrecy concentration works like this: if the data you store is encrypted, then you no longer have to worry about theft of the data itself. You can store your gigabytes on any number of hard disks, copied and stored over dozens of remote places so that local disasters and \"Acts of God\" do not destroy it. Hundreds of underpaid henchmen may oversee the regular maintenance operations, with no bribery issue. You <em>still</em> need to take steps to guarantee the secrecy of the key, but the key is very small, so that's much easier.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>The Solution</strong></h2>\n\n<p>For long-term storage, I thus recommend the following scheme:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Encrypt the data, with AES and a 128-bit key (or 256-bit key if you need to woo investors).</li>\n<li>Store the encrypted data on hard disks or pressed CD (the former have more capacity, the latter require much less maintenance), and put these in guarded bunkers in geographical locations which are far away from each other (preferably, in distinct countries over several continents).</li>\n<li>Make a few copies of the key by engraving it on stone slabs (marble is classical; avoid limestone, which might lack durability in humid conditions; the Distinguished Customer will want to engrave on diamonds). Put the slabs in the safes of a few banks (do <em>not</em> conceal them in jewelry worn by your mistress -- that's the way of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Say_Never_Again\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">James Bond villains</a> and it does not work well, for long-term secrecy).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For extra security, split the key into parts with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shamir's Secret Sharing</a>, so that plundering one bank does not endanger the secrecy of the key.</p>\n\n<p>The trick, of course, is to make attacks more expensive than what the data is worth. If destroying or stealing your data involves a wide-scale nuclear war or a worldwide <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">meteorite strike</a>, then chances are that <em>your</em> data will be quite irrelevant in such conditions, and nobody will bother resorting to such drastic measures just to get at it.</p>\n",
            " <p>I'd recommend taking the data, place on a hard drive take out from the PC, encrypt the hard drive maybe using something like Bitlocker or whatever your prefer then place the non-connected hard drive in a nice safe, with a magnetic material to try and reroute the magnetic current re-directing it away protecting the hard drives. Pretty much as safe as it's going to get. </p>\n\n<p>So To Summarize:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>EMP isn't really a problem. It's quite unrealistic to be attacked with a EMP is you have a basement maybe keep the safe there away and well protected and you should be good as well as my suggestion for magnetic protection should help.</li>\n<li>Magnets protected my a current to reroute magnetic current away from the hard drives.</li>\n<li>Hackers can't attack as it would be completely unconnected offline.</li>\n<li>Thieves couldn't get into the safe as it would be protected as well as if they did the hard drives would be encrypted.</li>\n</ul>\n",
            " <p>First, use optical storage like a CD, could stand against EMP attacks. Provided you have a CD-ROM drive that also survives an EMP Attack.</p>\n\n<p>Encrypt your data with highest possible key length. Brute force or advanced cracking can eventually decrypt your data but is your data worth the cost to decrypt it? For example, exam questions, if a hacker takes 5 days to decrypt it and the exam will be published on the third day after encryption, what use is it to the hacker? </p>\n\n<p>Remember not all data are worth protecting viciously. </p>\n\n<p>Information security is not just about technology, it's about thought process.</p>\n\n<p>Always make multiple backup copies of your data to prevent hardware failure, corrupted data or ransomware.</p>\n"

EMP can also be generated with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosively_pumped_flux_compression_generator\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">non-nuclear devices</a>, albeit with a much lower energy.</p>\n\n<p>Hollywood, in its everlasting educational mission, has depicted a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_wlTsLIPxE\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">non-nuclear EMP</a> in which the generating device looks like a jukebox. There has been some allowance for artistic license, though: a non-nuclear EMP works by rapid compression of a conductor in a magnetic field, where \"rapid\" means \"high explosives\". While the EMP effect has some military applications in specific situations (especially disabling onboard electronics in missiles, without needing to actually hit the missile with another missile), the common wisdom is that the explosives are more a general threat than the EMP itself. Would-be terrorists would not care about electromagnetism; they would just blow up things with the explosives alone.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Faraday cage</a> is effective against EMP proper; however, it does not block gamma rays and neutrons from a nuclear explosion, so gamma rays may enter the cage and generate a local pulse by interacting with the magnetic storage medium itself. The best protection for magnetic storage devices against a nuclear event is a deep underground bunker (it is also efficient for protecting human operators). That's what they do for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NORAD\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">NORAD</a>: the headquarters are buried under a mountain.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Security: Threats and Goals</strong></h2>\n\n<p>There are two sides to data security:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Protection against destruction:</strong> we want to be able to read the data back later on, possibly after many decades. An attacker may want to prevent us from doing that.</li>\n<li><strong>Protection against data theft:</strong> we do <em>not</em> want an attacker to be able to access the data.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These two goals are partially opposite to each other. The best protection against destruction is duplication; if you have a dozen copies of the data scattered over five continents, then the attacker will have a hard time obliterating them all (even <a href=\"http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Horcrux\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Harry Potter</a> could not do it in less than seven books). However, the more physical copies there are, the harder it is to protect them all against illicit copying. To some extent, <em>theft</em> is just another copy, so theft protects against destruction...</p>\n\n<p>The situation is substantially different, depending on when and how you want to be able to access the stored data (data storage makes sense only if you plan to access the data at some point, even conditionally). If you just want long-term storage as a backup in case of a large-scale disaster, then you can use a non-networked storage facility, thereby removing all threats related to \"hacking\". Thus, protection against theft becomes a matter of physical security: store the data in a bunker, enlist guardians with (as @Lucas suggests) fierce dogs.</p>\n\n<p>Guardians and dogs are a worry, though, because:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>There are costs: you must feed them, entertain them, see to their general well-being and health, but in the same time subject them to enough stress and well-dosed misery so that they remain sharp and mean killing machines. And you must do that for the dogs, too.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bribery is a problem. Each biological entity you allow around the premises is yet another target for subversion. Elaborate cross-spying schemes, with rewards on ratting out, can mitigate the issue, but involve even higher costs, and are considered to be \"toxic to the workplace\".</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The storage medium can trigger the same kind of issue. If you use magnetic storage such as hard disks, then you must regularly (say, on a yearly basis) power the drives, and replace the units which fail to go live (invariably, some will fail to power up). This entails some redundancy (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">error correcting codes</a> and variants, such as what is used in some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">RAID arrays</a>) and, you get it, operators. Those pesky humans tend to have external lives, through which they can be controlled by adverse parties (give a man one million dollar, or kidnap his mother, and see if he keeps on refusing something as simple as pinching a hard disk).</p>\n\n<p>If the facility does not need regular intervention, then you can, to some extent, use discretion as a substitute. For instance, consider the external lookout of the tomb of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tutankhamun</a> (actually, a view from the Valley of the Kings, in Egypt, at a place where archeologists of the last two centuries have not yet defaced the landscape with their excavations):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UkY0i.jpg\" alt=\"View from the Valley of the Kings, Egypt\"></p>\n\n<p>and compare that to the tomb of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khufu\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Khufu</a>, of, let's say, questionable inconspicuousness:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ztORz.jpg\" alt=\"The Great Pyramid of Giza\"></p>\n\n<p>Now guess which one was <em>not</em> robbed in more than three thousand years ?</p>\n\n<p>That's \"Security through Obscurity\" and it is known to be unreliable (e.g. see the plot of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_a_Few_Dollars_More\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">For a Few Dollars More</a>), but \"unreliable\" does not mean that it never works...</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Encryption</strong></h2>\n\n<p>It is time to flourish our secret weapon: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">encryption</a>. Encryption does not <em>create</em> secrecy; however, it <em>concentrates</em> secrecy. You have a key; it is a sequence of bits which have been generated with as much randomness as is practical (e.g. with coin flips, or sufficiently unbiased dice). Using the key, you can transform the data, even huge amounts of data, into a big heap of meaningless junk of roughly the same size of the original data; <em>but</em>, knowing the key, you can reverse the operation and recover your precious data.</p>\n\n<p>A cryptographic key for symmetric encryption (\"symmetric\" means that the same key is used for encrypting and for decrypting) needs not be long; it just has to be long enough to thwart exhaustive search (i.e. it would be way too expensive, or even downright impossible with energetic resources available on Earth, to try out any substantial part of the set of possible key values). <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/a/6149/655\">128 bits are enough</a>, but, in order to accommodate inflexible administrative regulations and quiet the qualms of managers who read too many science-fiction books, you might want to pump the key size up to 256 bits\n(don't believe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Fortress\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dan Brown</a>: exhaustive search is <em>not</em> a ultimately workable attack strategy, even if the attack machine is expensive; the scientific basis for this novel is no better than the quality of writing or the plausibility of the characters). As for the encryption algorithm, there is no guarantee that any specific algorithm will keep up its security promises for the next century, but there are good looking candidates which have sustained cryptanalytic advances for more than a decade, and that's not for lack of trying. I am of course speaking about the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">AES</a>, which seems to be quite secure, and, furthermore, is Approved by governmental bodies throughout the World. AES <em>might</em> not ultimately protect your data, but it is the best that can be offered right now, and its security is plausible enough that you can get insurance against possible attacks at reasonable costs.</p>\n\n<p>The secrecy concentration works like this: if the data you store is encrypted, then you no longer have to worry about theft of the data itself. You can store your gigabytes on any number of hard disks, copied and stored over dozens of remote places so that local disasters and \"Acts of God\" do not destroy it. Hundreds of underpaid henchmen may oversee the regular maintenance operations, with no bribery issue. You <em>still</em> need to take steps to guarantee the secrecy of the key, but the key is very small, so that's much easier.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>The Solution</strong></h2>\n\n<p>For long-term storage, I thus recommend the following scheme:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Encrypt the data, with AES and a 128-bit key (or 256-bit key if you need to woo investors).</li>\n<li>Store the encrypted data on hard disks or pressed CD (the former have more capacity, the latter require much less maintenance), and put these in guarded bunkers in geographical locations which are far away from each other (preferably, in distinct countries over several continents).</li>\n<li>Make a few copies of the key by engraving it on stone slabs (marble is classical; avoid limestone, which might lack durability in humid conditions; the Distinguished Customer will want to engrave on diamonds). Put the slabs in the safes of a few banks (do <em>not</em> conceal them in jewelry worn by your mistress -- that's the way of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Say_Never_Again\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">James Bond villains</a> and it does not work well, for long-term secrecy).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For extra security, split the key into parts with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shamir's Secret Sharing</a>, so that plundering one bank does not endanger the secrecy of the key.</p>\n\n<p>The trick, of course, is to make attacks more expensive than what the data is worth. If destroying or stealing your data involves a wide-scale nuclear war or a worldwide <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">meteorite strike</a>, then chances are that <em>your</em> data will be quite irrelevant in such conditions, and nobody will bother resorting to such drastic measures just to get at it.</p>\n",
        "rejected_target": " <p>I'd recommend taking the data, place on a hard drive take out from the PC, encrypt the hard drive maybe using something like Bitlocker or whatever your prefer then place the non-connected hard drive in a nice safe, with a magnetic material to try and reroute the magnetic current re-directing it away protecting the hard drives. Pretty much as safe as it's going to get. </p>\n\n<p>So To Summarize:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>EMP isn't really a problem. It's quite unrealistic to be attacked with a EMP is you have a basement maybe keep the safe there away and well protected and you should be good as well as my suggestion for magnetic protection should help.</li>\n<li>Magnets protected my a current to reroute magnetic current away from the hard drives.</li>\n<li>Hackers can't attack as it would be completely unconnected offline.</li>\n<li>Thieves couldn't get into the safe as it would be protected as well as if they did the hard drives would be encrypted.</li>\n</ul>\n"

Having a request that passes the auth token in the body is important <strong>if</strong>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Someone is targeting your system for DDOS attack</li>\n<li>They don't have enough bandwidth at their disposal to simply overrun your network resources (<a href=\"https://www.incapsula.com/blog/new-ddos-attack-method-demands-a-fresh-approach-to-amplification-assault-mitigation.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DDOS of network resources via amplifications attacks alone accounts for ~half of all DDOS attacks</a>)</li>\n<li>They therefore decide to target particular endpoints in your system that are resource-intensive</li>\n<li>They happen to stumble upon this unpublished endpoint and are able to figure out how the API call works</li>\n<li>They don't find another endpoint in your system that is more resource intensive</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If all of those conditions are met, then indeed, someone might use this endpoint to DDOS your system, and the difference between authentication in the header and in the body may in fact matter.  However, in case it isn't clear, <strong>these conditions are never going to be met</strong>.  If someone wants to DDOS your systems they will probably just go off and <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3180246/data-protection/hire-a-ddos-service-to-take-down-your-enemies.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rent a DDOS</a> that will flood your systems with meaningless network traffic.  It is both easier and more effective then trying to identify an actual weak point in your system.  This is the primary reason why this doesn't matter from the perspective of a DDOS: the DDOS attack you are worried about is never going to happen because there are easier and faster ways to DDOS a website than this.  The only way to protect against realistic kinds of DDOS attacks is with a DDOS mitigation provider.</p>\n\n<p>This is why threat modeling and understanding real world threats is so important.  You can spend weeks working with a third party provider to change their API in a way that minimizes CPU time on your end, only to then have your systems knocked out by a DDOS that blindly sends invalid requests into your network and overwhelms your network capacity.  If you spend your time protecting against the wrong kinds of threats, you can end up wasting a lot of time and (more importantly) implementing the wrong kinds of safe guards.</p>\n",

Each password should have at least 16 characters and must be sentence of at least 4 words to make it more secure and memorable. But this will make the attacker know that all passwords are like that. Is this a bad idea?  </p>\n\n<p>What better ways are there to force passwords that are more secure and memorable at the same time? </p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>You are not damaging the security of the passwords by telling the attacker that the password is at least 16 chars long, and comprised of 4 or more words. It's the same as telling that the password must have at least 10 chars, have at least one capitalized letter, one number and one symbol. Right?</p>\n\n<p>With 4 words, the cost of a bruteforce is bigger than 10 random chars. If you ask the user to use at least one capital letter, the cost increases even more.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Oxford dictionary, English have a little less than 175k words. There are 8.64 \u00d7 10<sup>20</sup> possible combinations. Using all 95 chars on an English keyboard, you have 5.98 \u00d7 10<sup>19</sup> possible combinations.</p>\n",
            " <p>It is not necessarily a bad idea. The attacker can know the password is in that format, considering the 4 words are random enough. But here is the thing, there are other good ways to make a memorable strong password. Limiting your users to the one you like is not very nice. For example I use password manager with truly random long passwords, which is even better than what you propose, but I could not do that on your site.</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, if the reason you want to do this is to force users to use strong password, then generate the 4 words password for them. You can generate such password by having a dictionary, then choosing random number between 1 and the number of words in your dictionary and taking that word. Do this 4 times and you have a password. You can get inspiration <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/jvdl/correcthorsebatterystaple/src\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. This is important, as most users may not choose 4 truly random words, but instead 4 easily guessable words. In such scenario, this would be worse then letting them choose any password.</p>\n",
            " <p>You are alluding to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27_principle\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kerckhoff's Principle</a>. When we design cryptographic systems, we assume that the attacker will know everything about your system except for the entropy derived parts (Keys/passwords/etc, typically) - this is because we can't guarantee that they don't know details, but must assume that they don't know our generated keys. Any password generation scheme follows this reasoning - if a password scheme is said to be secure, then you can believe that an attacker knowing which scheme you're using isn't a problem.</p>\n\n<p>The reason that it isn't a problem is due to the way that password namespaces work. If you demand that a user generate a password based off of a known diceware list, such as the EFF list, and you demand that it is at least 4 words long, then we can compute the namespace complexity. </p>\n\n<p>First, we'll figure out the namespace of a single word - In the EFF diceware list, you roll five six sided dice and pick the result that comes up. Because there are five positions with six options, we can compute 6^5, which gives us 7776 - this simply means that there are 7776 different possible words for each place.</p>\n\n<p>Now, we can compute the minimum namespace complexity of four of these words. This is simply done by taking the number of possible words and raising it to the power of the number of words in the password - 7776 ^ 4. This gives us 3656158440062976 (3.6 Quadrillion) possible different passwords of four EFF diceware words.</p>\n\n<p>Now, to guess how long this would take, we have to make some assumptions - </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>You are using a good hashing algorithm - scrypt, bcrypt, PBKDF2, etc.</p></li>\n<li><p>The attacker has consumer grade hardware. - We'll look at some benchmarks for an array of 8x 1080 TIs, which are top of the line at time of writing, but shouldn't be taken as the maximum hash rate - the NSA, etc probably has special hardware just for hashing passwords as fast as possible.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We can see from <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/epixoip/ace60d09981be09544fdd35005051505\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this benchmark</a> that in OpenCL, an attacker with 8x 1080 Ti can attack good algorithms at the following rates:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>scrypt at a rate of ~ 6.4 million hashes per second.</li>\n<li>bcrypt at a rate of 184 thousand hashes per second.</li>\n<li>PBKDF2-SHA256 at a rate of 775 thousand hashes per second.</li>\n<li>SHA1 (just for comparison, don't use this for passwords) at a rate of 101 billion hashes per second.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So for our given namespace of 3.6 quadrillion possible passwords, we can compute the following expected times to crack - please keep in mind that on average, 50% of the namespace will need to be exhausted, not 100%.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>scrpyt - 571274756.25984 seconds (~9 years)</li>\n<li>bcrypt - 19870426304.690086956521739130435 seconds (~315 years)</li>\n<li>PBKDF2 - 4717623793.6296464516129032258065 seconds (~75 years)</li>\n<li>SHA1 - 36199.588515475009900990099009901 seconds (~.2 days)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So, we can see that you need to implement a good hashing algorithm as well. </p>\n\n<p>Two things are missing from this algorithm - first, we didn't omit words shorter than 4 characters. The EFF diceware list has many words that are 3 characters long. If you increase the minimum word length, you reduce the namespace. I think the EFF list has ~500 words that are 3 characters long, but that's a guess. So, the namespace is slightly less complex.</p>\n\n<p>Second, we treated these passwords are randomly derived. Because you instead wanted sentences, we need to keep in mind that sentences aren't random. If you want the sentences to make sense, then there are attacks you can perform against them - you can use Markov chains and other fun stuff to generate likely sentences rather than plain brute forcing the password. I have no statistics on how much easier this is than brute forcing, so I'm going to go ahead and say you should assume it makes a huge difference and is much weaker.</p>\n",

            " <p><strong>Memorability.</strong> A 4-word password will definitely be easier to remember than a random password, but that doesn't mean the average user will actually remember it without writing it down or using a password manager anyway (there are just too many <em>different</em> passwords to remember nowadays). So memorability is useful and is great, but it might not be as useful as you think.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Security.</strong> A 4-word password will be more secure than the average password only if the words are chosen randomly from a sufficiently large set of words. According to <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/unmasked/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> article I've found the entropy of the password used by an average user is expected to be about 21 bits (2<sup>21</sup> = 2.1 \u00d7 <strong>10<sup>6</sup></strong>), which is worryingly low. If you choose 4 words randomly from a list of the 1000 most common English words, you would have 1000<sup>4</sup> = <strong>10<sup>12</sup></strong> possibilities, so a password that is 1 million times harder to bruteforce than the average password. </p>\n\n<p>So, generally speaking, your idea is not bad, as long as you don't let your users pick their own words, or they'll end up choosing passwords like \"pass pass pass pass\" or \"1 2 3 4\", etc. And of course, this is all speaking in general, because there are definitely specific cases where your method would actually decrease the security of the password. For example, your method would decrease the security of <strong>my</strong> password because I tend to use long random passwords by default, so if you forced me to use your method on your application I would be using a less secure password than usual. The same is probably true for communities like this one, where I hope the average password entropy is far greater than 21 bits and probably greater than your 4-word passwords.</p>\n",

Using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">diceware</a> is relatively good for the human aspect without being bad for the computer aspect, so it's an acceptable way to generate passwords.</p>\n\n<p>But if you want memorability, you cannot dictate to users how to generate passwords.  Nor can you require that they use passwords you generate for them.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few obvious things to avoid, like restricting password lengths to something unreasonably short, requiring characters from a particular list (like digits or punctuation), or prohibiting characters from a particular list (like spaces or quotes).  So how can you avoid those but still require secure passwords?</p>\n\n<p>You need to estimate a lower bound on entropy of the entered password, and set your policy to only accept passwords with an estimate above some minimum (possibly based on the desired minimum crack time).  The only such estimation tool I know of is <a href=\"https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">zxcvbn</a> (which unfortunately doesn't reject \"correct horse battery staple\").</p>\n\n<p>This will allow the use of relatively short randomly generated passwords and of relatively long diceware passwords, without requiring either, or allowing either to be inadequate.  The user can choose the method best for them, and you can require the level of crack-resistance you need.</p>\n\n<p>Generating and recommending diceware passwords might be helpful, and I think it's a good idea, but I would have to make sure that process didn't introduce new vulnerabilities before I would use it myself.  (Another thing to provide links about, if you do it.)</p>\n\n<p>(I'd also be inclined to have a password security chaos monkey constantly try to crack your users passwords, and force a reset whenever it succeeds.  But I'm not sure if that would actually succeed on weak passwords more often than unlucky passwords.)</p>\n",

I will not even discuss whether it will enforce <em>password</em> security (you already got a comment about 32 random characters password generated by a password manager), but more the effect on global security.</p>\n\n<p>You are adding a constraint for end users. Some (uneducated) always use same password. They hardly remembered it and do not want to be bothered by a new one so they will not use your web app if they can. Other will say: that is a nice idea, but I will not be able to remember that for a long time... let's write it down on that sheet! Those that are used to a good password manager will say <em>how stupid it is that I cannot use my random generator!</em> and again will avoid the app if they can.</p>\n\n<p>The only use case where I can accept password rules is for the main password in a corporate environment. Employees are supposed to use it everyday (every working day...) and only one is normally needed, thanks to Single Sign On solutions, so remembering it should not be a problem. For all other use cases, the end user is assumed to be responsable for his/her own data and my opinion is that anything above a minimal length is an <em>annoying</em> constraint, and I will try hard not to use that site.</p>\n",
            " <p>Don't, but do give the user that is trying to set a thoroughly insecure password a warning and make them confirm they really want to set it.</p>\n\n<p>Forcing people to set a password that is above what they can memorize will not only have them write it down, but write it down haphazardly and in an insecure place.</p>\n\n<p>Also, in some organizations, the ability to use a secure (by complexity) but shared (among an authorized team) and/or predocumented (under lock and key) passphrase is desirable - password guidelines that reject some reasonably secure passwords can become a real annoyance here.

            " <blockquote>\n  <p>is there some good reason from a security perspective to allow only TLS 1.0, or is it simply pure \"laziness\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is in most cases just the TLS stack used. One of the most common stacks in web servers on UNIX/Linux is OpenSSL and the still widely used (and supported) versions 0.9.8 and 1.0.0 can do only TLS 1.0 and lower. TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 were only added with version 1.0.1 (04/2012). On the Windows side SecureChannel supports TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 since Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 (end of 2009).</p>\n\n<p>And while changing the TLS stack might be doable for some sites it involves is most cases either the upgrade of the operating system or at least to run some parts of the system in a configuration not supported by the vendor.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>and there is no good reason not to allow TLS1.1 and TLS1.2 in addition to TLS1.0?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the server has support for TLS 1.2 there is no  real reason to set the server up for only TLS 1.0. In fact, TLS 1.2 not only gives better security but also new cipher suites which can lessen the load on the server.</p>\n",
            " <p>There is no security benefit in disabling TLS1.1 and 1.2 in favor of 1. And there is actually no compatibility benefit either<sup>*</sup>.</p>\n\n<p>The reasons why some sites only support TLS1 is, that the software and/or configuration is simply too old.</p>\n\n<p>Just stating the obvious, disabling all protocol versions older than TLSv1.2 is a security benefit as all of them have known weaknesses compared to 1.2.</p>\n\n<p><sup>*</sup> <i>On server side. It is unfortunately a bit different for clients which have to talk to very old and broken servers. They might not want to offer TLS1.1 or TLS1.2 for compatibility reasons. Or actually if they offer it, they might want to retry without.</i></p>\n",
            " <p>An update for all those who might discover this question.\nIt's now 2017, and TLS1.0 is deprecated and should not be used.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, if you have any form of credit card interactions on your site (even if the credit card data is posted directly to the payment gateway site, and does not touch your server) then, in order to comply with PCI/DSS rules, TLS1.0 has to be disabled on the server, effectively cutting off older browsers.</p>\n\n<p>And by 'older browsers' we are talking anything up to IE10 on Windows 7!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: As pointed out below, TLS1.0 is still officially allowed on existing sites until the end of June 2018. However, this does not seem to filtered down to all the testing services, so you may find even existing sites are required to stop supporting TLS1.0 sooner than expected.</p>\n"

            " <p>After much toil, I think the only way to do this is by creating an InfoPath-based content-type.  You can create the form with whatever fields you like, and add whatever styles you like.  </p>\n\n<p>Now, to make it work, you have to make sure your certificate is installed in Central Administration > Security > Manage Trust.  (See <a href=\"http://sharepointfordeveloper.blogspot.com/2011/11/sharepoint2010-root-of-certificate.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this thread</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Also, you have to upload a data connection file.  First, create a <code>Data Connections</code> library somewhere in your portal.  Then, in InfoPath, you have to go to (in the ribbon) Data > Data Connections, and, having selected your data connection(you know, when you told it whence to upload the submitted forms), click on \"Convert to Connection File\".  It will prompt you for a url with a file name.  You should specify the url to your data connection library that you just created in your sharepoint portal, and give it a file name with the extension .udcx - something like this:  <a href=\"http://myportal.mydomain.com/dataconnectionlibrary/myDataconnection.udcx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://myportal.mydomain.com/dataconnectionlibrary/myDataconnection.udcx</a></p>\n\n<p>After that is done, you can go into your forms library and add the new content-type, complete with all your nice formatting.  If you want to display the form's fields and values like a regular list instead of like a document library, you have to create a new \"standard\" view.</p>\n\n<p>Hope that helps someone!</p>\n"

I have a ridiculously simple SPDesigner workflow that just has a single action to Update the list item and set the contents of a field to be a link to a form I built to print the list item in a pretty way.  I have the workflow bound to OnCreate and OnChange.  I publish the workflow and everything works properly.</p>\n\n<p>The Problem:\nEvery few months the workflow suddenly stops generating the print link.  When I investigate I can see that the workflow isn't trying to run (i.e. It doesn't say \"Cancelled\" or \"Failed\" or \"Complete\" in the Workflow execution column of the list ... the column is just blank.  Similarly the workflow history list doesn't get any entries when I add items to the list either.)  So I open up Designer and check the workflow and it says it is still bound to Create and Change.  However, the only way to fix the workflow is to publish it again.</p>\n\n<p>The Question: I'm at my wits end to try and troubleshoot this problem.  Has anybody encountered anything similar?  Does anybody have any suggestions as to how I might troubleshoot this?  (I should probably mention that I don't have server access to this farm, so I'm restricted to things I can accomplish through Designer, CSOM, and the web UI)</p>\n\n<p>Help me StackExchange ... you're my only hope!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: \nHere is exactly what the workflow does...</p>\n\n<p>Step 1</p>\n\n<p>Set Variable: url to /site/restOfPath/ListName/PrintView.aspx?ID=[%Current Item:ID%], print</p>\n\n<p>then Update item in Current Item (to set column printLink = Variable: url, where the printLink column is of type HyperLink)</p>\n\n<p>...that's all.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Environment: SP2010 Enterprise, VS2012</p>\n\n<p>I've been using C# to programmatically create alerts for various users and implementing the alert.Filter property to assign filters that point to specific directories. It's simple enough to create a variable for the path to insert into the filter, but when it comes to the username, passing a variable in its place does not seem to work using any method I have tried. CAML (or at least the pseudo-CAML used in filters) likes the user's name to actually be the name <strong>field</strong> (in this case, pulled from AD) not the <strong>account</strong> name. So after a little playing around I figured out how to turn that into a variable to pass into the filter like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>string userName = vUser.Name;\nstring oFilter = (\"&lt;Query&gt;&lt;And&gt;&lt;Or&gt;&lt;Eq&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='ItemFullUrl'/&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + fullPath + \"&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Eq&gt;&lt;BeginsWith&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='ItemFullUrl'/&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + fullPath + \"/&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/BeginsWith&gt;&lt;/Or&gt;&lt;Neq&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + userName + \"&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='Editor/New'/&gt;&lt;/Neq&gt;&lt;/And&gt;&lt;/Query&gt;)\");\noAlert.Filter = oFilter;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The user.Name property outputs a name that matches the format in the CAML filter of a working alert I examined. If I type the name directly into the filter it works fine, but when I try to pass it as a variable it breaks, even if I explicitly set the variable to \"User Name\".</p>\n\n<p>Is there some part of how the filter/string works that I'm not accounting for? Every search I've done online has said this method should work, in theory. My goal is simply to make the alert apply only to changes made by other users, is there perhaps another way to accomplish that?</p>\n\n<p>Any advice is greatly appreciated!</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I've been trying for quite a few hours to customize the thumbnail view on a picture library in SharePoint 2013 without luck.</p>\n\n<p>What I want to do is add the date the picture was taken underneath the title of the image. So that it displays both when the thumbnail view is collapsed, and when it's moused over.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried to google this alot, and tried both jQuery solutions and editing the vwstyles.xml and vwstyles.xsl files. Doing iisreset everytime I edit something, but without any luck.</p>\n\n<p>It feels like the class names and id's in the xml and xsl files aren't present in the actual page, and the other way around.</p>\n\n<p>So I was wondering if anyone in here had done the same earlier, because I'm running out of ideas on where to edit these files to make the changes appear on the page.</p>\n\n<p>I made a new ViewStyle in the xml file (copied from the \"ViewStylePicLibDetailsName\" style) and copied the same ID in the xsl file and gave both new ID's and a new name for my ViewStyle.

For example when I first learn asp.net mvc I have read how to build an application named NerdDinner (which is simple mvc application) but it was a solid starting point to understand MVC details and more advance functionalities. </p>\n\n<p>So from where I can find demos which show how to build a simple SharePoint 2013 applications, bearing in mind that what I am trying to achieve in SharePoint 2013 (at least for the current stage) are :-</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>To build a knowledge library categorizing all our company procedures, manuals, technical material, policies, etc.</p></li>\n<li><p>Enable employees to write the above contents and publish them, so they can be view, edited, updated, delete by specific users.</p></li>\n<li><p>To have some workflows on certain documents, so that they will not be available to employees until they went through predefined approval steps.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I'm a software developer recently in charge of entire project (project manager). The project I'm working on (with 6 other persons) is a complex Java-based application that's being developed for over 5 years. The entire time we were using SVN, without branching. Now, I would like to switch to Git as I do believe Git will provide superior branching and ease some development.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, before I do switch, I have to tell you about the current workflow we're having with SVN, I have to hear opinion from people experienced with Git and to tell you what are the things I expect from Git. <em>Please</em> tell me if Git can provide the things I need the way I need them, because if I switch the entire project to Git and then it turns out I have to revert it to SVN (for any reason), I would be dead :) .</p>\n\n<p>The principle we're following with SVN is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Each team member is working on a single feature. When such feature is done, a local copy of dev's code is updated against SVN master and feature is deployed for testing. If testing by clients passed, the person developing the code pushes it to our main (and only) branch with a proper commit message that explains the feature, ticket number and so on.</p></li>\n<li><p>If, during \"update before deploying for testing\" the team member gets into conflicts, he's cherry-picking conflicting files line by line.</p></li>\n<li>When time comes that we deploy new features to production, I load the production code from a particular folder on the disk (like \"physical branch\"), I sync that code to the current state of the SVN, going class by class, reviewing committed changed and taking the code meant for that particular deploy. Usually, it happens that out of 230 classes we have in the repo (and not in production workspace) bewteen 30 and 50 classes are with conflicts because of the features we don't need on production yet. Sometimes, clients ask for the latest features <strong>before</strong> wanting some older features. If both feature they want and features they don't affect the same file, I have to manually skip some particular file from commit version number 3 to commit version number 6 <strong>without</strong> taking any changes from commits 4 or 5. Now, if another file is also affected, it happens that another file from version, say, 35, I have to update to version 40 without taking any changes done between 35 and 40.\nWith SVN, it's easy, I sync a particular file and pick only the lines of codes ignoring all others. It takes time but I am in a position to tell clients \"we'll postpone this for X days\".</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also, if two developers are working on different features that largely affect the same subsystem or big number of the same files, in order to avoid nasty conflicts and collisions I usually tell clients \"we can't develop both things in the same time, we'll postpone feature B till feature A is done and tested\" and one of the devs get to work on something else.</p>\n\n<p>Now, from Git the only thing I basically need is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Nice Windows GUI (for SVN we're using \"Subclipse\" plugin for Eclipse). I'm really not into investing a lot of time just learning or remembering how to push a branch or view the history or do something similar if it can be done with the click of a button. For me, the version control system should be just a tool - not something my devs should spend more than a day learning how to use because of CLI and advanced things we'll never use or require. With SVN we use only 4 commands: commit, update, synchronize (to see the differences) and \"history\". Ok, sometimes we do use \"compare with version X from repo\" but not so often.</li>\n<li>The ability to achieve nice code storage by using only a few basic commands (button clicks to be precise :D ): push / pull, fetch / commit, branch / merge, view history. Nothing fancy or advanced which would take a lot of time to learn or understand.</li>\n<li>The ability to partially take commits. For example: commit consists of 10 files. I take all changes from 8 files, but for two files I do cherry-pick in a manner that from current production version 5 I take two lines of code from file commit version 7 and few lines from file commit version 9 (effectively keeping those two files in \"undefined version\" so that I can supply my clients with the newest changes without all code changes preceding that newest feature I want). To achieve this point, for me it's not a problem to allocate an entire day digging through history and commits regardless if it's SVN or Git. That's my \"preparing deploy\" day anyway :)</li>\n<li>Having numerical commit versions, not HASH-based ones!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is it possible with Git?

Commits should never contain two unrelated changes. This should allow you to <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">cherry-pick</a> the features you want by cherry-picking commits. It also allows you to create a release with only the features your customers request by merging the feature-branches which correspond to these features.</p>\n\n<p>So if you have this requirement, you are using Git wrong. </p>\n\n<p>However, if you are ever in the situation where you need to merge only parts of a commit, you should create a new commit on the feature-branch which reverts the changes you don't want and then merge the branch. If you still want to keep working on the features you don't want to merge into mainline, you would create that commit on a new branch which you merge and keep developing on the old branch.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\u2022Having numerical commit versions, not HASH-based ones!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sorry, but Git doesn't do that. Git encourages decentralized, parallel development on multiple branches with multiple commits per branch, so incrementing commit numbers just don't fit into the Git philosophy. However, you can use <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-tag\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tags</a> in Git to manually assign numbers (or other descriptors) to commits. You can do that on your master-branch after merging from the feature-branches.</p>\n"

If it's your code, you should have a very good idea of what is causing the error before you attempt to fix it. </p>\n\n<p>Futhermore, when you write your code you should already know where and why it's likely to fail.</p>\n\n<p>Having said that - asking a peer, posting on SO, retracing and rolling back your steps and taking a break - all the suggestions mentioned above will help.</p>\n\n<p>The other thing, is you must know your tools - your debugging toolkit. Logging messages at suspect points in your code, examining your call stack carefully, using conditional breakpoints and watches, etc etc. Debugging skills are not extras - they are part of programming.</p>\n",

            " <p>All of these suggestions are great.  However, I use a technique quite often that I didn't see mentioned.  Make lists to organize your thoughts about the problem.  If I have a particularly sticky problem I usually write out multiple lists such as: Facts, Assumptions, Questions, Symptoms, etc.  I find that oftentimes in the process of organizing things in this way I discover assumptions I didn't realize I had (that often turn out to be wrong), questions I didn't realize need to be asked, other permutations I can check, etc.</p>\n",

            " <p>I really didn't like the most up-voted answer, because even though that sometime works, some times you just need to figure it out that same day, so what I'd recommend, in this order, is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Confirm that it's not only happening to you. This can save you a lot of time. Maybe you uninstalled a required component, or made a change in your environment, and an exception is being swallowed somewhere in your code. If it's happening only to you, I would use an environment comparison tool. I recently read about a software called Envy, which allows you to do just that, although it's not freeware, it costs 10 USD.</p></li>\n<li><p>Happening to everybody? Fine, now do a View History on the code and verify for recent changes that might have caused the error, either directly or indirectly.</p></li>\n<li><p>There aren't any recent changes? If it's a very specific error (an exception), 'stackoverflow it'. Now that doesn't sound better than 'google it' but I feel good to say I first search stackoverflow for programming research than google. If it's a really known issue, it's very likely that you'll find a solution here. If not, then post a question on the related stackexchange site. You might get a very quick answer, or even if you don't, your question will be out there while you do more research. That's a benefit.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you didn't find an answer online or it isn't a general error, then walk through the code step by step, checking if the obtained results of each step make sense for the result you expect. Go start to finish on each method, and bottom to top on a tiered solution. (i.e. if you're troubleshooting performance, start with the code that retrieves the records. doesn't make sense to start in the UI if you can determine quickly if the first step is the problem).</p></li>\n<li><p>If after going through the code a couple of times you still haven't found what's wrong, call-in someone to talk about it. As someone already mentioned, talking about it out loud can light the bulb. Plus pair-programming is really useful.</p></li>\n<li><p>At this point, if it's feasible, walk away either for some time or for the day. I read a very true tweet yesterday that said \"I went to bed thinking 'how the fck' and woke up thinking 'but of course'\". So true.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you still don't have an answer, I'd dare say you could try refactoring into smaller tasks/methods/functions. Henry Ford said something like 'There isn't a task so complex that cannot be accomplished by breaking it into smaller tasks'. At this point, if the solution is too complex and you haven't figured out either by yourself or with the help of someone else, refactor the code into smaller tasks. Even if you don't end up commiting it, it can help you find the reason.</p></li>\n<li><p>Add instrumentation to your code.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tweet about it??</p></li>\n</ol>\n",

The computer's strength is its logic so you can't win on logic. You have a brain and have to out-think it. </p>\n\n<p>In modern times there are so many other things interacting on a system - firewalls, AV, Antispyware, automatic updates happening every night - you have to deal with moving targets.</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>We have a system where multiple consumers get messages out of a queue (currently implemented with a database). The messages have an order field. All messages of one particular order should be processed synchronous. Meaning that 2 messages of the same order should never be processed at the same time by different consumers. They should have a 'lock' on the order field.</p>\n\n<p>We used to process only a handful of messages, but after a few scale ups we're currently processing ~400 messages/s with 10 consumers. We nearly reached the maximum capability of our database and would like to scale further.</p>\n\n<p>That's why we'd like to implement this system with a message queue. However, message queues are not designed to lock messages for certain consumers on a certain field.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What would be the best design for a queue solution with multiple consumers, where the consumers can lock messages for other consumers based on a certain field value in the queue?</strong> Use multiple queues? Implement the actor model? ...?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>What do you do if the consumer that was handling an order crashed?</p>\n\n<p>You do not want to have a consumer receive items on an order and process them. You want an intermediary that builds partial orders with the items that are being pushed.</p>\n\n<p>So, on one side you have a producer that begins an order, add items to the order and finishes the order. In the middle you have the intermediary that aggregates the items into partial order objects. In the other side you have the consumer of orders.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Deciding what design to implement:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pull vs Push</li>\n<li>Synchronous vs. Asynchronous.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Pull vs Push</h2>\n\n<p>Push based design requires a simpler threading model (I go back to this), it is harder to get it wrong.</p>\n\n<p>The Push based design will just be doing a method call to notify consumers. Which means it will be aware if they fail (e.g. thrown exception). And this makes it easy to have it push the value to a different consumer if a consumer crashed.</p>\n\n<p><em>If we do that at the level of items being pushed into the order, then it will be very hard to go to a different consumer. It would require to keep track of partially completed orders. The intermediary solves this problem. Once we have the intermediary it makes much more sense to aggregate an order and process it as a single value.</em></p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if the consumer fails on a Pull based design, there is no easy way for the producer to know.

            " <p>Python is a dynamically-typed language. This has two important consequences:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The compiler is unable to reject certain kinds of logical error at compile time which would be caught by a C++ compiler</li>\n<li>Because the types of some (even most) variables cannot be determined at compile time, operations on those variables must be implemented by dynamically dispatching a method call (a fairly slow operation) whereas C++ compilers are often able to generate inline code (which has no overhead). C++ is therefore an inherently faster\nlanguage.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The former of these is actually surprisingly useful. See for example the Boost Units library, which allows scientific and engineering code to be written in a way that allows the compiler to statically check that the calculations have logically consistent unit usage at compile time, with no runtime overhead. This would be impossible in Python.</p>\n\n<p>Python also has very poor support for multithreading. Its language design requires certain operations (for instance modifications to lists) to complete atomically, which has lead to the most common implementation using a global lock to prevent two threads executing Python code at the same time (although if one thread calls native code the other will be allowed to procede), because the overhead of locking and unlocking individual objects made single threaded performance terrible.</p>\n\n<p>C++, on the other hand, leaves the job of ensuring code is thread-safe up to the developer, which allows for efficient multithreading.</p>\n\n<p>C++ also gives developers much more control over memory management, allowing for example generic containers that allocate user-specified object types inside their structures (leading to lower overhead and better locality of reference than is possible with Python), allocating objects in specified memory regions (e.g. so that multiple objects can be deleted in a single operation, or to allocate them in a memory-mapped file) or using developer-supplied custom allocators.</p>\n\n<p>C++ is also loosely typed, which means you can use an area of memory for one type of data, and then change to treating it as containing another type. While operations of this type are dangerous (and the language specification states that programs that do this have \"undefined behavior\"), if you know what you're doing you can use this to implement dynamic loading of code modules, runtime native code generation, direct manipulation of file structures without individually extracting fields as you would have to in Python, and a wide variety of other uses. This is why operating systems can be implemented in C++ and not in Python.</p>\n"

            " <p>Everything you said sounds close, but it's missing some details on vector creation and querying that are important. Ideally you need to form unique vectors for each image. You'll need to convert the color into HSV (or HSL) or a color space that lends itself to comparisons. Assign a number to each choice for the components. </p>\n\n<p>Next assign a weight to each component in your vector. This should normalize the importance of each component. If you can imagine your vector in n-dimensional space you want each component to have equal weight (or be biased by its importance in the comparison). As an example lines might not be important so in the range [0, 1] horizontal = 0.2 and vertical = 0.4. Outdoor might be an important distinction so indoor = 0.5 and outdoor = 1.0. (You don't have to stay between 0 and 1, but it does keep it simple).</p>\n\n<p>For colors you have to handle them specially. For color assign each component a number between [0, 1] (for each HSV component).</p>\n\n<p>My only worry with your setup is your categorization is very simple and your color and theme system is a bit complex having multiple colors and themes. When generating a vector you'd essentially want to union the results with the vector and each color and theme. So for a single image with you'd generate every combination of vector (filtering for components you're searching for). Example:</p>\n\n<p>(blue, natural,light, ...)<br>\n(blue, land, light, ...)<br>\n(blue, sky, light, ...)<br>\n(green, natural, light, ...)<br>\n(green, land, light, ...)<br>\n(green, sky, light, ...)<br>\n(grey, natural, light, ...)<br>\n(grey, land, light, ...)<br>\n(grey, sky, light, ...)</p>\n\n<p>You'd convert each component to their numeric weighted values, so you'd have a real vector in n-dimensional space. (blue would be converted to 3 HSV components just to be very clear).</p>\n\n<p>When you have vectors based on the parameters you want to compare you'd normally use a k-d tree nearest neighbor look-up.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree#Nearest_neighbour_search\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree#Nearest_neighbour_search</a></p>\n\n<p>Then perform for each vector an n neighbor look-up to get a set of vectors associated with an image. Then union the resulting sets. If you find nothing increase n in your sampling. You can use a dot product calculation averaged for all vector comparisons to kind of get a similarity factor if you're looking for a percentage of similarity. (Might need to be clever in that regard if you compare a lot of components since it'll make the images appear more dissimilar than they might seem to the eye).</p>\n\n<p>This is a very rough overview of k-d tree data mining. You'd need to read a data mining book to get the more exact answer and other approaches. (Creating the weights though is a bit of an art since it's up to you if color is more important than theme or shape).</p>\n",

So, you will need to map them to real numbers.  A range from 0 to 1 will work just fine, as Sirisian suggested. You can probably combine your discrete color and your discrete brightness together into three property values, whether they be HSV, HSL, or perhaps even RGB, I don't think it will matter much.</p></li>\n<li><p>You want a variable number of results, and you want some randomness.  So, select a percentage of entities at the end of the sorted list, and choose a specific number from them, at random.</p></li>\n</ul>\n",
        "rejected_target": " <p>Everything you said sounds close, but it's missing some details on vector creation and querying that are important. Ideally you need to form unique vectors for each image. You'll need to convert the color into HSV (or HSL) or a color space that lends itself to comparisons. Assign a number to each choice for the components. </p>\n\n<p>Next assign a weight to each component in your vector. This should normalize the importance of each component. If you can imagine your vector in n-dimensional space you want each component to have equal weight (or be biased by its importance in the comparison). As an example lines might not be important so in the range [0, 1] horizontal = 0.2 and vertical = 0.4. Outdoor might be an important distinction so indoor = 0.5 and outdoor = 1.0. (You don't have to stay between 0 and 1, but it does keep it simple).</p>\n\n<p>For colors you have to handle them specially. For color assign each component a number between [0, 1] (for each HSV component).</p>\n\n<p>My only worry with your setup is your categorization is very simple and your color and theme system is a bit complex having multiple colors and themes. When generating a vector you'd essentially want to union the results with the vector and each color and theme. So for a single image with you'd generate every combination of vector (filtering for components you're searching for). Example:</p>\n\n<p>(blue, natural,light, ...)<br>\n(blue, land, light, ...)<br>\n(blue, sky, light, ...)<br>\n(green, natural, light, ...)<br>\n(green, land, light, ...)<br>\n(green, sky, light, ...)<br>\n(grey, natural, light, ...)<br>\n(grey, land, light, ...)<br>\n(grey, sky, light, ...)</p>\n\n<p>You'd convert each component to their numeric weighted values, so you'd have a real vector in n-dimensional space. (blue would be converted to 3 HSV components just to be very clear).</p>\n\n<p>When you have vectors based on the parameters you want to compare you'd normally use a k-d tree nearest neighbor look-up.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree#Nearest_neighbour_search\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree#Nearest_neighbour_search</a></p>\n\n<p>Then perform for each vector an n neighbor look-up to get a set of vectors associated with an image. Then union the resulting sets. If you find nothing increase n in your sampling. You can use a dot product calculation averaged for all vector comparisons to kind of get a similarity factor if you're looking for a percentage of similarity. (Might need to be clever in that regard if you compare a lot of components since it'll make the images appear more dissimilar than they might seem to the eye).</p>\n\n<p>This is a very rough overview of k-d tree data mining. You'd need to read a data mining book to get the more exact answer and other approaches. (Creating the weights though is a bit of an art since it's up to you if color is more important than theme or shape).</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Absolutely academic context question-</p>\n\n<p>I found countless articles listing the order of operator precedence in all languages, but what is the logical reasoning behind that specific order?</p>\n\n<p>For clarity of answers, let's talk about the C/C++/C# precedence table, even though it is pretty much the same in all other languages.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>There isn't some grand logical scheme, especially in C and the derivatives that kept its order. It's basically a combination of \"this feels right\" and historical accident.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, you want to keep the precedence of arithmetic operations that you learned in school: <code>*</code> and <code>/</code> before <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>. All the number manipulation should be somewhere in that area. (Except the bitwise logical operators, I'll get there.)</p>\n\n<p>Next, you want comparison operators. The reason is that interpreting <code>x + y == z</code> as <code>x + (y == z)</code> is simply rarely what you want, even though it's legal in C and C++. (Not in C# or Java.) Generally you first calculate some term, and then compare it to something else. You don't generally compare something and then take the result of that comparison as a numerical value for other calculations.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, you want logical operators. Again, this is simply based on intuition and usefulness. <code>x == y &amp;&amp; a == b</code> is not very useful as <code>x == (y &amp;&amp; a) == b</code>. <code>&amp;&amp;</code> has precedence over <code>||</code> because that's the way it is done in the mathematical foundations.</p>\n\n<p>So what about those bitwise logical operations? Well, early C didn't have the logical short-circuiting <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code>. <code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code> <em>were</em> the logical operators (and also did double-duty as the bitwise operators). Since C didn't have a boolean datatype either but just used <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>, they did that job just fine, except for that pesky precedence thing. (Also, C was meant to closely reflect the underlying machine operations, and the underlying machine didn't distinguish logical and bitwise AND and OR either.) Thus, you find the bitwise operators way down in the precedence with the logical operators, and that's why you have to write <code>(flags &amp; mask) == expected</code>.</p>\n\n<p>So, historical accident. Some newer languages break from C in the precedence of the bitwise operations.</p>\n\n<p>Similar reasoning can be applied to the unary operators.</p>\n",
            " <p>The designers of the Fortress Programming Language did extensive reviews of scientific literature to see how operators are used and what relative precedence they have. Based on those observations, they designed operator precedence in Fortress. This is the only instance I know of where a Programming Language Designer has explicitly written down their rationale for Operator Precedence.</p>\n\n<p>Operator Precedence in Fortress works a little bit different from other languages. The main difference is that there is no globally defined precedence across all operators. Instead, operators have <em>relative</em> precedence to other operators: <code>*</code> is-higher-than <code>+</code>, for example. Using two operators in the same expression without explicit parentheses that do not have a defined operator precedence, is a Syntax Error.

        "rejected_target": " <p>There isn't some grand logical scheme, especially in C and the derivatives that kept its order. It's basically a combination of \"this feels right\" and historical accident.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, you want to keep the precedence of arithmetic operations that you learned in school: <code>*</code> and <code>/</code> before <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>. All the number manipulation should be somewhere in that area. (Except the bitwise logical operators, I'll get there.)</p>\n\n<p>Next, you want comparison operators. The reason is that interpreting <code>x + y == z</code> as <code>x + (y == z)</code> is simply rarely what you want, even though it's legal in C and C++. (Not in C# or Java.) Generally you first calculate some term, and then compare it to something else. You don't generally compare something and then take the result of that comparison as a numerical value for other calculations.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, you want logical operators. Again, this is simply based on intuition and usefulness. <code>x == y &amp;&amp; a == b</code> is not very useful as <code>x == (y &amp;&amp; a) == b</code>. <code>&amp;&amp;</code> has precedence over <code>||</code> because that's the way it is done in the mathematical foundations.</p>\n\n<p>So what about those bitwise logical operations? Well, early C didn't have the logical short-circuiting <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code>. <code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code> <em>were</em> the logical operators (and also did double-duty as the bitwise operators). Since C didn't have a boolean datatype either but just used <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>, they did that job just fine, except for that pesky precedence thing. (Also, C was meant to closely reflect the underlying machine operations, and the underlying machine didn't distinguish logical and bitwise AND and OR either.) Thus, you find the bitwise operators way down in the precedence with the logical operators, and that's why you have to write <code>(flags &amp; mask) == expected</code>.</p>\n\n<p>So, historical accident. Some newer languages break from C in the precedence of the bitwise operations.</p>\n\n<p>Similar reasoning can be applied to the unary operators.</p>\n"

To make the language more tolerant to errors, it tries to guess where extra semicolons should go to make the code correct. Since this was sort of retro-fitted onto the C-like syntax, it doesn't always work as expected (sometimes, the script interpreter guesses wrong), and can make for fairly counter-intuitive code.</p>\n<p>Or, arguing in terms of &quot;explicit is better than implicit&quot;: In Python, a newline is already completely explicit, while in JavaScript, it is ambiguous, so you add the semicolon to make it explicit.</p>\n",

            " <p>There are a number of <em>good</em> reasons <strong>not</strong> to use semi-colon insertion in JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p>Primarily it's because semi-colon insertion as defined in the ECMAScript standard is unintuitive for some cases. @Svante points out a case for <code>return</code> where the newline usage will cause issues.</p>\n\n<p>What he doesn't mention is that it'll cause issues if you're <strong>using</strong> semi-colons as well, because semi-colon insertion happens whether you want it or not.</p>\n\n<p>Another very good reason <em>not</em> to use semi-colon insertion is output control. In many cases JavaScript is run through a minifier before being used in production. Some minifiers may handle automatic semi-colon insertion cases, but I see no reason to <em>rely</em> on it working perfectly</p>\n\n<p>Additionally for content management systems, inline JavaScript may be auto-minified, and I've seen a number of cases where the auto-minifier simply removes comments and trims whitespace (including newlines) from the beginning and end of each line.</p>\n\n<p>For authors who don't have a choice of what tools are being chosen, it's much easier to just stick to a format that works in the vast majority of cases.</p>\n",
            " <p>In Javascript, you can write a program that would be syntactically correct in the absence of automatic semicolon insertion, and ASI will transform that program into a <em>different</em> syntactically correct program (for example, transforming code that returns a value into code that returns nothing). There is no analogous case in Python. In Python any newline that <em>can</em> end a statement <em>will</em> end a statement, unless it is escaped with a backslash. Technically, I suppose that Javascript's rules are equally deterministic, but I don't know if you could summarize Javascript's rules for ending statements in a single sentence.</p>\n",
            " <p>There is a pretty fundamental difference from the way it works in Python, I think. Quoting from the post Einar Egilsson linked to: \"a semicolon is not implied at the end of a line if the first token of the subsequent line can be parsed as part of the same statement\".</p>\n\n<p>In Python a line break always ends the statement, except in certain fairly obvious cases such as within a parenthesized expression. JavaScript, on the other hand, will try to parse as many lines as it can before ending the statement, potentially leading to things like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Define a function and name it area.\narea = function(r) {\n    return r * r * 3.14159\n}\n\n// Fooled you! We're actually invoking it.\n(14)\n</code></pre>\n",
            " <p>In most cases JavaScript's ASI handles things as expected. One example of ASI perhaps not behaving the way you'd expect is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var i = 0\n\n(function() {\n   // do something\n})()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will be interpreted as calling the function <code>0</code> with the anonymous function, then executing the result. In this case you probably wanted to do an assignment, then immediately execute the anonymous function.</p>\n\n<p>To someone not familiar with ASI it can be very confusing when you run into problems like this, so I always recommend developers on my team to use semicolons.</p>\n\n<p>(As an aside: I don't use semicolons when working on personal/side projects because I know no one else would need to maintain the code.)</p>\n",
            " <p>I'd state one simple reason:</p>\n\n<p>Javascript looks \"kinda java-ish\" or \"kinda C-ish\". Of course it's a dynamic language so it looks different... but face it - <strong>There are braces. Languages with braces generally have semicolons.</strong> The natural reflexes kick in and make your finger go towards the semicolon key before you hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Python, on the contrary, even at a glance looks totally different.</strong> Hence, little or no analogy to \"the standard boring languages\" is intuitively formed and when one enters the \"python mode\", the lack of semicolons comes as natural.</p>\n",
            " <p>I can't remember which exact version of IE, but there are some cases where IE will literally error out if a semicolon is missing. IIRC it's when you have in the global scope something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var myFunc = function() {\n  ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you don't add the ; after the closing brace, the program will actually fail on some versions of IE. That, along with the other reasons (including Crockford's recommendation to always use them explicitly) have led me to always use them explicitly in every case.</p>\n",
            " <p>Like you, I think it's a bit paranoid. The rules for semicolon insertion are well defined in JavaScript, just as they are in Python and CoffeeScript.

            " <p>Here's my take on it after a couple of failed and a couple pretty good attempts:</p>\n\n<p>Programming is problem solving.</p>\n\n<p>Start off with concrete things that are programmed that they use every day - internet browser (facebook), cell phone, cash register, etc.  Get them to give you lots of examples.  Establish that all of these things have a kind of computer in them.  The heart of a computer is the processor.</p>\n\n<p>The processor is like a very fast, but very dumb worker.  If you give it some instructions, it will do them exactly as you say.  It won't do anything extra and it won't tell you if something you told it to do was wrong.  This processor does everything, though - if you tell it exactly how to do it, it can make a phone call or put a picture in an e-mail.</p>\n\n<p>Ask her how she would tell a very fast but very dumb worker to buy a can of soda from a soda machine.  As she starts describing the steps (\"Put money in the machine and press the button.\") start dissecting it like a program (\"What is money?  How do I put it in the machine?  When I put money in the machine and press the button at the same time, nothing happens.\").  If you have a whiteboard, start on the left with her first set of instructions.  As she revises them, place the new bigger list on the right side.  When you have a good set of instructions, start generalizing the pieces (\"Remove the money from your pocket and remove the soda from the tray sound similar - what parts are the same/different?\")  Take the generalizations and put them in the middle and cross off the pieces they now encompass.  Try to eventually tie up the pieces to match with her original instructions, kind of like function calls.  Other good exercises: mail a letter, go through a door, draw a circle/square/triangle.</p>\n\n<p>So Programming is problem solving: breaking problems up into parts, identifying parts that are common, and grouping those parts back to solve problems.  Soon, you find out that some parts are common across many problems, and then you start putting parts together to solve problems you didn't even know you had.</p>\n\n<p>Okay, by this point she may understand but she's probably bored.  Follow it up with a set of cool programming examples.  Shaders and related visual code is easy to demo - you can put up a picture and start making changes to it with very small code changes.  If she expressed interest in Facebook, show off talking to Facebook through REST to see friends of friends (6-degrees of her) data.  If she likes video games, show off a couple open source game demos along with a few snippets of their code and how they help the game work.  Finish it off by showing a couple of free tools and resources she could investigate at home.  (Python, C#, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>My failed attempts: trying to explain pi calculation (they were asking), the C-Jump board game <a href=\"http://c-jump.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://c-jump.com/</a> (they didn't get it and the instructions were buggy), and live coding a 2d game (just couldn't hold interest, no matter how small of steps I was taking between demos).</p>\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n",
            " <p>Firstly, you have competition that you need to debunk.</p>\n\n<p>Movies, popular culture, and even people in the field (<em>and this question for that matter</em>) attempt to portray programming (and the bulk of the computer science field) as some type of magic. <strong>It is not magic.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Programming is simply describing tasks and then combining those tasks to solve a problem.  If you are trying to find a parallel, use math. A computer is like a math teacher that requires you to <em>show all your work</em>.</p>\n\n<p>From a physical point of view, computers are not smart-- they only <em>know</em> as much as we tell them. So when a computer programmer wants to create a program that, for instance plays music off a CD, they 'simply' need to tell the computer how to read the data stored on the CD, then how to convert that data into sound waves and lastly, how to output those sound waves from your speakers.</p>\n\n<p>Taking this idea to the next level, you can go on about how programming builds tasks on top of each other. Just like he/she had to learn arithmetic before they could learn algebra in math, computers also need to be told how to 'do the basics' before you can tell them how to do more complex tasks. Over the years, computer scientists and programmers have been able to 'teach' computers enough of the basics to the point were we can start 'talking' to them much closer to how we talk to each other.</p>\n\n<p>Back in real life, your math teacher may tell you to solve \"15 to the power of 3\", but you only know how to do that because you were previously taught that \"X to the power of Y\" breaks down into the tasks of \"Multiply <em>X</em> by <em>X</em>, and do it <em>Y</em> times\"  [technically <em>Y</em>-1 times, but eh.]</p>\n\n<p>Much like your math classes, programmers have established a base of 'known' tasks so we don't need to focus on the details of the small things and can devote our time to solving the actual problems and not so much <em>how</em> to perform the underlying tasks-- we can now assume a computer understands how to do basic things.</p>\n",
            " <p>If it were me, I'd tell her that programming is about splitting a task into little tasks in a way that helps you solve them; and then expressing those little tasks in a language that can't be misunderstood by an idiot computer.  But you also have to do it in such a way that other programmers can understand it easily too -- and that's not the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>That is, on top of what everyone else has said...</p>\n",

No, not \"Hello World!\"</p>\n\n<p>What'd I'd do is say that there are many types of programming languages -- ones that make games, ones that control robots -- but what you're going to be working with is HTML.</p>\n\n<p>Make a web page with nothing on it, and then add an form that will send an email to her email address.  She presumably has a cell phone that is capable of notifying the owner that they have a new email, so you could tell her that it's a great way for her friends and family to contact her.  If she gets her own web site in the future, you can tell her that she can put the form on her web site, allowing her customers and business partners to contact her.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, if she's a little mischievous, I'll tell you what got me interested in programing: hacking.  Back in the day, I made the best program ever made for messing around on AOL (outside one program that outperformed mine in only one of the dozens of things that mine did) -- at the age of 14-15.  On the white hat side, I also made one of the first spam-removal programs as well (1995.)  I was able to make my online experience a lot more enjoyable, and we'll leave it at that.  Everything that I wanted to do on a computer was an adventure or puzzle that I had to figure out, and the things that I wanted to do on a computer were endless.  Sure, getting it to work was a headache at times, but writing a program that accomplished things better and faster than any human could, or doing things that were simply impossible to the general public, was like building a fine piece of machinery that one could be proud of.  Now, you probably out to shy away from anything serious, but it would be extremely easy to make something in Visual Basic that could be launched on start-up (sitting on the side of the screen or the system tray,) and from there, you could make it launch her favorite web sites, her favorite programs, etc.  You could introduce her to the commands needed to launch an exe and a web site, and then just ask her to make some buttons, then add the code to those buttons, putting in her favorite web sites (facebook, twitter, etc.) and programs (iTunes, word processor, etc.)  If her computer's in her room, you could also toss an alarm clock on it for added functionality.  Of course, 30 minutes is too short to walk her through that, so you'd have to already have it done.  At the end, you'd email a little 2-3 page user manual, the code, and the .exe to her... and then leave her with a little sales pitch: it's not easy at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's not so bad, will be extremely useful in life, and will help develop her analytical thinking.</p>\n",

And we gave him a bit of market research on potential suppliers, google-fueled stuff that must have felt pretty close to some of his school projects. At the moment he is working through a hands-on xhtml+css tutorial, which should allow him to edit some of our website next week.

            " <p>This is more of my personal experiences than a straightforward \"answer\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did I get interested?</strong>\nMy parents bought an IBM PC XT in 1984 (I was born in 1984). It has 640kb RAM and 20MB HDD and a 5\" FDD and ran MS-DOS v3.2. I was not allowed to touch it till I was in the 5th standard and when I was finally allowed to use it, I poured all my years of accumulated curiosity into it.</p>\n\n<p>My sister on the other hand was allowed that same PC and a Quadra 610 mackintosh whenever she wanted it and she paid as much heed to it as she paid to the table it was set on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Teaching my sister...</strong>\nI tried to teach my sister computer programming in BASIC. I made her to everything right from starting the computer to typing in the programme and executing it. It was a s line programme.</p>\n\n<pre><code>10 PRINT \"CAT\"\n20 END\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This took half an hour. When she finally executed it, it printed the word 'CAT' and she was furious. She had expected a picture of a cat to appear. She stormed out of the room and that was the end of programming forever!</p>\n\n<p>Moral: The output better be proportional to the time and efforts they put in.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Teaching high school kids Labview and Lego NXT</strong>\nI was a mentor for the <a href=\"http://www.usfirst.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">FIRST Robotics</a> for a year and had to guide the kids in programming the robot in NI Labview. Frankly, the programming skill required was much above the level of a high school kid. But the competition was intended to get kids excited about engineering and raise their bar on the ability of taking on a challenge. As long as the programmes had just an if statement and one loop, things were okay. People dropped out of the programming section of the robot when they saw the code diagram I had created for the robot we had built the previous year.</p>\n\n<p>As much as people are stating that 15 year olds can do complex things and can have attention span of hours, I found a strange lack of motivation in them to do so.

            " <h1>\nWhat is CS?\n</h1>\n\n<p>I think before you go into demos, it helps to briefly give your take on CS' place in the world. I liked Hal Abelson's description of CS relative to math: while math helps you describe the world in terms of laws, CS helps you describe how to do things. His example was the square root function: math will define it, but won't help you find it for any given input. CS will. At a lower level, electrical engineering and physics laid the groundwork for the hardware that enabled the internet, but left open the questions of how to get people using it. </p>\n\n<h1>What is it like to be a programmer?</h1>\n\n<p>Then there's the question of what it's like to be a programmer. What drew me to it was that it has a quicker turnaround of try-something, test it, fix it, than any other technical field. It's nonstop problem-solving, whereas in other fields the turnaround time for a single loop may be months. It's also useful to almost every other technical field, which is more than can be said for... most other technical fields. So if you don't know what you want to do yet (likely), it's a good thing to get good at early. In college, few things will make you more useful to more professors than being able to code up their experiments.</p>\n\n<h1>Eye candy, tied to code</h1>\n\n<p>Then of course, don't forget the demos. It might be cool to get a copy of quake (open-source), and make some one-line change (e.g. change the gravity strength) and recompile, for instance. Also have her look at the code. Reassure her that she shoudn't expect to understand much, it may seem like gibberish now, but then again, so do newspapers in foreign languages that she hasn't learned yet. You can say that nonetheless she can see that things are being assigned to things, objects are being told what to do, and here's where we set the gravity, etc. </p>\n",
            " <p>I used to teach 18 year old college students, and I suppose 15 year olds are about the same.\nDon't expect success without practice. It took me some weeks in my first class to get \"broken in\".</p>\n\n<p>The biggest thing I had to learn was that what I thought was so simple and obvious that I was afraid I couldn't fill the time was not at all that way to the students.\nI learned that you have to go in baby steps - otherwise it's just \"gee whiz\" magic.</p>\n\n<p>How you fit this in 30 minutes I'm not sure, but the first thing I did was show them a little home-made computer I had built, which was programmed to play a little tune by clicking a speaker in and out. I explained that it could play a note by decrementing a counter, to act as a delay, between clicks. I just wrote the pseudo-code on the board, just like a recipe. Then, there was a little capacitor that I could hook under a wire that would have the whole thing run about 1000 times slower. Then they could hear click - wait - click - wait ... Then when I unhooked the capacitor, it burst forth with the little tune.</p>\n\n<p>The point of this was to get across that computers only do simple things, and do them one at a time.\nThey don't start each step until the previous step is finished.\n(Yeah, yeah, I know - pipelining and all that, but we're talking to <em>newbies</em>.)\nIt's only electronic speed that makes them appear to do everything at once, which is what newbies tend to assume (along with mind-reading).\nThat is one of the really basic concepts without which you can't begin to understand programming and computers.\nTo us, this is so in-grained that we don't even realize that we know it,\nbut beginners don't know it.</p>\n",
            " <p>I started programming when I was 14. While most (47 of the 50 students who enrolled) either dropped out mid-year or just decided not to continue into the advanced course next year, I stuck with it and learned something very important:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming gives you the ability to create something from nothing.</strong> You have the power to turn words into a useful tool that fills a need, an entertaining activity for you and your friends, or just something you can show your friends and say, <em>\"Look what I did.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>We were taught \"Hello World\" to begin with, but <strong>I had no interest until I could make my code interact with the user</strong>. The moment we were taught to read input with \"cin\" I set out to make a Mad-Lib program that we could play in class. My first hurdle was reading input containing spaces, followed by formatting output. Later I wanted to be able to save these stories to a file and so I needed to learn file IO. <strong>Tackling obstacles to accomplish my own goals was what kept me engaged.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Later on in the year we discovered that the network admins were logging our use of \"Net send\" and the Novell SendMessage client that we had been using to communicate during computer class, and they disabled it after students used it to cheat on a test. So <strong>I wrote a chat room to replace the one the admins disabled. It was the first truly useful thing I had created.</strong> I modelled it after Battle.Net's chat system, complete with user registration, moderators and even a basic encryption and shadow-file system to prevent users from tampering (all of the files had to reside on a shared network drive in order for the students to access and use the program). <strong>These were not concepts I was already aware of, but solutions I came up with on my own to solve a problem. To me, that was the joy of programming.</strong></p>\n\n<p>So to answer the question properly, beyond the discussion of what it means to develop software, an interactive demo is probably a great idea. Preferably something that solves a problem she has, such as resizing all those giant pictures from her camera automatically. While a little more complicated, she might have fun with a simple leave-a-message web page that she can share with her friends. You could have it email someone any time a new message is posted, and have her edit the code to send it to her email instead of yours. Also, have the page show the last X number of comments, and get her to adjust that number as well, and see what the results are.</p>\n",
            " <p>Where I used to work we sometimes had work experience kids coming in.  Some were interested in computers, some weren't.  We used to get them to sit them in front of a computer and get them to write a guessing game.  (Computer randomly selects a number, user gets feedback on if their guess was too high/low.)  It's simple to do and it's genuinely a fun result.  Nothing is more powerful than showing them tangibly what THEY can create.</p>\n",
            " <p>When you want to get --and keep-- someone's attention, then ASK, don't TELL.  Ask how they would perform a simple task, such as getting a drink of water.  Then show them how following the instructions that they provided (Such as \"Go down the hall\") don't actually handle the problems of when to turn left, turn right, stop, etc.  Understanding and handling those boundary conditions, that's the business of programming!  Then you can show how a \"do-until\" loop can handle the \"walk until you come to the wall\" kind of situation, to make meta-tasks out of the one-foot-in-front-of-the-other task of walking.</p>\n",
            " <p>I'm not sure if this is a legend or a true story, but I was reading about why the lucky stiff one day. Part of a story was how he showed programming to a kid (or maybe even kids) he met on a train.<br>\nAs some of you might know, _why was a Ruby guy (and Ruby is, well, being quite friendly to regular humans). He was working on some game in Ruby, while some kid approached him to see what was he doing. He showed them the <strong>result</strong> first - the working game. Then, he showed the kid how he can <strong>modify</strong> things in code to change the result. Then he let the kid <strong>play</strong> with the code and see modified result.<br>\nI think that that should be your general workflow - result, modify, play. You should find some project (game would be the best choice) in human-friendly language and show it to the kid.</p>\n\n<p>As I've sad, I have no idea whether this story is true or not. It's still very cool.</p>\n\n<p>Also, one more thing. I remember my first experience with programming - <code>MessageBox</code> in Delphi. It was cool, because I could make computer do what I want and immediately see the result.<br>\nThen, microcontrollers appeared. They were even better, because my code could change the real world. I mean, assigning some value to variable stopped being so abstract, as it caused a voltage to appear on output port, which then caused my engine to move. It was cool. You may want to choose this way - show the kid something like Arduino.</p>\n\n<p>You see, I think <strong>it's all about changing and seeing the result.</strong></p>\n"

Keep in mind that 15 year olds are much easier to explain programming to than 50 year olds -- so you need not dumb things down or use far-fetched analogies.</p>\n\n<p>I usually start off with examples of what programs are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apps like iTunes, Photoshop, Chrome, and games including console games.</li>\n<li>OSes like Windows, Mac OS, iPhone's iOS, Android. (Trust me, they'll know what you're talking about.)</li>\n<li>Programs that crunch numbers or solve really complicated math problems -- weather simulations, biological simulations, calculating pi, AI, language processing etc.</li>\n<li>Most sophisticated websites involve programming too.</li>\n<li>Transit ticket vending machines and ATMs, microwave and fridge timers, car navigation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After that, I usually go on to explain that we code programs in a formal language that the computer can recognize, often typing them up in something as simple as Notepad. The languages look like a cross between math and English, describing concepts and giving formulas and instructions for the computer to follow.</p>\n\n<p>Then they usually ask if I'm on the computer all the time, if this is why I'm always on Facebook, and why my eyes haven't gone bad yet. Guys ask if I know how to \"hack people\", and girls ask if it's good money or how many girls there are in computer science classes.</p>\n\n<p>After that, if they're still interested, they usually start asking specific questions that are a lot easier to answer (or at least to Wiki): things like how you would make a game, how Windows Messenger works etc.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a computer around, you can show-and-tell some code -- something that would have tangible effects, like a button click handler from the settings dialog box in Firefox, the main loop or physics code in a game engine, some JavaScript source from a website etc..</p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p>This question is a follow up to my previous <a href=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/46913/writing-acceptance-test-cases\">question</a>, which was a bit general, so\nI shall be more specific with this one. </p>\n\n<p>I want to automate acceptance testing on a web application. Briefly, this application allows the user to create contracts for subscribers with two constraints:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You cannot create more than one contract for a subscriber.</li>\n<li>Once a contract is created, it cannot be deleted (from the UI).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let's say TestCreate is a test case with tests for the normal creation of a contract.</p>\n\n<p>The constraints have introduced complexities to the testing process, mainly dependencies between test cases and test executions.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Before we run TestCreate we need to make sure that the application is in a suitable state (the subscriber has no contract)</li>\n<li>If we run TestCreate twice, the second run will fail since the state of the application will have changed.</li>\n<li>So we need to revert back to the initial state (i.e. delete the contract), which is impossible to do from the UI.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>More generally, after each test case we should guarantee that the state is reverted back. And since, in this case, it is impossible to do it from the UI, how do you handle this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Possible solution</strong>: I thought about doing a backup of the database in the state that I desire, and after each test case, run a script which deletes the db and restores the backup. However, I find that to be too heavy to do for each single test case. In addition, what if some information are stored in files? or in multiple or unaccessible databases? </p>\n\n<p><strong>My question:</strong> In this situation, what would an experienced tester do to write automated and maintanable tests. Thank you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>More info</strong>: I'm trying to integrate tests into a BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) framework, which I find to be a neat solution for test documentation and communication, but it does not solve this particular problem (it even makes it harder)</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I'm currently working in a small company that its taking care of implementing lots of systems, most of them for goverment institutions, in witch it generally means taking software developted 20 years ago and refurbish them so fit up-to-date needs. The clients generally are very used to them and tend to discourage change (they are in their 50s 60s give or take, so not technologie-friendly in general).</p>\n\n<p>As you can imagine, dev-team in most cases starts taking care of relation with clients, generating the documentation needed in this cases (CU usually), assisting to weekly meets to see improvements with clients.</p>\n\n<p>As for experience, this is a gold mine for me, because gives a nice perspective on all the aspects of software development, but also some problems rise because, if developers come from mars then clients are from venus. There is a fine gap on the vocabulary/experience/capability-to-interpret-needs that generates a noise in the communication, and some times affecting the final product.</p>\n\n<p>Should a developer be in direct contact with the client, or there should be an \"adapter\" guy that translates client needs in pseudo formal requirements understandable to us?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>Developers should absolutely be in contact with the clients! Even if a business analyst writes a formal specification, its always beneficial to have access to the client to ask specific questions or get instant feedback on a feature you are working on. Business analysts are very helpful, but I would never want to work solely through them for requirements. Also, I would never want to wait more than a week or two to show off a feature to a client. Even if they make changes, its always easier to make a small change closer to the time of development rather than piling all the changes to the end of the project.</p>\n\n<p>Newer software methodologies are also geared toward bringing the client and the software development teams closer together. One of the main principles of Agile/Scrum is that the client be on the team and always be available for questions. Agile teams also demo their software after every sprint or iteration. Agile was formed under the assumption that software changes and that teams should be \"agile\" and adapt to changing business requirements.</p>\n",
            " <p>Always start with the client's perspective. E.g, Question: Why change something that works? Answer: Because the technology is in danger of no longer being supported and we may not be able to find developers facile in the technology in the near future.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid the urge to change something because you are enamored with a new technology. Just because they drive a 1967 VB Beetle and you are in love with a Prius, does not mean they see the need to change. Focus on their needs, not your wants.</p>\n",
            " <p>There are 2 sides to it. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>It is a great idea to be in direct contact with your client. You get invaluable experience as to how users in real life behave, their pain points, things that they want in the software and stuff you can do for them to get repeat business. </p></li>\n<li><p>It is also very important to have an adapter guy in this whole thing. Suppose you are doing the accounts software of some govt. agency would you not like to re-use part or whole of this software for another govt. agency too, perhaps one thats located in a different state? Of course you would, and thats where the adapter guy comes in. Its his/her job to map this software to the requirements and pain points of another related entity and ask developers to get the customizations done.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I think both approaches are needed, and complementary. </p>\n",

Since I can only retrieve items based on keys I couldn't actually use it for this scenario as far as Im aware.</p>\n\n<p>Is what I am trying to do bad use of a caching system? Should I try looking into NoSql DB which could possibly run as a cache for something like this to improve performance?

It's so easy to do: whenever I get the chance to think, my mind naturally wanders to work-related matters. I find so many of the other things in my day rather mentally unstimulating and as they say, nature abhors a vacuum. Unfortunately, constantly thinking about work is stressing me out and I can't seem to just flip that switch at the end of the day. It's been causing me quite a bit of insomnia.</p>\n\n<p>To make matters worse, nearly all of my friends are co-workers, and many of our conversations do very little to make me forget about the week. They're fun people to be around generally, and once we've had our bitch-fest we all stop talking about work, but suffice it to say it does little to encourage me to forget about work-related matters.</p>\n\n<p>So what can I do to leave my programming projects behind me at the end of the day?

            " <p>During my last project, I used to have the same problem. I was thinking about the code during my commutes to home, before going to sleep and even as I was alone in the room with my girlfriend.</p>\n<p>That's when I knew I had to stop.<br />\nI have pretty much figured it out now, and here's my advice to you.</p>\n<h2>Get Positive</h2>\n<p>First, accept that you can't just <em>stop</em> thinking about the work out of the blue. This is a <em>habit</em> you have acquired, and habits don't disappear at your immediate will.</p>\n<p>However you can start by <strong>reshaping your experience into a positive one</strong>.<br />\nConsider this example of negative thinking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don't know which database design is better. The deadline is coming next week and I feel I can't make the right decision at the moment. We can't afford to hesitate and If I fail now, I will be the one to blame.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This leads you nowhere.</p>\n<p>It may sound trivial but if you suspect you don't work well enough, or worse, procrastinate, your conscience will revenge on you. <strong>It's five times as hard to think about work when you feel like you fail at it</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you're in this kind of situation, there is something you can do about it <em>right now</em>.<br />\nEssentially, there are two points to add to your workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you have something <strong>to be proud of</strong> every evening.</li>\n<li>Make sure you have something <strong>you <em>strive</em> to work on</strong> every morning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ultimate goal of this is to <strong>switch your obsession to a positive tone</strong>. You know the feeling when you go to sleep thinking about <em>that awesome code you wrote in just about three hours that solved all the world's problems and made the bunnies happy</em>? You're still obsessed but now you've made a major and very important shift.</p>\n<h2>Get Productive</h2>\n<p>Once you're in the positive stream, you'll find it easier to effectively constrain your tasks to the working hours. Try to plan them in such way that <strong>thinking about the problems in your free time doesn't add any value</strong>. Consider this example of positive thinking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This database design problem is an interesting challenge and I'll try my best to solve it. I know I'm usually more productive in the afternoon so I'll just have some tea now and fix a couple of bugs so I can give it my full attention when I'm at my best. Before leaving, I'll evaluate my results, and if I don't make a considerable progress, next morning I will ask for some advice from the more experienced colleagues and post a question on StackOverflow as well. I'll make the final decision by tomorrow evening.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What has changed? Now you pick your challenges and organize your working time in a way that makes sense <em>to you</em>. These eight hours are not just eight hours in your life, they are <em>special</em>, and you need to take advantage of them. Specifically, you need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn these eight hours into <strong>the Perfect Time\u2122  for problem solving</strong>.</li>\n<li>Make sure that <em>physically</em> being in the office <strong>empowers you</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second point is a kind of trick you can play on yourself. Ask your company to provide you with the best hardware. Do you have <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/04/three-monitors-for-every-user.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">three monitors</a> yet? I keep my favorite teacup at work, and I just <em>love</em> my armchair. I'd never want to solve a problem without it again. Okay, I made up the armchair thingie but the point is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you learn how to get <em>really</em> productive at the office, you will see that <strong>the habit of bringing work home eventually fades because nothing really <em>justifies</em> it anymore</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Get a Life!</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a <strong>great answer by pydave</strong> that does a better job of suggesting after-job activities.<br />\nYou must <a href=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/98986/how-do-you-stop-yourself-from-bringing-work-home/99134#99134\">check it out</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, seriously.<br />\nThinking about a database late night? How about going to a club instead? Watching a movie?<br />\nIf you're not the type of person to know how to spend time, ask your friends to take you out.</p>\n<p>I can't possibly remember how many times I was initially resistant to my friends calling me somewhere and then realized what a great time it had been and how I could've easily missed it out of the passivity. Now, even when work-related thoughts are buzzing in my head, if somebody calls me in my spare time, I just say \u201cI'm in!\u201d and get going.</p>\n<p>A great relief comes when you realize <strong>you're still going to do what you love the next morning and there isn't a single reason to think about it right now</strong>. So go ahead and find something else to muse on!</p>\n<p>Even when you're in love, after some time, you stop thinking about your significant other every single hour. This would have exhausted you. Instead, you split your free hours so there is a time for her (or him), there is a time for your friends and there is a time for you to be alone.

So let's talk about activities.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What kind of mentally stimulating activites do you occupy your non-work hours with?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1>Board Games</h1>\n\n<p>Many modern board games are social, mentally stimulating, and fun to play. Games like Ticket To Ride and Dominion have great strategy elements that will engage your brain and my (ungeeky and nontechnical) friends and family are always surprised how much they enjoy them. They're popular among programmers, so you may already have interested coworkers.</p>\n\n<p>I'd recommend picking one up used (from craigslist, etc...) to give it a try. There's a <a href=\"https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/\">stackexchange site</a> if you have questions about what to get, but I'll give some basic recommendations. <a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BoardGameGeek</a> is a great site for reviews and understanding the game before you buy.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9209/ticket-to-ride\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ticket To Ride</a> - Competitive game where you build transit lines between cities on a board. Simple turn system that prevents long boring turns. Despite being initially skeptical, my family members (aunts, uncles, and cousins) really enjoyed this game. It feels simple like Monopoly, but there's a great deal more strategy and the game comes to a great climax.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13/the-settlers-of-catan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Settlers of Catan</a> - The classic starter game where you build up a settlement and barter with other players. Unlike Ticket To Ride, you directly interact with other players through bartering and can team up against each other. My nontechy sister really likes this game.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dominion</a> - It comes with a big box of cards and you play with a subset so each game can be different. Some will have no interaction with other players and others will be full of attacking others. It's essentially just a large deck of cards, so it travels well. My other less techy sister really likes this game.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37111/battlestar-galactica\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Battlestar Galactica</a> - This is not a beginner's game: The theme is geeky, the rulebook is quite long (for a board game), and a single game often takes hours. But it shows what board games can offer: it's a thematic experience that pits you against your fellow players and provides a great challenge that pits you against your friends. Battlestar Galactica will draw in fans of the show and plot knowledge adds to the game, but gives no advantage. You can work with the other players as a human or deceive them as a human-disguised robot. Human/robot designation is randomly chosen, so the game tests your guile and ability to exploit your friend's naivete.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Video Games</h1>\n\n<p>If you find movies not mentally stimulating enough, some games may give you what you want. Games like Portal, Half Life, Bioshock, Assassin's Creed, Uncharted, and Deadspace (<em>there are many others, but I happened to play these recently</em>) provide an interesting narrative, but require you to provide the action. (Some of those are playable on a powerful PC, but others require a game console.) There's lots of dumb action movie style games too, but I think they appeal more specifically to people already into games because they rely on continuous small rewards (like explosions, blood, and points) for your hand-eye coordination instead of creating a desire to progress the plot.</p>\n\n<p>Many people can't handle moving an avatar with a controller and mapping what they see on their 2D TV to a 3D environment, so you could also try some 2D adventure games.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Various games from <a href=\"http://www.telltalegames.com/games\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Telltale Games</a>: Monkey Island, Back to the Future, Jurassic Park. These still have a 3D environment, but the movement for most/all of them is much simpler and can be played with a mouse.</li>\n<li>Some classic adventure games are available as freeware on <a href=\"http://www.scummvm.org/downloads/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ScummVM</a> like Beneath a Steel Sky and Flight of the Amazon Queen. They're easy to install on Linux (check your package manager). These classic games and others like Monkey Island can also be purchased in the Apple AppStore. Many of these older games have somewhat obscure puzzles, but the iOS versions have a great hint system built in.</li>\n<li>There are also some modern 2D adventure games like <a href=\"http://machinarium.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Machinarium</a> and <a href=\"http://amanita-design.net/samorost-1/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Samorost</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For shorter nonnarrative experiences that also have simple controls, here are some interesting 2D puzzle games. Some of these games have a narrative, but the puzzle elements are more important.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://2dboy.com/games.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">World of Goo</a> - Build bridges to solve puzzles. Great visual style. Only quick mouse skills required.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://store.zachtronicsindustries.com/product/spacechem\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SpaceChem</a> - Visual programming to create molecule factories.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.braid-game.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Braid</a> - A platforming game (like Mario) that provides puzzles based on warping time in various ways. Requires some hand-eye coordination, but mostly brain.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Programming</h1>\n\n<p>One of the most obvious ways to stop thinking about work is to think about an equally challenging, but completely unrelated programming problem. If just thinking about programming is causing you problems, then this might not help. But personal projects should be about improving your skills and having fun, so it shouldn't cause you anxiety. (You should be really worried if it does ;)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Try making something useful (a plugin for a tool you use).</li>\n<li>Make something fun (a where's waldo game for your child/niece/cat).</li>\n<li>Learn a new <a href=\"http://diveintopython.org/getting_to_know_python/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">language</a>.</li>\n<li>Try making an <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Android</a> app (the free SDK includes an emulator so you don't need a device).</li>\n<li>Build a <a href=\"http://www.cherrypy.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">webapp</a>.</li>\n<li>Learn a new editor (and thus write a bunch of code to really understand it).</li>\n<li>Research and answer long-unanswered Stack Overflow <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=votes\">questions</a>. : )</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Learn Something New</h1>\n\n<p>Many universities offer their <a href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">coursework online</a> that are complete with lecture videos, slides, and assignments. If not to learn something, maybe discussion of \"<a href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/brain-and-cognitive-sciences/9-22j-a-clinical-approach-to-the-human-brain-fall-2006/lecture-notes/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the rate of neurogenesis in animals</a>\" will help with your insomnia. (Maybe disengaging your brain from something that causes anxiety to something you're ambivalent about will help you sleep. I don't know anything about insomnia, but you could <a href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/brain-and-cognitive-sciences/9-01-neuroscience-and-behavior-fall-2003/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">learn about that</a> too.)</p>\n\n<p>I'd recommend that you choose courses that won't make you think about work. You could try sciences that are completely new to you and unhelpful in your career. If that feels like a waste, Psychology or Economics may be applicable to work and still different enough that you can stay focused.</p>\n\n<h1>Literature</h1>\n\n<p>Read a book. Find some fiction that will keep you interested. I prefer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Asimov</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Clarke</a> to best-selling dramas because the latter leave me depressed.</p>\n\n<p>Write a story. Plan it out like software so you actually worry about the plot arcs for your characters and engage your brain. Participate in <a href=\"http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/whatisnano\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">National Novel Writing Month</a>.</p>\n",

        "sft_target": " <p>During my last project, I used to have the same problem. I was thinking about the code during my commutes to home, before going to sleep and even as I was alone in the room with my girlfriend.</p>\n<p>That's when I knew I had to stop.<br />\nI have pretty much figured it out now, and here's my advice to you.</p>\n<h2>Get Positive</h2>\n<p>First, accept that you can't just <em>stop</em> thinking about the work out of the blue. This is a <em>habit</em> you have acquired, and habits don't disappear at your immediate will.</p>\n<p>However you can start by <strong>reshaping your experience into a positive one</strong>.<br />\nConsider this example of negative thinking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don't know which database design is better. The deadline is coming next week and I feel I can't make the right decision at the moment. We can't afford to hesitate and If I fail now, I will be the one to blame.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This leads you nowhere.</p>\n<p>It may sound trivial but if you suspect you don't work well enough, or worse, procrastinate, your conscience will revenge on you. <strong>It's five times as hard to think about work when you feel like you fail at it</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you're in this kind of situation, there is something you can do about it <em>right now</em>.<br />\nEssentially, there are two points to add to your workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you have something <strong>to be proud of</strong> every evening.</li>\n<li>Make sure you have something <strong>you <em>strive</em> to work on</strong> every morning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ultimate goal of this is to <strong>switch your obsession to a positive tone</strong>. You know the feeling when you go to sleep thinking about <em>that awesome code you wrote in just about three hours that solved all the world's problems and made the bunnies happy</em>? You're still obsessed but now you've made a major and very important shift.</p>\n<h2>Get Productive</h2>\n<p>Once you're in the positive stream, you'll find it easier to effectively constrain your tasks to the working hours. Try to plan them in such way that <strong>thinking about the problems in your free time doesn't add any value</strong>. Consider this example of positive thinking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This database design problem is an interesting challenge and I'll try my best to solve it. I know I'm usually more productive in the afternoon so I'll just have some tea now and fix a couple of bugs so I can give it my full attention when I'm at my best. Before leaving, I'll evaluate my results, and if I don't make a considerable progress, next morning I will ask for some advice from the more experienced colleagues and post a question on StackOverflow as well. I'll make the final decision by tomorrow evening.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What has changed? Now you pick your challenges and organize your working time in a way that makes sense <em>to you</em>. These eight hours are not just eight hours in your life, they are <em>special</em>, and you need to take advantage of them. Specifically, you need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn these eight hours into <strong>the Perfect Time\u2122  for problem solving</strong>.</li>\n<li>Make sure that <em>physically</em> being in the office <strong>empowers you</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second point is a kind of trick you can play on yourself. Ask your company to provide you with the best hardware. Do you have <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/04/three-monitors-for-every-user.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">three monitors</a> yet? I keep my favorite teacup at work, and I just <em>love</em> my armchair. I'd never want to solve a problem without it again. Okay, I made up the armchair thingie but the point is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you learn how to get <em>really</em> productive at the office, you will see that <strong>the habit of bringing work home eventually fades because nothing really <em>justifies</em> it anymore</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Get a Life!</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a <strong>great answer by pydave</strong> that does a better job of suggesting after-job activities.<br />\nYou must <a href=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/98986/how-do-you-stop-yourself-from-bringing-work-home/99134#99134\">check it out</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, seriously.<br />\nThinking about a database late night? How about going to a club instead? Watching a movie?<br />\nIf you're not the type of person to know how to spend time, ask your friends to take you out.</p>\n<p>I can't possibly remember how many times I was initially resistant to my friends calling me somewhere and then realized what a great time it had been and how I could've easily missed it out of the passivity. Now, even when work-related thoughts are buzzing in my head, if somebody calls me in my spare time, I just say \u201cI'm in!\u201d and get going.</p>\n<p>A great relief comes when you realize <strong>you're still going to do what you love the next morning and there isn't a single reason to think about it right now</strong>. So go ahead and find something else to muse on!</p>\n<p>Even when you're in love, after some time, you stop thinking about your significant other every single hour. This would have exhausted you. Instead, you split your free hours so there is a time for her (or him), there is a time for your friends and there is a time for you to be alone. There is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't apply the same principle to work.</p>\n<p><strong>Divide and conquer!</strong></p>\n",

Engineer types are much more likely to get in and tinker with the user settings than, say, my Grandma playing solitaire on a Win98 machine.</p>\n\n<p>It also depends on what the application itself is.  If the point of the application is ease-of-use, you don't want to muddy that with a bunch of user-configurable options.  </p>\n\n<p>Too many configurable options makes an application seem overly complex.  If you create an application that has a lot of these options, I'd at least \"hide\" them in an \"Advanced...\" configuration screen or dialog, and only put a subset of things that the average user of that application will want to change on the \"regular\" options screen.</p>\n\n<p>Another alternative is \"skinning\" something.  That may mean the traditional \"skinning\" stuff (for example, the \"Appearance\" tab on Windows Display Properties), or it might mean a set of options that are set all at once (for example, the \"Themes\" tab on the same dialog).</p>\n",

That may be increased productivity or usability, or it may be some level of increased user satisfaction, but there should be some reason for doing it which justifies the effort involved.</p>\n\n<p>As someone who likes customisation, the questions you should ask yourself are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If I were paying, what would I pay for this level of customisation?  How many people like me are there?  And would that cover the cost of developing it?</p></li>\n<li><p>What do my competitors do?

In my experience, most users are not as comfortable using a computer as an IT person and will not customize even when given the option.</p>\n\n<p>If you are customizing in order to avoid doing a proper job of designing, you are customizing too much. If you are customizing because you like customization and not because it is a requirement, you are customizing too much. If you have a genuine requirement to customize, you should still question if it is a good idea and find out the underlying reason why they think they need customization. Often you will find a new requirement they hadn't mentioned if you use a requirement for customization as a place to start a dialogn with the person doing the requirements.</p>\n",
            " <p>I like to design for customisability, but before I get around to implementing it, I would prefer to get everything else really solid.

It may be they're happy with how the interface works and would rather have more features available rather than having enough customisability that they can change the position of buttons or menu items. </p>\n\n<p>I would rather have a really great interface that forces the user's hand a little, than have a lot of customisation going on, but wait an extra six months or year until my application can be released. <em>Shipping is a feature!</em></p>\n\n<p>The only definite exception to this is that if I am requiring keystroke combinations I would, in most cases, want to make those customisable, because you never know what else a user has running and it would be very irritating to collide with another application in a way that the user could not easily work around.</p>\n",
            " <p>A program is too customizable when any of the following is true:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>There are no reasonable out-of-the-box defaults for things.  Customizability is a lot more palatable if stuff works reasonably well even if you don't customize it.  For example, I hate vi because its out-of-the-box behavior in terms of what the backspace and arrow keys do is so different from the convention on the rest of the machine.  I know this can be customized away, but when I walk up to a stock machine it's basically unusable until I waste a bunch of time fiddling.</p></li>\n<li><p>You've made your program so customizable that its look and feel is effectively different on every machine, Linux distro, etc. and you effectively can't \"learn once, use everywhere\".  Again, see vi.</p></li>\n<li><p>You've built an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_platform\" rel=\"nofollow\">inner platform</a> such that the user would be better off just using the outer platform to accomplish what he/she wants.  For example, once a text editor or command line text processing tool gets too powerful, it's probably easier to just write a quick-and-dirty, ad-hoc Python script to do the more complex text manipulations than to learn how to do them using the inner platform.  Similarly, once a plotting library becomes too powerful, it's probably better to just let the user directly interact with the GUI library it's built on top of to customize the finer details of the plot.</p></li>\n</ol>\n",
            " <p>I generally don't bother.  I've had to work on a lot of different machines, and keeping them all customized would be more of a bother than it appears to be worth.  If I do customization on one machine, I'll be annoyed when another machine doesn't have it.  Making it easier to move customizations around would help somewhat (consider emacs users and their site-lisp files), but often I'd find that too much bother anyway.</p>\n\n<p>If your app won't work well out of the box, but needs to be customized, you've failed.</p>\n\n<p>I do want my favorite software on a machine, but I don't think that's what you mean by customization.</p>\n\n<p>One issue with customizability is that it's a promise to each and every customer that you have to respect.  You send out version A, and your customers customize.  All well and good.  Now, what do you do with version B?  If you break your customers' customizations, they'll be upset, and if you do it more than once, they'll be very reluctant to customize, so you'll be left with customization functionality that very few people use, along with annoyed customers.</p>\n\n<p>This means that you have to pay attention to what customization you've involved with each upgrade.  This may give you headaches, when you want to restructure something that should be easy to do, except that it would mess up customizations.  You have to pay attention to possible combinations of customizations that could interact badly.</p>\n",
            " <p><em>TL;DR: When your application becomes an intimidating framework.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>From the application developer's point of view</strong>, that's when customization would allow the application to break in such ways that support becomes impossible, either because the user is unable to report how he set up the application or because various settings interactions become too tortuous to make heads or tails. Think the customization system thoroughly and allow for information to get back to you in a meaningful way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>From the application user's point of view</strong>, that's when the user feels like setting up the application is daunting, often because it's akin to programming, for a loose definition of \"programming\" (This includes GUI-oriented programming or <em>Blinkenswitches</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Yes <strong>the line is a blur</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Yes sometimes a good code or GUI (re)design can make the application switch board <em>even with the same customizable feature set</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Create a <strong>learning curve</strong> between \"casual\", \"advanced\" and \"expert\" settings. It could go all the way to providing an API and/or scripting. All users are not starting on an equal foot: a tiered system will <strong>make each one feel at home</strong>. It can also create a sense of <strong>progress and achievement</strong> when a beginner switches from \"curated\" to \"advanced\".</p>\n\n<p>Good examples in various areas include Firefox (preferences, about:config, userchrome.css&amp;al.), Chrome (basic settings vs \"Under the hood\"), Mac OS X (pref panes, \"defaults(1)\", applescript/automator), or even Vim's vimrc. Bad examples include any application whose settings pane feels like a maze. I'm sure you could name half a dozen from the top of your head (unless they traumatized you into forgetting them).</p>\n",
            " <p>You could add the most basic and common sense configurations to a menu, so they can be directly tweaked from the user interface. Everything else, that is more complicated you can put into some configuration file or some other means that is accessible from a configuration tool or something.</p>\n\n<p>That way, your most common, unspecialized users have access to the basic configurations they need to use the app, while your more specialized, expert or otherwise more interested users, can use the extra configurations to suit their highly specialized needs.</p>\n\n<p>I think this is the best trade-off between having a user-friendly and highly customizable app. The success of this, though, is how you split the configurations.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I've collected a bunch of interview questions like \"Describe how you would design a photo album application\", \"Describe how you would design this particular feature of this particular website\" (e.g. likes on Facebook, recommendation on Amazon, shopping cart, game of black jack). Then, what if there are millions of this thing? What would you change?</p>\n\n<p>It looks like this is either expecting a database schema or a bunch of class definitions (or both?). I have learned about databases in school but I've never actually architected an application before and am having trouble knowing where to start, whether the designs I come up with are \"good\" and what I can change to make it scalable.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a general approach or thought process when designing these systems? And general issues/problems that seem to come up a lot in the design that I should try to avoid? Could someone maybe walk me through one (or preferably all, while comparing the needs of each) of these and explain:</p>\n\n<p>1) How do you come up with what entities are needed?\n2) How do you decide on what relationships everything will have?\n3) How do you incorporate performance optimization into your design?\n4) Do I do this using classes or databases? Does it make a difference (i.e. would I have a class that can't really be translated to a database table, for example?)</p>\n\n<p>The main reason I'm asking is because I was going through \"Cracking the Coding Interview\" and my answers were completely different from the author's - I had very different ideas of what classes were important.</p>\n\n<p><strong>MY ATTEMPT:</strong>\nWith the photo sharing app, I would have the classes/tables:\nPhoto and User for sure.</p>\n\n<p>Then, I think if we're trying to create a schema, there would be a table linking photo and user if we assume each person in the photo is linked to the photo (is this table necessary? If not, is it still common practice to have a separate table for many-to-many relationships or not?).</p>\n\n<p>But if we're trying to take an object oriented approach, maybe instead we'd have a class called album which does all the work and has all the info from the two other tables/classes. This is one thing I noticed in the book- there are a bunch of classes and then one class which basically has all the info and connects the other classes- is this common? For example, in my examples above, does this seem like it would apply?</p>\n\n<p>I'm just hoping for some general rules/guidelines to follow because right now I have no idea how to tell what a good architecture for a large system looks like.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

I only understand when it comes to pre-compiled vs runtime compiled. I understand defining data types like a constant in code is bound to be faster than letting the computer/language figure it out(like php or ruby), but when it comes to using C or Java what is it that makes C faster? Aren't they both going to be compiled into machine language in the most efficient way possible?</p>\n\n<p>To me, it seems as if the only difference between using a language like C or Java is; a higher level language like java would be easier to organise and write/maintain large applications with classes and inheritance. But I feel as if it should really make no difference when once it is compiled. Can someone explain?</p>\n\n<p>btw i only know higher level languages like php, java, ruby, vb, c#.

The extra step of a language like Java or C# having to executed the code inside a VM does add some overhead however in a lot of cases the overhead in negligible (there are certain tasks though that generally run faster in languages like ASM).</p>\n\n<p>One thing the VM have that negate the overhead of running the VM is that the VM can optimized the code for the system it is running on automatically.  With languages that compile code into machine code like C++, when you compile it, you generally try to target the compilation options for the most general settings so that the program performance is very similar on a large amount of systems.  C# and Java can take advantage of specific features of the system it is running on so that the program performs the best based on the system it is running on (with C++, you would have to compile the code for each system to take advantage of those features).</p>\n",

You're not writing code for a heavily constrained environment so you should write in a high level language and optimize (including writing the odd C module) as indicated by your profiler.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, since Java is not really a compiled language in the normal sense of the word, it makes a poor comparison to C. A more appropriate comparison would be between with another compiled language, like C++, Ada, D, Go, or even OCaml.</p>\n\n<p>Your conclusion about higher-level compiled languages being capable of being as fast as lower-level compiled languages is both right and wrong. At the limit, code can be optimized to do stuff as fast as possible. However, the sufficiently intelligent compiler is a myth. The fewer layers of abstraction between human-readable code and machine code, the more direct the translation. That means compilers don't have to be as smart, which means they can be better.</p>\n\n<p>That's not to say that a program written in C is automatically faster than one written in a much higher level language. The advantage you get from using high-level language features is that other (usually smarter) people have already thought about how to optimize what you're doing. So, for example, calling Python's built-in <code>sort</code> function on a Python list will get you better performance than if you had implemented bubble sort in C.</p>\n",
            " <p>Before you can determine that language X is more efficient than language Y, you need to know in which manner \"X is more efficient than Y\".</p>\n\n<p>Some languages are more efficient in run-time execution speed, some languages are more efficient in memory footprint, some are more efficient in lines of typed text.  Odds are there are efficiencies that you are concerned about and efficiencies that you could care less about.  Target the languages which have efficiencies you care about.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that a language is like a tool, your focus shouldn't be on how efficient the tool is, it should be on selecting the right tool for the job.  A nail gun is much more efficient than a hand held hammer for building a house's framing.  A nail gun is much less efficient than a hand held hammer for hanging a single picture frame.  Select the right tool for the job.</p>\n",
            " <p>A lot of time is spent by CPU designers, hardware system architects and compiler writers on beating some competitor's benchmark.  Historically, some of the most publicized benchmarks have been in Fortran and C.  So that's the type of code that has gotten optimized system wide.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the layers of abstraction often used to provide high level language features often have impacts at the hardware level, not only in the number of machine instructions, but in cache hit ratios, and branch prediction penalties.  These also can also potentially reduce performance, and are sometimes very difficult to optimize away without losing the safety of the HLL feature.</p>\n\n<p>Highly object oriented languages often encapsulate things so well that it is hard for a compiler to optimized globally, which removes another performance tool.</p>\n\n<p>That said, there can be a massive variation in the performance optimizations applied to any one language, from slow interpreters, to faster VMs, hot spot JITs, global JITs, trace-driven compilers, and other exotic compiling/parallelizing tricks.  Plus, there's Moore's law: e.g. I have slow interpreted Basic programs that now run faster than equivalent hand-coded C and assembly language did a couple decades ago.  So a lot of developers just use the language they are most familiar with, think they can best solve problems with, and wait for the hardware to catch up.  However this thinking does have other impacts, including adding to the energy and pollution costs of global computing.  Some people think the latter does matter.</p>\n",
            " <p><strong>A concrete example</strong>: Let's take the following code fragment:</p>\n\n<pre><code>x.Run()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is a call to the <code>Run</code> method.  In machine code, this might look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$a0 = x                       // Use $a0/$a1 for argument passing\n$r1 = [address of Run method]\ncall $r1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>[address of Run method]</code> is the tricky part.  In a statically typed OO language like Java or C++, we'd look it up in the virtual method table (VMT), which is an array of method addresses.  At compile time, we may know that <code>Run</code> is the 2nd entry in the VMT, so we can load it from offset 4 (on a 32-bit machine):</p>\n\n<pre><code>$a0 = load x\n$r2 = load $a0+0   // The VMT is the first address in the object\n$r1 = load $r2+4   // Load the 2nd address from the VMT\ncall $r1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In a language like Python, an object's method table is some kind of string-to-address lookup data structure, possibly a hashtable, requiring a call to a <code>lookup</code> function first.  The machine code might look something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$a0 = x\n$a0 = load $a0     // Load the address of the method hashtable\n$a1 = \"Run\"\n$v0 = call lookup  // Expensive operation\n$a0 = x\ncall $v0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So even though you're doing \"the same thing\" in both languages, the static typing in C++ and Java lets the compiler produce smaller, faster machine code.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: There are ways to speed things up.  For example, you can do whole-program analysis of Python code to try and determine the address of the Run method at compile time, which would get rid of the hashtable lookup in some cases.  But the point of my example was to demonstrate where the performance difference can come from even though you're \"compiling to machine code\" in both cases.</p>\n",
            " <p>While performance is really a result of implementation rather than languages, there are, in practice, faster and slower languages.</p>\n\n<p>C is usually the fastest in comparisons.

If you created the comments branch from blog_posts and meant to create it from dev, merging dev into the comments branch results in a fast forward merge if no commits were added to the comments branch.</p>\n\n<p>If you added commits to the comments branch you can just merge dev into comments and move on with your life.

Don't sweat this decision too much given the situation you described. The two branches don't seem like they have diverged that much, so the risk of totally screwing up the code base is minimal.</p>\n"

You'll be making the allocator do the work of tracking down the memory and marking it as unused, despite the fact that the OS can free the memory in one fell swoop. As <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20120105-00/?p=8683\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Raymond Chen points out</a>, if the amount of memory to be freed at program exit is large, the time wasted can be significant.</p>\n<p>However, this behavior is still OS-dependent. With respect to <em>the language</em>, it is <em>always</em> wrong to not free memory. More importantly, tools like lint or Valgrind will report this as an error, and if you get used to ignoring their errors you defeat the purpose of using them. So I'd treat the practice of not freeing at program exit as an optimization, and you shouldn't optimize prematurely.</p>\n<p>If we're not talking about program exit, failing to <code>free</code> is most definitely a bug.

I had a service that (sort of) managed <em>deals</em> and another service that managed <em>transactions</em>.</p>\n<p>when calling GET deals, it populated transaction information by calling the transactions service</p>\n<p>However, I got a new product requirement that when creating a transaction, I also wanted to make sure it got attached to a deal.</p>\n<p>I could have added logic in the transactions service to call the deals service to make sure the txn gets attached automatically but this would lead to a cyclic dependency.</p>\n<p>The way around this I found was that I could use event emitters. When a transaction is created, I could emit an event that a transaction was created. Then in the deals server I could make a subscriber that watches for this event and creates a deal and links that transaction ID.</p>\n<p>Through this pattern, the transactions microservice will never have to depend on the deals service.</p>\n",

Compare this with your solution, which cycles through all of the numbers from 1 to <code>foldl lcm [1..20]</code>. If you try with 30, the difference between the runtimes will be even greater.</p>\n\n<p>Take a look at complexities: your algorithm has <code>O(ans*N)</code> runtime, where <code>ans</code> is the answer and <code>N</code> is the number up to which you are checking for divisibility (20 in your case).<br>\nThe other algorithm executes <code>N</code> times <code>lcm</code>, however <code>lcm(a,b) = a*b/gcd(a,b)</code>, and GCD has complexity <code>O(log(max(a,b)))</code>. Therefore the second algorithm has complexity <code>O(N*log(ans))</code>. You can judge for yourself which is faster.</p>\n\n<p>So, to summarize:<br>\n<strong>Your problem is your algorithm, not the language.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Note that there are specialized languages that are both functional and focused on math-heavy programs, like Mathematica, which for math-focused problems is probably faster than almost anything else. It has a very optimized library of functions, and it supports the functional paradigm (admittedly it also supports imperative programming).</p>\n",
            " <p>My first thought was that only numbers divisible by all primes &lt;= 20 will be divisible by all numbers less than 20.  So you only need to consider numbers that are multiples of 2*3*5*7*11*13*17*19.  Such a solution checks 1/9,699,690 as many numbers as the brute-force approach.  But your fast-Haskell solution does better than that.</p>\n\n<p>If I understand the \"fast Haskell\" solution, it uses foldl1 to apply the lcm (least common multiple) function to the list of numbers from 1 to 20.  So it would apply lcm 1 2, yielding 2.  Then lcm 2 3 yielding 6.  Then lcm 6 4 yielding 12, and so on.  In this way, the lcm function is only called 19 times to yield your answer.  In Big O notation, that's O(n-1) operations to arrive at a solution.</p>\n\n<p>Your slow-Haskell solution goes through the numbers 1-20 for every number from 1 to your solution.  If we call solution s, then the slow-Haskell solution performs O(s * n) operations.  We already know that s is over 9 million, so that probably explains the slowness.  Even if all shortcuts and gets an average of half-way through the list of numbers 1-20, that's still only O(s * n/2).</p>\n\n<p>Calling <code>head</code> does not save you from doing these calculations, they have to be done in order to calculate the first solution.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks, this was an interesting question.  It really stretched my Haskell knowledge.  I wouldn't be able to answer it at all if I hadn't studied algorithms last fall.</p>\n",

Typically on my team we create separate projects for BLL (business rules), Model (DTOs and ASP.NET model classes), and Data ( typically Db and WS I/O ).</p>\n\n<p>My question is in regards to what teams do for classes that access services.  Typically in our Data project we postpend 'Dao' to the class name that queries the objects in the Db.  So for example a class that does CRUD operations in a Db on Foo objects we typically name FooDao.cs and there seems to be general consensus on the team for that pattern.  But what do teams do for classes that query webservices?  Sometimes we name them as FooFacade.cs, or FooSvcClient, or even FooSvc.  </p>\n\n<p>I understand there probably isn't a true right or wrong answer here, but I want to know what others do, and if there is momentum towards a particular approach. </p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

This may include security, reliability, availability, resilience, capacity, performance, robustness and other such requirements from a user point of view).</p>\n\n<p>This is the first pass at what the system must do, the very start of serious thinking.</p></li>\n<li><p>System architect</p>\n\n<p>This person produces the high level technical framework within which to work. They give the outline match plan. The general tools, techniques, constructs. They break down the whole system into smaller components, how they fit with one another, how they fit with the outside world...</p>\n\n<p>This helps in many ways refine what needs to be thought about. Very often problems will be discovered at that stage about the requirements as written by the business analyst. Back to them for some iterations to improve their understanding of what they want and their expression of it.</p></li>\n<li><p>System designer</p>\n\n<p>This role is about how to make it all work. This might be more team work than a one-man show. But there is likely a lead designer to oversee the whole system design. This person must dig into the detail and make sure the architect's view is something that can actually be built.</p>\n\n<p>Expect further refining of the architecture of the system, and therefore potentially of the business analysis.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tests manager</p>\n\n<p>This role is very often forgotten. But at the end of the day if you can't test it, how can you prove that you can build it? There must be a review of the results of all stages : business analysis, architecture and design by someone competent in testing who will be able to highlight deficiencies and therefore enable early corrections, way before any code gets written.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That's a short summary.</p>\n\n<p>Those guys/gals are only the general run of the mill people in the chain to think about what must be thought about.</p>\n\n<p>For complex projects such as large banking or space applications just to take two examples (think many hundreds to many thousands of man-days), there are many subject matter experts as we call them to review and support projects at every stage. These roles include security analysis, system sizing, capacity, performance, databases, clustering, and many other such narrow areas of expertise, including precise business areas. The variety of roles depends on the size and complexity of systems.</p>\n\n<p>All that to say that you should not try and know it all, you won't. You can however get a grasp of the overall picture and on small projects you can delve into much more than on large projects, simply because the level of complexity allows you to be more rounded.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to know how to design systems, then you need to start asking questions by thinking outside the box. Put yourself enough in the customer's shoes and try and think what could go wrong, what needs testing. Then get together with a real customer and push them to explain the extents and limits of the system they envision they need. Plus whenever I say 'customer', you must understand that this encompasses several very different people. There's the person who uses the system day in day out for what it was designed to do. There's the operator, technical support, the manager who needs some report or other, the auditor, the infrastructure team, the stakeholder who paid for it, the quality manager who needs means to test your system... Ask all of them (and if they are one person, ask them to put all these hats on one at a time), so ask them all what they need and you will have a good start at knowing what your system requirements are. From there you can derive the architecture, and from there the design.</p>\n\n<p>For complex systems (whether software only or to integrate with hardware in the most generic sense) not only is one person not enough for each of the four roles I listed above, but you need to project-manage even the definition of what the system must do, let alone the other phases.</p>\n\n<p>HPH,\nasm.</p>\n",
            " <p>The best way to learn how to do anything is to do it. If you want to learn how to speak French, you have to speak French, and read French and write French and read about French and go to France and talk to French people in French. If you want to know how to play the piano, you have to actually play the piano. You have to play simple songs and learn the structure of the piano, and the structure of music. You have to learn how to read music, and how to express music through a piano using your fingers. You have to learn what music sounds like and what kinds of sounds a piano can make versus what a guitar or a flute or a saxophone can do. </p>\n\n<p>Programming is exactly the same. If you to know how to design a database, you have to design databases. If you want to understand cryptography, implement cryptographic algorithms and cryptographic protocols. If you want to write software that can serve multiple users simultaneously you have to understand how disk IO, network IO and threads work. To understand how that works you have write code that reads and writes from files, transmits data across a network, and synchronizes access to resources. All of that requires practice.</p>\n\n<p>A \"system\" is, generally, just a collection of stuff. Pieces that coordinate to form a whole. To build something big, you have to build a bunch of small parts. So, if you want to learn how to build systems, just start building systems. Take a problem, break down into pieces, and implement each piece one by one. Eventually you'll have an integrated \"system\". You'll probably fail a few times along the way, but that's ok. If you aren't failing it usually means you aren't trying hard enough.</p>\n\n<p>Also,  I would recommend going to school to study Computer Science. That won't help too much with the \"practice\" part. You'll have to do that on your own, but it will help with the exposure part. You'll learn a lot, about pretty much everything related to how computers, and computer systems work, which is hard to learn on your own.</p>\n"

This (IMHO) is a return to the \"wild-west\" of Software Engineering of the early days.</p>\n\n<p>This has led to Andrew's Law of Project Management:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We don't have time/budget/resources to do it right the first time, but\n  we'll find the time/budget/resources to do it a second (and probably a\n  third) time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
            " <p>In an ideal world, requirements must be as complete as possible, and there would be no deviation from expectations, since all expectations would be translated into requirements.</p>\n\n<p>In the real world, on the other hand, requirements are often incomplete, which makes room to unwritten expectations. Examples:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>An application takes ten minutes to do the simplest task, making it totally unusable (see the answer of David Schwartz above).</p></li>\n<li><p>An application has blue buttons, while the stakeholder hates blue and her favorite color is yellow.</p></li>\n<li><p>All user's passwords are stored in plain text and shown to everyone who goes through \"Forgot my password\" procedure.</p></li>\n<li><p>The visual design sucks.</p></li>\n<li><p>The application sends sensitive information back to the developer. The developer also has a back door access to the application, letting him to do whatever he want.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You notice that <strong>some expectations are very easily translated into requirements</strong>. For example, the first one can be verified with a simple non-functional requirement related to performance:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The loading of [...] performs 85% of the time below 500 ms. when tested on machine with the performances specified in appendix G part 2 and the load below 15% for the CPU, below 40% for memory and no active R/W disk operations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Others need not one, but several requirements</strong>. For example, the third one cannot be expressed as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The system is secure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>or:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Passwords are stored in a secure way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>since both are not the requirements: they are not precise enough and are subject to interpretation; they cannot be objectively tested. This means that you would need a requirement about the hashing algorithm, and several requirements about how \"Forgot my password\" procedure works by generating a password with a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator, then sending it by email.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Also, some expectations are close to objectiveness then others.</strong> At least, most people would agree that the fifth example illustrates something harmful: a developer doesn't have to have a full access to sensitive information, especially when he doesn't work on the project any longer. The same is not true for the point 4, and even more for the point 2: favorite color is something personal and cannot be a reasonable unwritten expectation for a project.</p>\n\n<p>The objectiveness answers your question \"[The] stakeholder could see a bug everywhere as he expected it to be like this or that..So how can I really know?\":</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>If most people would have the same expectation for the same product, then you may want to implement the expectation.</strong> If you saved all the passwords plain text, it's up to you to correct this and to support the cost of the consequences. If, on the other hand, you hashed them with SHA512, but didn't use the salt, the stakeholder wouldn't be able declare this as a bug just because she expected PBKDF2 to be used instead.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>If different people would have different opinions, then the stakeholder should have written more complete requirements</strong>, since you couldn't possibly know the taste of the stakeholder.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Note: remember to make the difference between <strong>common sense expectations</strong> and <strong>common practice expectations</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Some requirements are often omitted because they would cover a common practice, expected from any decent developer. Deviating from those practices, justifying it by the fact that there are no requirements, would be unprofessional. For example, I don't see a need to specify that a website must have no SQL Injection, unless I work with very inexperienced programmers.</p>\n\n<p>Why those requirements are omitted? Because it would be to expensive to describe everything. Do we need to tell that a web application should use HTTP? Do we need to tell that it must use a database? Or that you don't save 1 GB-length files in a RDBMS, unless you use FILESTREAM feature of Microsoft SQL Server?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Example of a common sense expectation: \"A website should be accessed from anywhere, not just from localhost.\" Well, yeah, that's what websites are for.</p></li>\n<li><p>Example of a common practice expectation: \"A website should use HTML 4, HTML 5 or XHTML.\" In fact, written from scratch HTML 3 websites are quite rare those days.</p></li>\n</ul>\n",

I've already declared that a is an A.  If I want to know the compile-time type of a, I only have to look in one place, at the declaration.  While I acknowledge that the implementation is relatively simple (use the code substitution you describe in your question), this also argues in favor of not implementing the feature; it's easy for coders to do it, too.</p>\n<p>The truly horrifying thing is that the type of a variable can magically change immediately after a <code>}</code>.

            " <p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Concurrency Issues</p>\n\n<p>When you write <code>A a;</code> you are effectively making the statement \"<code>a</code> is a variable that can contain objects representable by the type <code>A</code>\". By changing the variable's type to something lower in the food chain, you would potentially introduce concurrency issues.</p>\n\n<p>For example</p>\n\n<pre><code>namespace AsIf\n{\nclass A { public void FA() {} }\nclass B : A { public void FB() {} }\nclass C : A { public void FC() {} }\n\nclass Program\n{\ndelegate void ActionOnA(ref A a);\nstatic void AToC(ref A a) { Thread.Sleep(5000); a = new C(); }\n\nvoid main()\n{\nA a = new B();\n\n// Wait 5 seconds, change a to new C()\nActionOnA action = AToC;\naction.BeginInvoke(ref a, (ar) =&gt; { action.EndInvoke(ref a, ar); }, null);\n\nif(a is B)\n{\n// a is implicitly retyped as B for the rest of this block\n\n// B.FB get called on a (an instance of B)\na.FB();\n// Sleep 6 seconds\nThread.Sleep(6000);\n// B.FB gets called on a (an instance of C)\na.FB();\n// 'Undefined behaviour' most likely causing all kinds of crazy\n}\n}\n}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is slightly less likely to happen when you introduce <code>b</code> </p>\n\n<pre><code>// assume everything else is as before\n\nvoid main()\n{\nA a = new B();\n\n// Wait 5 seconds, change a to new C()\nActionOnA action = AToC;\naction.BeginInvoke(ref a, (ar) =&gt; { action.EndInvoke(ref a, ar); }, null);\n\nif(a is B)\n{\n// introduce b\nB b = (B)a;\n\n// B.FB get called on b (an instance of B)\nb.FB();\n// Sleep 6 seconds\nThread.Sleep(6000);\n// B.FB gets called on b (an instance of B)\nb.FB();\n// Safe! (for now)\n}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is because <code>B</code> is an entirely different variable being used to hold the same object.\nWhat the concurrent function is actually doing is assigning to the variable a which is not directly affecting the object a was holding. Because b now holds a reference to the object that was in <code>a</code>, a can get reassigned and nobody would care.</p>\n\n<p>Of course this is an implementation detail. If the compiler were to secretly create a second variable for the <code>asif</code> block rather than just reinterpreting a as being of the type <code>B</code>, the result would be effectively the same as my second example. Whether such behaviour is expected, obvious or desired is a different matter entirely.</p>\n\n<p>It's not an impossible feature, it's just one that's more work than it's worth really.</p>\n",

For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void switchOnEnumTypes(Foo|Bar|Baz var) {\n    switch(var)\n    case (is Foo) {\n        print(\"FOO\");\n    }\n    case (is Bar) {\n        print(\"BAR\");\n    }\n    case (is Baz) {\n        print(\"BAZ\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1 - Actually, it requires this, since Ceylon doesn't have an explicit type-cast.

            " <p>This is already a common feature in many programming languages. They are called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union\" rel=\"nofollow\">sum types</a>. Classes are an awkward way to simulate sum types in languages that lack them.</p>\n\n<p>Sum types (also called <em>variants</em> and <em>unions</em>)  are the dual to product types (commonly called <em>tuples</em>).  Just as product types allow you to stick to types together to create a compound type that is composed of type 1 and type 2, sum types allow you to create a compound type that is <em>either</em> type 1 <em>or</em> type 2.</p>\n\n<p>Here's how it works. Let's say we want to represent internet addresses. There are two ways to address a computer on the internet: using its IP address or its fully-qualified domain name (FQDN). The FQDN is a human-readable string, while the IP address is an integer between 0 and 2^32. </p>\n\n<p>Since we want functions that can operate on either of these schemes, we create a sum type</p>\n\n<pre><code>type InternetAddress = IP of int | FQDN of string\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that <code>InternetAddress</code> is really just a type alias for <code>int + string</code>. The identifiers <code>IP</code> and <code>FQDN</code> serve as labels (also called <em>constructors</em> or <em>injections</em>) for each \"branch\".</p>\n\n<p>To create a value of type <code>InternetAddress</code>, we <em>inject</em> a value into the sum type</p>\n\n<pre><code>val my_address: InternetAddress = FQDN \"mydomain.com\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To use a value of a sum type, we perform case analysis. The instance type of the value determines which \"branch\" of the expression we take:</p>\n\n<pre><code>case my_address of\n     IP ip_address -&gt; *branch 1*\n     | FQDN host_name -&gt; *branch 2*\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In either branch, the underlying value of <code>my_address</code> binds to the declared variable. So in branch 1, we can use <code>ip_address</code> which has type <code>int</code>, and in branch 2 we can use <code>host_name</code> which has type <code>string</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, sum types are an indispensable feature of programming languages, and the fact that they are so scarce in today's mainstream languages has caused considerable confusion and errors over the years.</p>\n",
            " <p>In Swift you write:</p>\n<pre><code>if let b = a as? B {\n    ....\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>a as B</code> would try to convert <code>a</code> to type <code>B</code> - which for object types would succeed if a actually belongs to class <code>B</code> which would need to be a subclass or superclass of <code>A</code> to ever succeed. Of course this would only change the type of the reference, not the type of the object behind it. And it would crash on purpose if the conversion fails.</p>\n<p><code>a as? B</code> is similar except it returns an &quot;optional B&quot;; the result is <code>nil</code> if the conversion fails.</p>\n<p><code>if let b = a as? B</code> evaluates <code>a as? B</code>. If the result is <code>nil</code> then the if is not executed. If the result is not <code>nil</code> then it assigns the reference to a non-optional <code>b</code> of type <code>B</code> and executes the <code>if</code>'s body.</p>\n"

            " <blockquote>\n<p>Can I conduct quiz among my team to evaluate their understanding? Is\nthis ethically correct thing to do so?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is it ethical? Most likely yes, but why reinvent the wheel?</p>\n<p>Just follow the PIP (Personal Improvement Plan) protocol outlined by your HR department. You already have one suspect in mind, so that means you've already caught one person not knowing what they're doing.</p>\n<p>That's great. Now draft a PIP for that person. List the basic topic(s) that this person seemed to be deficient in. Then, list all the topics you expect that person to already be proficient in. Assign a deadline for that person to catch up and be tested on. Then, ask HR, plus anyone else who might be involved in the firing decision, to double-check the PIP before you give it out to the employee in question.</p>\n<p>If the employee has a problem with the PIP, he'll tell you what it is. But if he doesn't have a problem with it, he'll sign it.</p>\n<p>Once the deadline arrives, then quiz that person privately yourself (or with HR or with a manager present). Testing someone privately will help them save face in front of their colleagues. Also, testing one person is a lot easier than testing multiple people. If you test multiple people, chances are high that they'll help each other cheat on the quiz.</p>\n<p>Not to mention, if you have multiple people on your team, chances are that those multiple people don't have the same titles and don't have the same salaries, and it wouldn't make sense to use the same standard or the same questions to test all of them either.</p>\n<p>Also, if you test team members that don't need to be tested, you risk antagonizing the entire team. After all, it shouldn't be that hard to find the clueless members of a team if you scrutinize their pull requests or their work products long enough, or if you just talk to each of them.</p>\n",
            " <p>Rather than test them, run micro-training sessions with them, on the topics where you see problems.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>remind them that everyone has to file a bug report when the find a bug - that is mandatory;</li>\n<li>remind them that peer reviewes are mandatory;</li>\n<li>explain again what process is expected to apply when doing XYZ task.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During these micro-trainings, provide the information from the company's processes, and remind the team where they can find the said processes, to refresh their knowledge when needed.</p>\n<p>If you notice that some person(s) continues to underperform in spite of the micro-trainings, do the following IN ORDER:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Have a discussion with the person (or each person); do not have a group chat; try to understand where is the problem, try to find a solution together with them;</li>\n<li>If the first step still fails, talk to their managers and agree to a course of action.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p>When you notice a problem and you take a corrective action, it is your job to handle that specific problem.</p>\n<p>When you apply tests, you will create tension in the team, when they rank according to the test results.</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p><strong>Background / current role:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm a software engineer and I've been working almost alone on a project which has an impact on the whole company (big company 10,000+ employees). The project has been resumed after a few years of inactivity with plenty of tech debt. It's extremely hard to do estimations because almost daily I discover something bad which delays me.</p>\n\n<p>Two months ago I asked my manager if somebody else could help me on this project, and my manager assigned another engineer to this project. Then he asked me for estimations and it was estimated that this project would be completed in mid January (with 2.5 people assigned).</p>\n\n<p>In practice this very talented engineer in the last month has managed to work on this project only one week, due to being busy with some other tasks (manager knows about it).</p>\n\n<p><strong>My situation with the temporary internal role:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I just managed to get an informal offer for temporary position in a different department of my company -- the position will last until mid May next year.</p>\n\n<p>Now, when I went to my manager to tell him that I would like to start with the temporary position in the other department he told me that he wants me to finish my project first.</p>\n\n<p>The project isn't going smoothly both for its nature and lack of resources, so I doubt I'm going to complete it by mid January -- as things are now, February or March are a better guess.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>\n\n<p>My manager would like to keep me on this project until it's done. While the temporary position is only until mid May.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if the start date is too late, they might not be interested in me anymore.</p>\n\n<p>If anything goes wrong I'm very tempted to resign, but again the problem is that I would be still stuck in this role for the three months of notice. The relationship is definitely compromised.</p>\n\n<p>I am looking for suggestions on how to proceed in this situation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To Consider:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>My manager does not gain anything from me moving to the temp role;</li>\n<li>I'd like to stay with this company because every few months there are good positions available in other departments.

I understand the value of providing support if you have a booth or someone in your organization is presenting.  But I am specifically talking about shows where the company has no real stake like this in the show.  The employees would have the sole role of attendee.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any thing gained by the business when sending its workers to a (comparatively) less expensive trade shows rather than focusing on practical training classes?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>One previous employer would routinely send QA and developers to tradeshows where the company had a booth. One of the difficulties with \"shrinkwrap\" business software is that the folks writing the software don't always know their customers (in this case, accountants and actuaries). So for this company, it was helpful to get the techies out to learn how the users actually used the product. </p>\n",
            " <p>I think it is a question of the complexity of your product. If you have a technically very complex product, non-marketing personell should be usefull as a backup in discussions where the marketing people are out of their depth. </p>\n",
            " <p>Of course there is business value to sending employees to conferences!</p>\n\n<p>This is especially true if someone in your org presents a talk, but even if they go to schmooze with counterparts from other companies and bond with coworkers, it is still worth it and not just for marketing types. <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html\">Java one</a> isn't only marketing, nor is <a href=\"http://velocityconf.com/velocity2012\">Velocity</a>, nor is <a href=\"http://www.eclipsecon.org/2012/\">EclipseCon</a>. These are opportunities for folks to see the state-of-the-art, interact with the top practitioners in their field and become excited about what they're doing by sharing ideas with others.</p>\n\n<p>I can understand why a beancounter (not saying Chad is one) might disagree. It is fashionable in the current economic environment to attempt to calculate an explicit ROI for every expenditure. <strong>The problem is that you just can't compute the business value of an intellectually engaged happy employee who mingles somewhat regularly with a wide range of professionals.</strong> Some people will simply add up the hotel, plane, per-diem, and missing days of work and see a cost-sink. That's not right. </p>\n",
            " <p>One advantage of sending a representative from your technical team to \"buying\" conferences (where you're looking at products others are trying to sell rather than hawking your own wares) that hasn't been mentioned is that they have the opportunity to intercept snap decisions that are occasionally made by executives who attend these shows and fall for the glitz and glamor that typically surround the presentations.  </p>\n\n<p>Having someone close at hand to whisper in their ears can prevent costly mistakes and lost time investigating solutions that would never have been considered if the right questions had been asked at the conference.</p>\n\n<p>I imagine other sections of the business would have similar advantages in their own areas of expertise.</p>\n",
            " <p>I am sure there are more but these are two that I can think of without too much effort:</p>\n\n<p>If you are in industries where the technology changes a lot (e.g. software), you get more value from a good trade show talking to the technicians than attending training classes. </p>\n\n<p>This is mainly because training courses by nature only focus on non cutting edge stuff and you get more done by talking to the developers instead. Shows give you the chance to get in depth information from the horses mouth, which can be invaluable.</p>\n\n<p>Or,</p>\n\n<p>If you are in product development of any sort, you generally get more from trade shows as well. In this day and age, technology know-how is often secondary to having great ideas that can act as differentiators for your company's products.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say you already know how to design cars relatively well. Your time is better served by seeing what the other people are doing at trade shows instead of learning another design skill in a classroom where exposure is limited. </p>\n\n<p>You may not learn how to design faster, or quicker, or in the latest fashionable way at trade shows but what you get is the chance to pick up on new ideas and a head start on  designing the RIGHT product in the first place. </p>\n\n<p>That in itself is infinitely more valuable.</p>\n",
            " <blockquote>\n  <p>However unless you are in marketing I fail to see any value gained by the business in having other workers attend the trade shows.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, <strong>small companies and startups</strong>, fighting for their existence, may need to send non-marketing people to trade shows. Here's why:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A small company should send a <a href=\"http://m.urbandictionary.com/#define?term=smokeshow\">smokeshow</a> to a trade show to stand at the company's booth and attract foot traffic. [In a small company, this person may or may not work in marketing.]</li>\n<li>A small company needs somebody with \"tech credibility\" to attend trade shows to converse with prospective customers, listen to their business problems, and establish the company's product as a solution to their problems. Sometimes a founder, a marketing person, or a salesperson has enough tech credibility to fill these needs, but not always. [This is also why larger companies sometimes hire pre-sales engineers.]</li>\n<li>While I agree that product managers and lead programmers are generally more useful at the workplace, building the product, they too can capture some value at trade shows. When a product manager or lead programmer understands what the marketplace demands, at a deep level, they can exercise superb judgement on requirements decisions. They can gain insight that will help them steer the product in a direction that more closely aligns with what the marketplace demands. </li>\n</ol>\n",
            " <p>I do this on a regular basis.  A trade show is a good place to gain key business insight, however I want my sales and marketing team focussed on - well selling and marketing.</p>\n\n<p>So - when I usually send technical staff along with key, specific briefs that match with their skills and insight. These might be to review the technology of specific key competitors, or what aligned businesses are doing, or look for things that might be a threat to our business model.    </p>\n\n<p>They might not attend the whole show, just a single day, as this helps to maintain focus.</p>\n\n<p>If you combine this with meeting clients and providing technical support if needed to the selling process, its worth doing.  </p>\n\n<p>It can also help them gain appreciation of what the sales and marketing team actually have to do, which can help to break down internal communication barriers in the company.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong> To fully answer, some of this is funded from my training budget, especially for less senior staff where I need to grow their wider understanding of the industry.  This is usually - but not always - where we have identified a specific career development need.   We also send staff to attend technical conferences on a training budget, and I trust them to report back whether it was high value or not.</p>\n",
            " <p>The obvious value of sending employees to trade shows is extracting them from the dreary sweatshop routine of daily work, &amp; letting them relax a bit at company's expense, see new people, places, get new impressions and ideas. It is a perk that should always be distributed around as fairly as the managers can afford.</p>\n\n<p>(To naysayers: this does help in building morale for the company in general).</p>\n",
            " <p>I've found great value in sending employees whose work with customers is primarily over the phone or via email. Our credit department, in particular, has had great success. Instead of being thought of as a faceless collection agency, our credit reps can show them selves to be problem solvers. </p>\n\n<p>Another benefit is that employees who feel chained to their desks really appreciate the chance to spend a day (on the clock) away from the office doing something new and interacting with customers and coworkers in a different light.</p>\n\n<p>I pick and choose quite carefully. Not every show is appropriate for exrta staff.</p>\n"

She's also frequently volunteering me for tasks, which I find disrespectful, and would never do to her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The solution to this <em>could</em> be simple in theory - make sure you have enough work to fill your plate from other tasks, and then push back when she volunteers you for something:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I'm afraid my schedule is full this week as I'm doing <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>, so I'm going to be unable to take that on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Likewise, you can also push back similarly if she tries to assign you tasks on the basis she didn't get a chance to finish them.</p>\n\n<p>However, this is assuming that your boss understands exactly that things are as you say - that you two are entirely equal, and so she's unable to assign you tasks at her sole discretion. It could well be that your boss agrees with her, feels there's an implied hierarchy in place that he wants to keep, and in that case the only real solution is to request a 1 to 1 with your boss and explain the situation is making you unhappy (though again, avoid pointing fingers at your coworker and stick to the practicalities when explaining what's wrong.)</p>\n\n<p>If neither of the above approaches work then, short of just putting up with it, your only real solution could be to look for employment elsewhere.</p>\n",

            " <p>I am actually working in Japan, and I can tell you that <strong>I am not surprised by their answer.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>It does not tell that it's a bad company, but only a real Japanese company</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>At work (and not only) they are totally inflexible with policies and rules, even if that sounds stupid for you. The good point is that nobody will never address you any reproaches for doing stupid things if the policies or the rules enforced it.\nAnother good point is that if the the rule is smart or/and useful, even people that doesn't understand it will stick to it.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to work with Japanese people or in Japan, you should start changing a bit, and accept that sometimes you'll have to do stupid things because your boss or your client told you so.</p>\n",
            " <p>Consider the company's point of view. What if every job candidate had different preferred software? Now they have to install dozens of different software packages and learn to use them. That would be a giant administrative pain.</p>\n\n<p>And think about what it says about you as a potential employee if you refuse to use the company's preferred software. Suppose you get the job. Are you going to refuse to use the company email system and insist on using your own? Are you going to refuse to write company documents in Word and insist on using Open Office? Are you going to refuse to write your programs in C# and insist on using VB? Are you going to demand that they buy you a special chair and use your preferred brand of coffee maker in the break room? Etc.</p>\n\n<p>There are big advantages to a company if everybody is using the same tools. Sure, there are times when there is good reason to break the pattern and do something different. If a company says \"We always use Microsoft products. You say that in this case where there are overwhelming advantages to using a non-Microsoft project? No, you don't understand, let me explain again. We always use Microsoft products.\", sure, that's foolish and narrow-minded and inflexible. </p>\n\n<p>But it is perfectly reasonable to say, \"We conduct all our tele-meetings with Skype so that our people only need to install one telemeeting product on their computers, and anyone who has that software installed can participate in any meeting. We don't doubt that other products may have advantages, but those advantages are not enough to outweigh the convenience of everyone using the same standard product.\"</p>\n",
            " <p>\"Skype is spyware\": Citation needed.</p>\n\n<p>Fact of the matter is, Skype is simply the most stable videoconferencing product out there.  I once had an interview with a company who asked me to use a lesser-known one (Zoom or something?), and I spent the first 15 minutes trying to set it up after being told that a Linux client existed when it was highly unstable and wouldn't even load on my computer.  Subsequently we tried using Google Hangouts, which connected but the communication was very unstable, so we ended up just using Skype in the end.  I passed the interview anyway, but it would have been much smoother on both sides if we had just used Skype to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>As for why no telephone interview, I'm not exactly sure; what I do know is that many Japanese companies have an obsession with video conferencing.  Perhaps it's because \"we're a tech company we shouldn't use telephones\" or something, I don't know.  But I've never had a phone interview with a Japanese company.  In any case, Skype is much cheaper to use than a long-distance phone call, so that could be a reason too.</p>\n\n<p>Just install Skype and use it.  Uninstall it later if you don't like it, or use a throwaway account, or whatever.</p>\n",
            " <p><strong>TLDR: It's not indicating bad management, but it might mean they are not a good fit for you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It's not a bad company. And Skype is not considered spyware. \nSadly a decent amount of user tracking and convenience over anonymity / user liberty/ security / data protection is the norm these days.</p>\n\n<p>They have their company solution to do interview (and other calls) and they follow that. I'd find it a bit inflexible to not fall back to a normal telephone conversation, but that they are not too keen on installing other software is totally normal. Some companies where individual employees have a lot of individual responsibility and freedom might accept that, but I would not expect that you can dictate to any company how the interview is done.</p>\n\n<p>Now what does it say about the company? It's probably decently large. The larger a company gets the more it tends to follow policies / company wide solutions to standard problems and adhere to them. There are exceptions where individuals / individual departments have large freedoms, but this seems to be a company that has a tight organisation - at least if the HR department is indicative of the rest of the company.</p>\n\n<p>So while it's not ultimately bad, it might just not be an environment where you would want to work. If you prefer flexibility, individual decisions and or a focus on data protection / user empowerment / open source software, then this could indicate that this is not the right company for you. However, sometimes different departments in the same company are run totally different. While the HR department might have strict rules and use mass market software, other departments might be run different. E.g. in many companies the default operating system is Windows (along with central administration), but people in certain departments are allowed to install their own OS on their work machine and manage their machine themselves (but don't get the same support in maintaining it). Whether this is the case, you won't find out if you don't get an interview.</p>\n\n<p>But if you have enough other options, then this can be a quick filter that sorts out companies you likely don't fit with anyway.</p>\n\n<p><em>Options to manage the problem as good as possible</em>: As many companies do use Skype for their remote interview calls, you might want to try and get past that step to see if they are generally a bad fit or whether this is the only thing you don't like while minimising the \"impact\" on you. I'm assuming here that you either don't want to install Skype on your machine, as you consider it spyware, and/or that you don't want to identify yourself towards Microsoft when using Skype. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ask to use normal telephone instead (in this case you tried and did not succeed, but still this, is relatively likely an option,at least compared to suggesting other software based options) </li>\n<li>Use web-skype, that way you avoid an installation of something you consider spyware, you still require an account though</li>\n<li>If you feel really paranoid about it, you might also use a Linux distribution on a USB stick to boot into that instead of your normal OS and either install Skype there or use web skype from that system</li>\n<li>if you want to avoid providing your real phone number when creating a throwaway account, you can try to use an online service that allows you to read sms to mobile numbers provided by them online (google for concrete services); however, those numbers are often black-listed by big companies soon after they go online it seems. So you might have to try a few times till you manage to open an account with one of them. And you run the risk that it is shut-down by Skype should they find out afterwards (no idea what their policy is regarding the usage of such phone numbers). You might want to make sure that is not illegal where you live depending on how harsh your government looks at attempts to stay anonymous.</li>\n<li>buy a cheap/used phone with a prepaid sim card, install Skype there and use it only for your interviews, then get rid of both (or re-install the system on the phone), same option applies to a laptop</li>\n<li>ask in an internet cafe if they can install Skype for you; even if they don't have it on there as a default, they might be fine with installing it. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Personal Opinion</em>: To me it's funny that Skype is now adapted all over the place in corporations when it stopped being the leading solution that works without problems cross-platform quite a while ago.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I've been having horrible luck with job interviews. I have been to many - my resume is great - but just never get the job. </p>\n\n<p>Recently I spoke with a doctor and he put me on the autism spectrum. It's not a big thing, but it involves me having trouble speaking with new people, making eye contact, etc. </p>\n\n<p>I believe the two things may be related. Is this something that I can and should mention during an interview, or does this look bad? (i.e \"You might not get a good first impression, but don't worry!\"). How can I convey this in a professional manner?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>EDIT (since my original answer may already be irrelevant):</p>\n\n<p>Since you seem to be a newcomer to the job market as Anketam correctly guessed. It could just be that you're blowing things out of proportion and psyching yourself out simply because you're not used to rejection.   </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have been to many - my resume is great - but just never get the job.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Job-hunting is a numbers game. That's why it's important to never to use absolute quantifiers like \"never\" or \"always\", and never use vague evasive words like \"many\" when assessing your behavior. </p>\n\n<p>The truth is that you have to treat job-hunting like a real job and that entails using real numbers. Also, it's a fact that rejection doesn't feel good (not just for you, but for everybody), and that our minds are trying to blow that feeling out of proportion so to avoid getting more rejections in the future. </p>\n\n<p>ORIGINAL ANSWER (which may no longer be relevant):</p>\n\n<p>What you're suggesting would go against conventional wisdom, but assuming the job you're looking for is software-related or math-related, and is non-managerial, it may be worth a shot mentioning it. </p>\n\n<p>But I would be very careful with that. Going against conventions is risky. And if you do this, you should try <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\" rel=\"nofollow\">AB testing</a> it. </p>\n\n<p>Just note that in the US, HR departments would try to censor that information out of any resume/cover letter you write, or out of any preliminary interview you take with them, so if you do this, you'll want to mention it to the hiring manager during the job interview, or mention it to them, instead of HR, if you're able to make first contact with them directly.  </p>\n\n<p>On one hand, you don't want to give them a reason to discriminate against you, but on the other hand, they may already be discriminating against you based on your outward behavior during the interview, and putting a label on your behavior could be a good way to bypass that concern. </p>\n\n<p>That being said, the ideal solution would be to focus on your interviewing skills and practice interviewing. After all, even people with autism can improve their verbal and non-verbal demeanor with training. But that is no guarantee either. Perhaps the doctor who diagnosed you could recommend a specialist who could help you with that. </p>\n\n<p>Aside from professional therapy, I'd suggest you take a look at practicing public speaking with <a href=\"http://www.toastmasters.org/Find-a-Club\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toastmasters</a> and practicing technical interviews with <a href=\"https://www.pramp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pramp</a> (assuming you're interviewing for a software developer position). The former is a non-profit public speaking club that has chapters pretty much everywhere. And the latter is a web site where job-hunters take turns interviewing each other over video conferencing and using a technical coding problem that the site gives them. </p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p>First thing first. If you google this question, very likely you would result in bunch of hollow advice like, 'just be yourself, they are also human beings'. Or something like, 'they are more than happy to offer as long as you ask'.</p>\n<p>However, what I observe from reality is that this is totally not true. In reality, even as a capable employee of my boss, my boss would only think about me when he needs me. Other things, he doesn't care at all, and tries to cut every friendly conversation short.</p>\n<p>Soon I grow to realize the seniors just don't bother. I could be wrong, but the impression I got from numerous attempts is like, juniors are just like disposable tools for them to achieve their next great bonus or career aspiration.</p>\n<p>Maybe I'm too pessimistic, but it seems to me to be a problem. Thus, I'm seeking honest answers to how to properly network with seniors within the company (assume a large organization). I want the 0 to 1 process. But things become very difficult, as seniors judge juniors on the ground of 'what can you do for me?'.</p>\n<p>To simplify things and be very honest, the goal of networking would be for career progression. It exists, no matter how you deny it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: some people ask for rigorous definition of juniority. But as the discussion goes, it is never definite. Despite the terms 'junior' and 'senior' are always implicitly consensed, but for the sake of convenience and rigor, a one sentence assumption to facilitate discussion would be: junior is a relative term, relative to N+2 or up. Though junior is more commonly referred to those with &lt;3 years of work experience. But it would be good to see both cases discussed if possible. The focus here is the rank superiority in general.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>Short and simple answer here:</p>\n<p>Try networking at the water-cooler, in breaks or during company events and try to engage in a professional conversation with them (leave politics and similar sensitive and controversial topics out of that, maybe some tech-talk will work depending on the field you are in).</p>\n<p>In case nobody wants to connect with you professionally - you could always sign up for LinkedIn, Xing or the like and start your career-network outside of your current workplace.</p>\n<p>In regards to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot; In reality, even as a capable employee of my boss, my boss would only think about me when he needs me. Other things, he doesn't care at all, and try to cut every friendly conversation short.&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's their choice and quite common - as long as they are friendly you have to accept that. Not everyone wants to engage on a more personal level beyond what's professionally needed - and that's completely within their rights to set that boundary.</p>\n",
            " <p>What I observe in the modern workplace is that most managers do not &quot;network&quot; at all. What time they do not spend working, they spend at home with their family. Fraternizing even with close friends, much less colleagues is minimal. I host very fancy, luxurious parties frequently and have to practically drag people out of their houses to come. Sure, if the person is 25 years old and single they will come. But a 40-year old executive with 3 kids, it is like a 1% chance I can get him to come, unless there is some huge incentive or compulsion. People just aren't interested in socializing anymore. It just gets more and more isolated and insular every year.</p>\n<p>So, the bottom line here is that you are more or less wasting your energy if you want to befriend an older, married executive.</p>\n<p>The only real exception is that when there is some organized activity that the executives make time for, like fishing or hunting or something like that. Planned outings. To the extent that such outings exist, that is what you should concentrate on. You may even be able to nudge people in the company into organizing an outing.</p>\n",
            " <p>Unfortunately, you can't force people to network with you if they're more invested in their own social/professional group.</p>\n<p>There's a couple of tactics you can use to increase your visibility.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Simply be friendly - a friendly smile and a &quot;hello&quot; if you meet managers and a bit of small talk lets them get to know you a little without seeming like you're forcing yourself upon them.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Find out what they enjoy doing and parrot that behaviour.  This behaviour is more common in the USA where if you want to get in with a boss who likes golf (for example), you take up golf.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I generally stay friendly with people and every so often I find myself invited to social events.  It does help that my managers are pretty friendly open people too though.</p>\n",
            " <p>Remember that a senior manager's time is valuable, there are many demands on that time, and that unless you work in a small company, they literally do not have time to spend on just getting to know everyone.</p>\n<p>If you want to get on their radar, you need to do so on merit. Assume they will be annoyed if you waste their time, and don't bother them unless they invite input <em>and</em> you have something that is genuinely worth their time and that they are the most appropriate person to contact for.</p>\n<p>Wait for them to create opportunities -- all-hands meetings where they stay afterwards to take informal questions -- or catch them at social events they sponsor or attend where work isn't the primary focus</p>\n<p>Or, if there is an internal discussion system like Slack which they participate in, you may be able to distinguish yourself by being a valued participant there and you may be noticed. Note that I said &quot;valued&quot;, not just visible.</p>\n<p>Or, network with folks nearer your own level, which is generally much easier <em>and</em> more productive.</p>\n",
            " <p>iLuvLogix has a good answer, but missed an opportunity with their approach.</p>\n<p>If you find a common interest outside of work, you will have a better chance of having a real conversation with whomever you are trying to talk to. Generally, this works best if it's a personal interest of theirs, instead of it being work related, but you can (and probably should) start off the conversation on a work related conversation.</p>\n<p>The trick is to not make it seem like a planned speech or some formal elevator pitch. Keep it conversational and if they aren't interested, try again later. Maybe.</p>\n<p>Don't be pushy, just be friendly. Maybe they just don't have time right that second to talk about it, and maybe they'll come back to <em>you</em> about the topic. And maybe they won't.</p>\n<p>And don't be a pest. Talk to them when it seems natural to do so, rather than chasing them down at every opportunity.</p>\n<p>People have a wide variety of responses to social interaction and not all of them are great. If you've seen the original GhostBusters movie, you might remember that Janine tries to spark up a conversation with Egon soon after was she hired, but fails miserably because he doesn't really know how to respond appropriately. There may simply not be a good way to interact with some people without a significant amount of effort, and some of that effort may not be welcome, so definitely pick and choose the appropriate people to try to talk to. This feeds into the last paragraph of iLuvLogix 's answer, which I totally agree with.</p>\n",
            " <p>If you want to socialize, then find social events at work to attend. Does your company have</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Employee events? Things like summer picnic, Christmas party.</li>\n<li>Charity work. There might be a fund raising for a &quot;5k walk for ____&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These kinds of events don't run themselves, and volunteering is a good way to interact with people.</p>\n<p>If you work for a souless kind of corporation, maybe you can lead some small events. A potluck lunch. A fantasy sports league (months worth of small talk right here). A halloween office decoration contest.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>If you want to network, I would search for &quot;problems&quot; to work on(*). This depends on your skillset, and the industry you work in.</p>\n<p>Do you interface with other departments? Are you aware of any direct &quot;friction&quot; that causes inefficency? Perhaps your supervisor isn't so keen on small talk, but maybe topics of a more &quot;corporate&quot; interest are easier to converse on. Ideally, this is more productive than just complaining about something.</p>\n<p>Some companies have small amounts of funds allocated to &quot;business development&quot; or small R&amp;D type projects. Such projects often would benefit from additional help. This is a good way to meet peers with unrelated skills, but also networking with superiors.</p>\n<p>Do you have relevant skills that your peers do not, or more experience in some area? Leading a &quot;lunch and learn&quot; event could be beneficial where you talk about a specific technology.</p>\n<p>Do you have IT/programming skills? I guarantee there are higherups that spend too much time on a simple task that coule be automated by a simple script (beware (*)). Something that helped my current career was working on a problem several senior managers were dealing with.</p>\n<p>Do you have annual performance reviews? Maybe you and your supervisor can define a small (*) extra goal that touches on the above concepts. This also provides justification for further discussion (status repotrs, clarification on goals/requirements, etc).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(*) Budget your time accordingly, probably outside of your normal working hours. Some of these tasks you will be compensated for, some you will not. This may or may not ever pay off. In your situation, perhaps corporate recognition has intrinsic value. Set a personal limit on your &quot;risk tolerance&quot; and how long you are willing to wait for any payoff.</p>\n",
            " <p>The same way you make conversation with anyone else: you find out what their hobbies and interests are and look for overlap with your own. I ran into a senior manager for my company at the airport gate when we were both flying home after a company event. Didn't even <em>know</em> he was a senior manager at my company, but noticed that he had some boat-related paraphernalia, and I like sailing, so I struck up a conversation. Of course during the course of the conversation realized who he was, we talked shop a bit.</p>\n<p>Did I get any tangible benefit? Not immediately. But that wasn't the goal: I was just making the best of the situation I found myself in. Now, at least to that particular individual, my face is not a blank one in a mass of peons, but instead &quot;that guy I met at the airport and talked about sailing and yachts with&quot;. You are almost certainly <strong>not</strong> going to have some &quot;big break&quot; moment where a senior manager &quot;discovers&quot; you and you finally get all the recognition you crave and you feel your talent deserves. You get there by being a competent affable self-promoter who gets **** done and doesn't let anyone forget it.</p>\n<p>It helps to genuinely like people. Or to be a scheming Machiavellian sociopath. The first one is easier for me, YMMV.</p>\n",
            " <p>Personally, I feel like 'networking' as a career move should be retired.</p>\n<p>Unless you're in sales and relationships are your business, networking can be overrated.</p>\n<p>As more companies focus on technology and automation, TedTalk style presentations seem to garner more internal respect than generic water cooler conversations. Leaders and managers have to be webinar mastercrafters.</p>\n<p>If your company does regular meetings with employee-led agendas, consider proposing a talk on a new technology or process that you or your team have found successful. Or if you're more on the business side of things, create a case-study on one of your clients.</p>\n<p>Managers love this kind of stuff and will gladly work with employees to demonstrate team wins.</p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> <em>My business partner has blocked me from contacting him personally and no longer contributes to our business. Is it necessary to inform him that I no longer will be performing my responsibilities as outlined in our agreement?</em></p>\n\n<p>My co-founder 'Bob' and I have a Partnership Agreement to run a small online business - a Youtube channel along with a few social media accounts. His responsibilities were research and recording audio; mine were research, video production, and running the social media accounts. Our venture has not earned any money. Bob also was my long distance relationship boyfriend.</p>\n\n<p>Bob's contribution since the beginning of the venture has been up-and-down. There were a few weeks in which he would record as per the schedule we agreed upon, and then stop after a minor setback (ie. our videos did not receive views/comments). I would ask him from time to time to return to schedule, but he asked me to stop doing so. He did, however, buy a ~$30 microphone to record, of his own volition. He never stated that he no longer wanted to be business partners. I take responsibility for being too lax in negotiating.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I kept to the video production schedule, and I have updated (and continue to update) the social media accounts everyday.</p>\n\n<p>A few months ago Bob and I broke up amicably, but did not discuss what to do with the business. I continued updating the social media accounts during that time. After about a month or so to let the steam cool, I called Bob up to say that I was still interested in running the business and if he was interested in continuing our SOLELY business partnership. He indicated that he was interested in recording again.</p>\n\n<p>The next day I found out that Bob had blocked my personal lines of contact to him.</p>\n\n<p>I have not tried contacting him since then, but I have continued to update the social media accounts. I am no longer interested in doing so, and would like to know if it would be necessary to inform Bob, who is still in a Partnership Agreement with me, that I will no longer be performing my responsibilities as outlined in the agreement. He has not blocked the business's e-mail or social media accounts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> OP here. To clarify further, as this looks to be a point of confusion, Bob has not performed his responsibilities to the business since several weeks before we broke up. All in all, thank you everyone for your responses and advice.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

What other factors might you need to consider?</p>\n<p>In particular I am wondering about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how it might affect how you are viewed by potential employers if non-professional SEs are linked to your Careers 2.0 profile</li>\n<li>similarly, how it might affect how you are viewed by current employers</li>\n<li>what other disadvantages there might be to having all questions on the same account that I haven't considered, why they are a disadvantage and how they could be mitigated <em>other</em> than by using two accounts</li>\n<li>if there are any advantages (besides convenience) of having everything on the same account - in particular regarding (though not limited to) professionalism and the workplace</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Thanks everybody who has contributed so far.

            " <p>I think they chose wisely when they decided to call the points tallied in the StackExchange system \"reputation\". Anything you connect with your name will affect your actual reputation. Employers are unlikely to care about the numeric connection, but if/when they read your responses, those responses are going to reflect back on you. Even if you maintain separate accounts, ultimately there is a good chance to slip up and accidentally link them somewhere. Possibly an email address, a cross post, an accidental post, etc. Once they become linked by any of the search engines the exercise of separating the accounts will have proved pointless.</p>\n\n<p>My advice, as someone who interviews software engineers (and I do check them out online), is to remain entirely anonymous for any activity that you don't want publicly associated with your name. However, from the same standpoint, I typically disregard 90% of what I see online regarding a candidate that does not specifically impact their work habits and behaviors. I can understand the desire to keep some things from being related to you in this respect, but I don't think multiple accounts will do you any favors in the long run. </p>\n",

I would be more inclined to only link to professional contacts on LinkedIn and personal contacts on Facebook. Neither of these are going on my resume.

There are always tasks available.  There are several issue tracking/ticketing systems available on the market (many free) which can be filled with tasks and prioritised, allowing people to simply take the next task off the queue.  If the queue is empty, we expect people to talk to their supervisors for new work.</p>\n\n<p>If you have no software and can't obtain tasking except at the start of the day, keep a notebook of tasks that will help your company advance.

To start with you can make sure that your manager keeps your to-do list sufficiently long that you never run out, but eventually you might want to influence the working procedures of your workplace towards a more agile approach (where your <em>team</em> has a to-do list, and you grab the item at the top when you're free).</p>\n\n<h2>Find ways to generate value yourself</h2>\n\n<p>If you think your manager will just give you make-work to get you out of their hair, or if you don't like the sound of asking for more, then why don't you look for some ways you can generate value for the company yourself? See if you can automate a build or a deployment. Introduce a tool to automatically enforce a policy usually checked by hand. There are usually thousands of things that could get done that we never get around to.</p>\n\n<p>Use your judgement, though. You're likely to want to clear this kind of thing with your manager anyway.</p>\n\n<h2>Improve your skills</h2>\n\n<p>Read a book, explore an API, dig into the source control logs of an open-source component your project uses.</p>\n\n<p>Learn about the domain you're working in. Are there any useful documents on your intranet? Regulations that it would be useful for you to understand?</p>\n\n<p>Good employers will appreciate your initiative, though you may wish to exercise caution before indulging yourself excessively.</p>\n",

            " <p>This is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_continuity_planning#Business_continuity\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>business continuity</em></a> issue. Some of the other answers are focusing on how to approach the idea of working from home for yourself, but that isn't the real problem here.</p>\n\n<p>You say your company is a relatively large organisation, and it has in-house IT (you, and your department). Therefore it will have someone in charge of disaster recovery and business continuity already working on this. They have probably done or are currently doing a risk assessment. So far they haven't determined the risk to the business very high, but that might change.</p>\n\n<p>The overall risk is not only to you, or your coworkers, but to the business (and in the wider sense the overall economy). Let's play this through, from the view of the company.</p>\n\n<p>Assume half the staff gets ill. They don't have to be seriously ill, just unable to work. If 250 of 500 people can't go to work, chances are the company will not produce any products or services in that time. SLAs with customers will not be fulfilled, leading to penalty payments. Customers will leave. If there is production, machines need to be stopped, which is costly (think car factory). All the running costs, in particular salaries and buildings and things like this will still have to be paid, but there is no revenue. That means the company will lose money fast. And with its liquidity it will lose the ability to pay your salary. You will lose your job, and the company will fold. </p>\n\n<p>A recent example <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/05/flybe-collapses-as-covid-19-triggers-fall-in-airline-bookings\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">of this already happening is Flybe</a>, where CoVID-19 has been named as something like the last drop (credibility of this source unclear). </p>\n\n<p>Now what does that mean for you? It's hard to say. The risk assessment isn't your job, but you can take precautions.</p>\n\n<p>No-one will blame you for voicing your concerns in this situation, even if that is not part of your job. If you have already got infrastructure in place to work from home, use it. They are likely not going to question you. In particular if your commute involves busy public transport, there are lots of good arguments to not go to work. The main argumentation is not to keep yourself from getting sick, but from spreading the virus (or other illnesses that someone else might contract in addition to the virus because their immune system is weakened) into the office.</p>\n\n<p>My suggestion is to ask your manager about business continuity plans. Looks at what companies around you are doing. If you have a spouse you live with, has their company sent everyone home? These are good arguments to give them.</p>\n\n<p>Your company's business continuity team might be well prepared and currently executing risk mitigation, or it might not. In either case, they will appreciate that some people are aware and conscious of the situation.</p>\n"

I don't like doing this but right now money is important for me as I'm trying to pay off student loans.</p>\n\n<p>How do I best phrase this in an email?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hi,</p>\n  \n  <p>Regarding job x at location y on date z, I'm very sorry but I've\n  become double booked and will no longer be able to attend. If at all\n  helpful, I have contacts that can cover my shift.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A large part of which one's I decided to keep and which one's I cancel on, is based on pay. Should I mention this or not (some did pay bellow standard)?</p>\n\n<p>I would like to keep on good terms with the agencies as possible as I would like to find work with them in the future.</p>\n\n<p>I got two longer term offers from 2 different agencies. Coincidentally the second starts on the same week as the first one ends. So I have to miss a couple shifts if I were to do both. How can I phrase this email asking if this is possible or if they need someone who can do 100% of the shifts?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hi,</p>\n  \n  <p>Due to a resent change in my schedule, I was wondering if it's\n  possible someone else can do the shifts for event x on day y and z?\n  Unfortunately I've become double booked. Please let me know before changing > anything and I'll reply back.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Last sentence is important as some of these agencies are quick to jump the gun and I don't want both of them to cancel shifts and be left without any work on these days. Does this email convey the point correctly?</p>\n\n<p>I don't want to say this is contract work as I never signed a contract. As such, it is legal what I'm doing, but again I do feel bad about cancelling on them. </p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: <h2>First, a little bit of background:</h2>\n\n<p>I've been in this company for a little over 2 years. We were a small team of 3 people managing and developing the tools for our companies (we are the HQ). Almost 5 months ago, one of our colleagues left and since then I am having an increased number of tasks. Over these 2 years I have learned a lot and now I'm faster and more efficient at completing tasks and am able to tackle more complex matters too.</p>\n\n<h2>Salary history</h2>\n\n<p>This job was advertised as \"the minimum salary for this job is xx$\". And since before this job I've done a one year internship and it was the first \"real\" job plus the fact that it was matching perfectly with what I've done for one year and it also was what I wanted to continue with, I didn't try to negotiate this minimum offered salary out of fear of not getting the job. Fast forward 1 year later, I was waiting for the first employee appraisal in the hopes that I will be able to get a salary increase. Unfortunately, the management decided they want to change the direction in which the company is going and my boss was let go. Shortly after, we got a new boss and nobody had his appraisal that year from the department. Waited almost another year for the next appraisal, for which I have asked multiple times, over a time span of 2 months, and finally had the meeting and at the end of the meeting finally asked for a raise.</p>\n\n<p>Off-topic: The raise mentioned above is quite big in %, almost 30% but considering that even with that raise for my current experience I will be on par with the job market or even lower. I am not justifying my asked increase based on the fact that I've been doing this for over 2 years, but based on the market and what they would need to spend to replace me. I'd like to point out that I received a positive feedback in the appraisal and was told to keep up the good work.</p>\n\n<h2>Back to the salary negotiation</h2>\n\n<p>I didn't get a no from my boss for my asked raise, just that he needs to talk to HR. I was pretty happy back then because I thought that even if in the event in which I wasn't to going to get exactly what I asked for, I would be happy with even a slightly lower increase (20-25%). Now 3 months and a half passed and I have asked 4 times about the status of my request and stating that this is important to me not only due to the financial part but this would reflect how the company values me. Every time, I get more or less the same answer: still waiting for an answer from HR (my boss has a very important position in the company and probably he is not being honest as this salary increase should be very well in his power).</p>\n\n<h2>Notes:</h2>\n\n<p>This question is not about the %. As mentioned before, I didn't get a \"no\" for one second or a remark that it's too much.</p>\n\n<p>I love working here and I have spend a lot of time to learn the specifics of this company, I would like to do everything in my power to avoid leaving.</p>\n\n<p>The company is looking for months for someone to replace the colleague who left and they haven't been able to do it so far (mostly because with the set of skills asked, those people are already working as consultants and earning more). Note: the colleague which left the company, left for the same reason: asked for a raise and he got a \"no\". But at least he got an answer pretty fast...</p>\n\n<h2>Question</h2>\n\n<p>How should I continue from here? Should I try to be more pushy and ask again if he's (boss) happy with my performance and if the answer is \"yes\" then go ahead and ask firmly to have my situation finalized. Is it normal that it takes this long for an answer, or this would show a complete lack of interest for the employee? My goal is to at least get a \"no\" or a \"yes\", tired of waiting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Probably not a duplicate of \"How to approach my boss if I'm feeling underpaid\". I have already read that even before I had my first negotiation and followed the advices there to discus about my achievements and why I should I be getting a raise. Now it's a matter of done that and <strong>now what</strong>?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit nr. 2</strong>: Since I can't add a comment to Joe's answer due to the low reputation, I'll type additional info here. First of all, thank you Joe, long time reader of your answers here. My boss talked to HR for sure at least once, because there was also the discussion if they should change my contract type to have more hours included, to that HR sent back quite fast a \"no\" because I am not above a certain trigger that they are having. I know that they can't afford losing another team member because due to the specifics of the job, it takes 6 months to 1 year to get familiarized with all the custom tools and how they are built (can be faster for a fast learner). Now, I don't know why would HR drag this, the only reason I could think of, is they are first looking for a replacement for my colleague and once they have that they will say \"no\" to me.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Several times in my career, I've encountered situations where the business has a technical problem, and I have the previous experience and skills necessary to resolve the issue.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of being trusted to solve the issue, these companies have typically hired (expensive) external consultants to come in and \"save us\". Their theory being \"they're paid to work in that area, so they must be experts\"...</p>\n\n<p>In each case, I've already presented my understanding of the problem and my proposed solution. Each and every time, the consultants produce a report that supports my conclusions (but often goes into less detail - as I've had the advantage of examining the original issue over more time).</p>\n\n<p>Then, what usually happens is that I've gained some \"business credibility\" in subject \"A\", but if a problem ever occurs with topic \"B\" it'll be the same uphill battle all over again.</p>\n\n<p>I've also seen attitudes resembling:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"We don't know, so you can't know.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If they've had an issue for months or years, then you join and suggest something they haven't tried, there's almost a willful refusal to consider the possibility.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The consultants are employed by the vendor/OEM, so they must know.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even when it's a relatively trivial issue, they'll assume they need an oracle on the subject (thinking along the lines of \"we have a Java issue, James Gosling must be the only person able to help us\").</p>\n\n<p>Now, I'd hope that I have a reasonably realistic assessment of my own abilities (or lack thereof), so when there's a problem outside of my \"domain\" I'll just do everything possible to stay out of the way and absorb the knowledge demonstrated by whoever gets tasked with resolving it (basically, I don't pretend to know what I don't know about). </p>\n\n<p><strong>How can I convince my employer that I have the level of competence they require when it's in an area where they lack the expertise to assess competence?</strong> </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>A few people commenting and answering have missed a nuance to my question. The people I'm working with are not incompetent in general (quite the opposite in fact), they simply lack competence <strong>for a given skill</strong> - usually on a rare topic.</p>\n\n<p>This means I do not patronize, talk down to them or speak to them with any disdain or disrespect (as some answerers have assumed). In fact, when the topic is in an area they have a degree of familiarity with, I find it very easy to get \"buy-in\" and support for my ideas. The only time I encounter any issues is when they lack the tools to assess my competence in a skill they lack themselves.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>The best way to prevent the race for a consultant is present a convincing business case that doesn't include a consultant.  From the business cases I've developed the main points are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Thoroughly define the problem being solved - Do not include your solution within the problem definition.  Concisely state the problem in business terms rather than technical terms.  For example \"Based on submitted bug reports customers find feature X confusing.  This confusion leads to frustration and reduces engagement in the overall product.\" is much better than \"The UI of feature X is flawed in these ways...\" because it states the problem in terms of business value.  In terms of solution ownership this shows that you understand the issue from a business perspective which is key since this is the same perspective that the decision makers will be looking from.  This will get everyone on the same page as to what the problem is from a high level.</li>\n<li>State your solution along with several other possible plans of\naction including the null case of doing nothing and state the\ncosts/benefits for each. For the above example I would go through\ndoing nothing, scrapping feature X, improving user training/help\ndocuments, reworking the UI on feature X.  This shows that you have\nlooked at the issue from several sides rather than immediately\nhopping onto your pet solution to the exclusion of all others.</li>\n<li>Show how you can effectively test if your solution eliminates the\nproblem.  This is huge in selling non-technical people on technical\nsolutions.  They want assurance that their investment is working so\nif you can give them concrete parameters and a way to measure\nsuccess.  If the definition of success is murky it is\npsychologically much harder to buy in to an idea.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My best real world example regarding going to a consultant is imagine you go to a mechanic for routine inspection.  If you hear \"Your garbles are cracked.  It's $800 to change them out.  Should I go ahead with that?\"  you are not going to be very confident in your ability to know if your money is being well spent and you may get a second opinion.  If you hear \"Your garbles are slightly cracked which could lead to your steering failing if you hit a pothole.  We could wait and see but that's risky.  I could weld across the crack for $500 but I wouldn't trust it long run.  It would be $800 to swap them out.  Swapping them out is the only way we can be sure they will hold.  What do you want me to do?\" you are going to feel more empowered to make a good decision even if the ultimate decision is the same.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note in a lot of places you are going to be fighting the culture to make headway on this.  Don't take it personally if the default answer is consultancy, just continue to work on your sales skills for selling your ideas to management.  When a decision goes against you on this remember that you may be missing pieces of the bigger picture (ie cost of failure may be higher than it generally appears due to interdependencies) or the opportunity cost for you doing this project rather than something else might be too high.</p>\n",
            " <p>I've seen the same type of issue in my own past.  As noted by Myles part of the issue might be a communication problem. Often, people will not necessarily understand a technical person's description of a problem or the appropriate solution. Graphs, pictures and external supporting references sometimes confer some comfort to the reader.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of your communication skills I suggest there is a very difficult to overcome reason for such behavior as a company grows. Higher level people who are making decisions often abhor making a decision that they can be held directly accountable for. If they take a risk on a solution you propose and it doesn't work out they either stumble themselves or a strong internal resource stumbles.</p>\n\n<p>Neither is acceptable to some people.</p>\n\n<p>When a brand name consultant comes along, which of course appears to represent expertise, which at times is simply not any more advanced than internal resources, there is a nice convenient place to put the blame. I went with what the consultants proposed and so did the rest of the stakeholders involved. It came in a flashy document with loads of details which must mean it was correct.</p>\n\n<p>So, yes, if there's a problem we fire the consultant. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not a fan of this but I have seen the reins handed over to bumbling consulting and development groups too many times to discount this effect. Now, there are other good reasons, such as not having the time and resources to tackle the issue internally -- or quite simply not having a large enough team with solid skills in the area being considered even though one or two folks may.</p>\n\n<p>My viewpoint may be peppered with a touch of jaded... ;)</p>\n",
            " <p>I wonder why you oppose bringing in consultants if the end results is that something gets implemented that is just what you would have suggested, especially when afterwards everyone agrees that you totally did know what the right course of action was. Is it that you would have liked to get recognition in advance that your idea was right? Is it that you think the company is wasting money paying consultants for advice they could have had for free?</p>\n\n<p>Those external consultants (and yes, quite often I am one of them) bring a lot more into the group than the idea of what to do to get your problem solved. They bring external authority and expertise, which often sways other participants into changing their ways, far more so than a logical explanation of why a particular course of action is right. They bring a convenient scapegoat also - if someone changes how they do things because a colleague or peer said to, and it goes bad, the blame will be on the changer, but if someone changes how they do things because a highly paid external consultant said to, and it goes bad, the blame will be on the consultant. They also demonstrate, by the sheer money that is being spent on them, that management is truly committed to making this change.</p>\n\n<p>I can't tell you how many times someone has told me \"that recommendation you made today, that they've all agreed to and are starting to do? I argued for that a month ago and nobody would listen.\" I reassure them that this is a widespread phenomenon that <strong>does not</strong> (and here's where I start to actually answer your question) <strong>reflect management's actual opinion of their skill level.</strong> Let me say that again. The reason people don't take your advice, and then later take that very same advice from a paid external consultant, is <strong>not</strong> because they think you are less skilled than you are or your advice is less valuable than it is. </p>\n\n<p>Go ahead and put a little effort into showing you can solve it yourself. If they don't listen (and they probably won't) make sure you get a chance to work closely with the consultants. You can tell them what you know, which will improve the quality of the solution, you may (or may not) learn from them, and when the project succeeds you will be associated with the success. Don't get worked up about the possibility that silly old management is incapable of understanding how good you are or how simple their technical problems are. You may be right, but often there is more to a technical problem than a technical solution.</p>\n",
            " <p>My problem with the question is that it assumes the person who made the choice to hire a consultant is incompetent.  I do not think the Dunning-Kruger failure effect is the real or only reason why you are not successful in your attempts to convince people not to use consultants when you have the available skills. And really what do you gain by assuming that other people are falling into the Dunning-Kruger effect? Does this help you be effective at work in any way?  Why are you even thinking about it? It actually prevents you from seeing what you can do to improve the situation if you are stuck on the idea that other people are incompetent.</p>\n\n<p>First, if your attitude is that they just don't get me and recognize how wonderful I am, then people will pick up that you resent them and be less likely to consult you. So stop even thinking about Dunning-Kruger because it is irrelevant to getting the job done. Your post came across as pretty negative about your managers' incompetence. If I thought that, then there is a good chance that they do too. </p>\n\n<p>Next, there are so many reasons to hire consultants over your own employees to solve problems that have nothing to do with what they think of you. </p>\n\n<p>First you may be highly thought of and they don't think they can spare the time from your regular duties for you to do this.</p>\n\n<p>Second, you may not be presenting your ideas in a way that they understand. Technical people tend to focus on the technical, managers tend to focus on the business need. You have to be talking their language.</p>\n\n<p>Third they may have money in the budget they need to spend or they won't get it next year.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, they may agree with your solution but know it is an easier sell to senior management if it comes from an outside source. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to contribute to change at your organization, you need to first start helping the consultants. It will be noticed that you have contributed if you do this.  Pay attention to how they present the results versus how you did it. Learn how to present ideas like a successful consultant.  </p>\n\n<p>Next don't assume that the people making the decisions are even aware of your skills. Likely anyone beyond your immediate boss doesn't know you already have the skills they are looking for. I've even had bosses who did not know my background if they were not the person who originally hired me and the task was outside the normal duties I did for them. (But if I wanted them to use those skills, I made sure to make sure they knew.) You need to become visible to the higher levels of the organization, see this question for more on this subject:\n<a href=\"https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/11816/why-is-it-important-to-gain-visibility-in-the-workplace\">Why is it important to gain &quot;visibility&quot; in the workplace?</a> </p>\n\n<p>You should welcome the consultants because every time they make the same recommendation you did, then your credibility is increased.</p>\n",
            " <p>Serious problems rarely have one solution nor are they always solved to a specific degree. There is some gray area. Like all engineers, you want to solve problems (which is good), but managers also have to factor in risk.</p>\n\n<p>Consultants can mitigate risk:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>They were highly recommended (i.e. it's not my fault if they screw up)</li>\n<li>They can be contractually held to providing solutions or payment can be withheld where as employees just get fired.</li>\n<li>Consultants can have access to other types of expertise if something unexpected comes up.</li>\n<li>Current Staff may have expertise, but not the time to implement a solution.</li>\n<li>Some managers have previous experience with a particular consultant, so they feel more comfortable with that person. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(Per update to the question) It is safe to assume that people who lack knowledge in an area struggle to identify those who can. It seems like you're able to put together a detailed proposal, but management may be more comfortable if you just get to the point.</p>\n",
            " <p>The empirical evidence says that when you know a good solution you are unable to build group consensus that it is the best way forward. Unless you consistently work for, and with, incompetent people, then the balance of probabilities is that the problem is in your soft skills, specifically with consensus building. This may be a case of Dunning-Kruger but where you are over-estimating your skills in the area of teamwork, consensus building, and stakeholder management. </p>\n\n<p>You state that \"instead of being trusted to solve the issue\" they hire in a consultant. No-one is infallible so taking something on trust is taking a risk. If there is significant potential downside it would be irrational not to minimise risk. It is trivial to eliminate the risk of taking what you say on trust; get a consultant in for a second opinion. A lack of \"soft skills\" and an over focus on the technical aspects of problem solving may be driving them into hiring consultants. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=EQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">high EQ</a> approach is:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Don't bring <em>your</em> solution to the group; bring the group to <em>their</em> solution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Parachuting a solution into a group of stakeholders always risks rejection. People will not have thought through all the avenues you have thought through. They cannot feel comfortable that all the possible alternatives are inferior. The high EQ approach is to talk the solution space over with some key stakeholders one-to-one in advance of any group meetings. This refines your argument and builds support for your recommendations. Go over some possible approaches you have rejected asking whether your rejection reasoning is sound. Then present your favoured solution asking if you have missed any angles, risks or issues. Finally ask them if they can think of any good alternative approaches. Repeat this with a few stakeholders one-to-one until you are sure you have all the angles covered and have perfected your pitch. </p>\n\n<p>Only then hold a group meeting with all stakeholders and take the same approach; go through the alternatives which have been rejected and why. Then pitch your favoured solution and perhaps an alternative someone else has come up with to show you are being open minded and balanced. </p>\n\n<p>Taking such a consensus building approach works for many reasons: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>People feel you have listened and have a fully rounded perspective on all risk and issues.  </li>\n<li>People understand the alternative ideas you have considered and why\nthey are rejected.</li>\n<li>You learn new things about risks and issues of alternative solutions.</li>\n<li>You learn which risks and issues stakeholders are more or less concerned about.   </li>\n<li>Some people you have consulted feel vested in your preferred solution because you have taken time to go over it with them.  </li>\n<li>Some people get more time to consider your solution on two encounters; once when you go over it with them directly and a second time when you bring it to the wider group. If your solution is superior to the alternatives they are likely to be convinced that it is the best way forward. </li>\n<li>You can present the solution as being a group solution by saying things like \"Mary pointed out that X could go wrong which we can cover by doing Y\". </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=EQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Googling \"EQ\"</a> brings up: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For most people, emotional intelligence (EQ) is more important than\n  one's intelligence (IQ) in attaining success in their lives and\n  careers. As individuals our success and the success of the profession\n  today depend on our ability to read other people's signals and react\n  appropriately to them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You should read that people are not persuaded by your approach and are unwilling to simply trust you. The appropriate reaction is to engage with people, learn their concerns, help them to refine the solution, and pitch the solution as owned by the team, not by you. </p>\n",
            " <p>I think you might be missing another aspect of the cost-benefit equation here.</p>\n\n<p>There are quite a few reasons to hire consultants, and one of those is to simply allow for the internal staff to be able to focus on the day to day running of the environment.<br>\nI've come into quite a few shops where the staff knew what the problem was, and had a pretty good idea of the cause or even a solution already planned.</p>\n\n<p>Going into these environments, my main impression is usually that I'm being asked for a plan not because they don't have one, but because <em>they want to compare it with the plan already provided by their internal staff to gauge my competence</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The internal staff is usually required for day to day workings, and are the first stop whenever a problem occurs. While the issue I'm brought in to fix is something that, while often time consuming, is not a recurring action. And as such can easily be handled by an external asset who can be safely let go once the job is done.</p>\n\n<p>Have you actually asked your boss(es) why they prefer hiring consultants for these issues in stead of going with your recommendations?<br>\nIf they are competent managers, the answer might surprise you, and have less to do with their perceived competence of your skills than you think.</p>\n",
            " <p>Catalogue all the times this has happened, get estimates for how much was spent on consultants to come up with solutions (as opposed to implementing them), then go as high as you can in the organisation and ask for a pay raise.</p>\n\n<p>The obvious rule of thumb being used here is \"more expense = more excellence\".

        "sft_target": " <p>The best way to prevent the race for a consultant is present a convincing business case that doesn't include a consultant.  From the business cases I've developed the main points are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Thoroughly define the problem being solved - Do not include your solution within the problem definition.  Concisely state the problem in business terms rather than technical terms.  For example \"Based on submitted bug reports customers find feature X confusing.  This confusion leads to frustration and reduces engagement in the overall product.\" is much better than \"The UI of feature X is flawed in these ways...\" because it states the problem in terms of business value.  In terms of solution ownership this shows that you understand the issue from a business perspective which is key since this is the same perspective that the decision makers will be looking from.  This will get everyone on the same page as to what the problem is from a high level.</li>\n<li>State your solution along with several other possible plans of\naction including the null case of doing nothing and state the\ncosts/benefits for each. For the above example I would go through\ndoing nothing, scrapping feature X, improving user training/help\ndocuments, reworking the UI on feature X.  This shows that you have\nlooked at the issue from several sides rather than immediately\nhopping onto your pet solution to the exclusion of all others.</li>\n<li>Show how you can effectively test if your solution eliminates the\nproblem.  This is huge in selling non-technical people on technical\nsolutions.  They want assurance that their investment is working so\nif you can give them concrete parameters and a way to measure\nsuccess.  If the definition of success is murky it is\npsychologically much harder to buy in to an idea.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My best real world example regarding going to a consultant is imagine you go to a mechanic for routine inspection.  If you hear \"Your garbles are cracked.  It's $800 to change them out.  Should I go ahead with that?\"  you are not going to be very confident in your ability to know if your money is being well spent and you may get a second opinion.  If you hear \"Your garbles are slightly cracked which could lead to your steering failing if you hit a pothole.  We could wait and see but that's risky.  I could weld across the crack for $500 but I wouldn't trust it long run.  It would be $800 to swap them out.  Swapping them out is the only way we can be sure they will hold.  What do you want me to do?\" you are going to feel more empowered to make a good decision even if the ultimate decision is the same.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note in a lot of places you are going to be fighting the culture to make headway on this.  Don't take it personally if the default answer is consultancy, just continue to work on your sales skills for selling your ideas to management.  When a decision goes against you on this remember that you may be missing pieces of the bigger picture (ie cost of failure may be higher than it generally appears due to interdependencies) or the opportunity cost for you doing this project rather than something else might be too high.</p>\n",
        "rejected_target": " <p>I've seen the same type of issue in my own past.  As noted by Myles part of the issue might be a communication problem. Often, people will not necessarily understand a technical person's description of a problem or the appropriate solution. Graphs, pictures and external supporting references sometimes confer some comfort to the reader.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of your communication skills I suggest there is a very difficult to overcome reason for such behavior as a company grows. Higher level people who are making decisions often abhor making a decision that they can be held directly accountable for. If they take a risk on a solution you propose and it doesn't work out they either stumble themselves or a strong internal resource stumbles.</p>\n\n<p>Neither is acceptable to some people.</p>\n\n<p>When a brand name consultant comes along, which of course appears to represent expertise, which at times is simply not any more advanced than internal resources, there is a nice convenient place to put the blame. I went with what the consultants proposed and so did the rest of the stakeholders involved. It came in a flashy document with loads of details which must mean it was correct.</p>\n\n<p>So, yes, if there's a problem we fire the consultant. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not a fan of this but I have seen the reins handed over to bumbling consulting and development groups too many times to discount this effect. Now, there are other good reasons, such as not having the time and resources to tackle the issue internally -- or quite simply not having a large enough team with solid skills in the area being considered even though one or two folks may.</p>\n\n<p>My viewpoint may be peppered with a touch of jaded... ;)</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I have a personal project (web app) which is going well and I think there's a realistic chance of it growing into a startup, at which point I would have to hire people.</p>\n\n<p>This would be the first time I've done anything like this. I've been daydreaming about what the hiring process might be like, when there's only me in the beginning. Technology interviews are notorious for testing people on things which don't necessarily predict the quality of the hire.</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking of doing something like this.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Candidate sends their CV, gets a phone call, and an interview on the order of, say one hour. So far so normal.</p></li>\n<li><p>If the interview goes well, the candidate is hired for up to one day (perhaps the same day), and paid by the hour for however many hours it ends up being. On this day they'd be given access to source code and development systems as if they were an employee and asked to do a few challenging and time-limited tasks which are actually relevant to the project.</p></li>\n<li><p>If the first day goes well, the candidate is hired for up to one week, paid per day for however many days it ends up being. Again they're asked to do actually relevant work, but this time they're not being time pressured and the tasks would be larger in scope. Here they'd be demonstrating their self-management skills as much as anything else.</p></li>\n<li><p>If the first week goes well they're given a normal contract, probationary for the first few months, and treated as a full employee.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The upsides to this process as I see it are that the candidate is being more thoroughly tested in the real work environment, and paying the candidate to do anything beyond a couple of hours' interview seems reasonable.</p>\n\n<p>I can anticipate the potential downsides of legal and managerial overhead, this looks like it will involve a significant upfront investment of effort to organise. Also for the first week the candidate could be fired at any moment, this might create a threatening atmosphere. For a one-man team which is just starting to expand, maybe this sets the wrong tone.</p>\n\n<p>Instinctively, this feels like a good idea, but I haven't heard of anyone hiring this way.</p>\n\n<p>Is it a good idea? Do you have experience seeing anything like this go well or badly?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>I don't think a 'one day contract' is a good idea.  I think that good candidates would not agree to do that for a startup.  They might for Google or Amazon, but not for [unnamed startup with zero employees].  </p>\n\n<p>It's also unlikely that you would get very much out of someone in just one day; unless you're doing something uninteresting that is more a commodity operation (i.e., setting up websites for people), it usually takes <em>some</em> time to get up to speed on the project in a useful fashion. Startups are quicker than most in this regard, but one day seems like a stretch. Employment paperwork takes time, after all, if nothing else.</p>\n\n<p>However, what you're describing is not all <em>that</em> unusual for companies with a somewhat longer probationary period.  You could possibly hire someone on a short contract, say one to three months, if they seem like good candidates. This is called \"Contract to Hire\" and means that after the contract term, you consider their performance and offer them a full time position if they meet your standards.  </p>\n\n<p>You still need to make some effort on the interview side, though; I personally think interviews are mostly just about identifying red flags and are mostly useless for identifying good candidates, so I wouldn't worry too much about that. Make sure the person knows how to program, look at their github depot, take them to lunch or coffee or a bar and see how their personality meshes with yours; that's enough.</p>\n",
            " <p>Most good programmers are already employed.  They're taking vacation time, realistically, to come to the interview.  You'd be asking them to take another vacation day to work with you (unless you plan on them doing their time-limited tasks after they put in a full day at their current employer).  Then you'd be asking them to take a week of vacation to work with you for a week which likely also takes some time to arrange.  And only then, after burning through a large chunk of their vacation hours, you would potentially offer them a probationary contract that would allow them to consider giving two weeks notice at their current employer.  That certainly reduces your risk of hiring someone that isn't going to be productive but it means that the candidate is taking a tremendous risk.  </p>\n\n<p>Of course, it creates a number of risks for you.  There is some intellectual property risk.  Depending on the candidate's current employment agreement, you might find that their current employer has rights to the code that they write for you.  There is a timing risk.  You're going to have to wait for them to arrange a vacation day and then to arrange a vacation week and then to put in their notice before they can stat their probationary contract.  That's a fair amount of waiting and coordinating.  If you're a slow-moving Fortune 500, that might not be a huge issue.  If you're a fast-moving startup, an interview process that stretches over a month or two would be problematic.</p>\n\n<p>If you decide that you'll only hire folks that are currently unemployed, which will severely restrict the pool of solid candidates, then you just have the logistical problems.  Getting a new employee set up is a fair amount of work particularly when you're going to measure their first day output and can't afford a hiccup when something doesn't work smoothly.  And there is a lot of employment paperwork that needs to happen to make sure that you do the proper witholding, send out the proper tax forms at the end of the year, you've got the appropriate NDAs an the like.  From the employee standpoint, the extra work involved in doing a single day of contract work may well cost them more in tax preparation fees than they'd make.  And that may interfere with their unemployment benefits.</p>\n\n<p>And unless you are doing something terribly repetitive and uninteresting, expecting someone to deliver a lot of value in a single day or a single week is probably optimistic.  People take time to come up to speed on an existing code base, understand your architecture, get their environment set up for maximum productivity, etc.  If you're just asking them to make small tweaks in very localized pieces of code based on fully developed specs, that might be enough time.  But that won't tell you a whole lot about their ability to do the more involved tasks that you're likely hiring them for.</p>\n",
            " <p>Go with a more 'normal' hiring process. Good employees are very wary about startups with unusual ways of doing things, most tend to 'unusual' themselves out of business (most startups fail).</p>\n\n<p>What you can do is use freelancers on specific portions and then if they measure up, offer them full time positions. Then you get the benefit of watching them do relevant work and you can analyse their work ethic, efficiency etc,. before hiring them. Basically works out the same as what you describe but without the hassles.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time use a normal hiring process to look for others. You're looking for someone reliable and competent, not an artist/genius type. The normal hiring process should show you who is/isn't (that's the reason people use it, that's what prospective employee's prepare for and it generally works).</p>\n",
            " <p>This 'one-day' stuff is not going to pan out.  Any seasoned developer worth his/her salt is only going to laugh at such an idea.  Additionally, I think it's advisable that you find out how much money it's going to cost you to get a person into a <strong>legitimate</strong> payroll system, do all the legal paperwork, locate desk space, and pay worker's compensation with the intent of having that all be in place for <strong>one</strong> day.  It is far from trivial and it's going to be a component for anybody running a business.</p>\n",

However, if the start-up succeeded, then I was happy if they joined the company full time during the day.</p>\n\n<p>When projects were small and just starting out, each start-up would be given shares just like a corporation that allowed me to take a critical few programmers and offer them some ownership. This does two things. It gives them a stake in the success of the company. It also gives them an incentive to take a chance even for less money.</p>\n\n<p>However, to do this, you must be a good salesman, choose the very best of the best technologists you have access to, be able to consistently motivate and keep peoples interest, deliver a product in a timely manner, and finally, be truthful and trusted. These are good leadership skills you will need anyway so going through this process is extremely good exercise for the future. It is also not as easy as people think.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, the normal hiring process is fraught with risk. Hiring people you know and trust is far easier. However, sometimes people will disappoint you. So make sure you have an out. Put it all in writing. Make it official.</p>\n\n<p><em>Here is an example.</em></p>\n\n<p>I had an idea for a new point of sale (POS) that exists today. Pioneering a comprehensive POS that manages the entire business chain did not exist at the time. I began working on the core of the product. After 6 months, I hired a friend and gave him %50 of the product due to the level of participation he was engaged in. I needed the 6 months to create a proof of concept that people can see. It was a working product, even if it was not complete. When we needed expertise and help, we would peel off a small percentage of ownership for key programmers that filed in the gaps. This was from 1% to 5% max. We kept the personnel head count very lean. In the end, the intent was to sell the product to someone already in the business which we did. Each earned a significant income within a year. My primary partner and I earned our yearly income in just one year of part-time programming rather easily. We were highly paid at the time so it was a real boost!</p>\n",

        "sft_target": " <p>Most good programmers are already employed.  They're taking vacation time, realistically, to come to the interview.  You'd be asking them to take another vacation day to work with you (unless you plan on them doing their time-limited tasks after they put in a full day at their current employer).  Then you'd be asking them to take a week of vacation to work with you for a week which likely also takes some time to arrange.  And only then, after burning through a large chunk of their vacation hours, you would potentially offer them a probationary contract that would allow them to consider giving two weeks notice at their current employer.  That certainly reduces your risk of hiring someone that isn't going to be productive but it means that the candidate is taking a tremendous risk.  </p>\n\n<p>Of course, it creates a number of risks for you.  There is some intellectual property risk.  Depending on the candidate's current employment agreement, you might find that their current employer has rights to the code that they write for you.  There is a timing risk.  You're going to have to wait for them to arrange a vacation day and then to arrange a vacation week and then to put in their notice before they can stat their probationary contract.  That's a fair amount of waiting and coordinating.  If you're a slow-moving Fortune 500, that might not be a huge issue.  If you're a fast-moving startup, an interview process that stretches over a month or two would be problematic.</p>\n\n<p>If you decide that you'll only hire folks that are currently unemployed, which will severely restrict the pool of solid candidates, then you just have the logistical problems.  Getting a new employee set up is a fair amount of work particularly when you're going to measure their first day output and can't afford a hiccup when something doesn't work smoothly.  And there is a lot of employment paperwork that needs to happen to make sure that you do the proper witholding, send out the proper tax forms at the end of the year, you've got the appropriate NDAs an the like.  From the employee standpoint, the extra work involved in doing a single day of contract work may well cost them more in tax preparation fees than they'd make.  And that may interfere with their unemployment benefits.</p>\n\n<p>And unless you are doing something terribly repetitive and uninteresting, expecting someone to deliver a lot of value in a single day or a single week is probably optimistic.  People take time to come up to speed on an existing code base, understand your architecture, get their environment set up for maximum productivity, etc.  If you're just asking them to make small tweaks in very localized pieces of code based on fully developed specs, that might be enough time.  But that won't tell you a whole lot about their ability to do the more involved tasks that you're likely hiring them for.</p>\n",

            " <p>Do you learn from this guy?</p>\n\n<p>I have been in a similar situation, being talked down to etc, but the individual also taught me a lot, albeit in a condescending way.</p>\n\n<p>I rejected this person at the time as I felt that they were targeting me specifically. I only saw the negative and I wish I could go back and let them know that I have changed my view, but some people, especially in IT, aren't the most people friendly, and learning how to work with those people is a skill in itself which can be rewarding too as there is often a lot to learn from them.</p>\n\n<p>My point is that if you find that you do learn and improve as a result of this person, who it sounds like is taking a special interest in you, then it might be an idea to learn to cope with their personality and use this as an opportunity to become a better developer.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, when somebody sees potential in somebody else and they know that the person could do better, they express this in less than ideal ways.</p>\n\n<p>If not, then maybe start looking for another job.</p>\n",
            " <p>\"How can I get the point across to him while keeping it professional?\"</p>\n\n<p>Does he tell you the same things over and over,  indicating that he isn't paying attention to what you are saying?  A gentle reminder might be in order (gravely nod and say \"yes, I remember you telling me that yesterday.\") and fast forward him to what you need to learn(...and what I'd really like to know is...\")</p>\n\n<p>Or is he covering new ground, just things you already know?  If this is the case, just nod and wait until he takes a breath or there is a polite point of entry into the conversation, and ask him about some aspects of the process that you <em>don't</em> know.  Find ways to learn more than you already know.  He's a senior level guy; if you can't find ways to steer him into giving you useful information then it sounds as if you are more concerned with what you already know than what you don't know.  That's an attitude that could be deadly to your career.</p>\n\n<p>Many times on job interviews I have been given questions to answer and I could not answer them; often I find out that what they really wanted to know was how I reacted when I didn't know the answer.  Often, what you know isn't as important as how well you learn, and how you react to instruction.  Especially when you are only 24 years old.  If that last statement stung a bit, it sounds as if you may be partly causing your own problem.</p>\n\n<p>Push yourself to learn more.  Go to your coworker with more advanced questions.  That's the best way to divert him from the basics; prove that you are ready and able to discuss advanced concepts.  And above all, focus on what you want to learn, <em>not</em> what you know.</p>\n\n<p>\"Or, perhaps, how can I keep my sanity and feeling of self worth if he continues?\"</p>\n\n<p>You can keep your sanity by not basing your feelings of self worth on whether or not this guy you work with acknowledges how much you know, and instead focus on doing your job, improving and getting along with people.  I don't think there is anyone, anywhere who is appreciated as much as they feel they deserve.  And people who focus on getting respect rather than deserving it spend their whole lives chasing the wind.</p>\n",
            " <p>The short answer is you have to take control of the conversations.  You have allowed him to have control.</p>\n\n<p>Begin by asking very pointed, direct questions, and even then only when necessary.  If you ask open-ended questions, he is (apparently) the type that will take that opportunity to lecture.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of asking \"How does the consumables tracking module work with the client billing module?\"  ask him, \"Do you have the interface specification between the consumables tracking module and the client billing module?\"  Then if he starts to explain what consumables are or why you need to bill the client, you have every reason to say, \"I hate to interrupt, but I'm already familiar with both the systems, and I'd really like to get working on this interface issue right away.  Can you please give the the interface specification.\"</p>\n\n<p>Obviously that's pretty specific for the purpose of an example, but by tightening the focus of your questions, you demonstrate your familiarity and competence with the technologies, and present yourself as a \"business-only, get-it-done\" type, which is not necessarily rare, but somewhat unexpected from your age group.</p>\n\n<p>If he's well-meaning, as you said you believe, a couple of weeks of this should change his dynamic with you.  If he's trying to prop himself up at your expense, then he'll soon see you as unsuitable for that purpose, and find a new \"apprentice.\"  Either way, he should stop treating you in the manner that you are frustrated by.</p>\n\n<p>If he does not, then you will have at least laid the groundwork for a complaint to your supervisor that your time is being wasted with \"Computer Science 131.\"</p>\n",
            " <p>My advice, to be blunt: suck it up.  If you like the job and the only problem is that a senior member of staff politely offers you guidance that you don't actually need, you should seriously consider that there is no such thing as a perfect job, and if it isn't this annoyance at the next job, it will be something else.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry to say it but you <em>are</em> still quite young and haven't even been there 6 months.  It will take time to prove your skill and knowledge and value to this team.  If you quit now you'll be the new guy on some other team, and you'll have to prove yourself to them.  </p>\n\n<p>So, get a thicker skin and don't let the fact that this guy doesn't think you know what you're doing bother you.  Answer <strong>politely</strong> with phrases like, \"thanks, I did know that\" or \"yes, I learned that a couple of years ago when working on X\" etc. and resolve not to let it bother you.  You can't control his actions, you can only control your own reactions. Don't get offended.  Just observe to yourself \"hmm, Larry still doesn't think I know how to do X -- that's silly since he knows I did Y at my prior company, which I couldn't have accomplished without knowing X.  Oh well, I guess he just wants to be sure.\"  And then stop thinking about it, don't obsess over it, don't try to get him to stop, don't try to barge in and finish his sentences.  Just let it go.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a mutual boss, you might also go to him/her and say something like \"Larry insists on continually giving me programming pointers that I don't need, and at this point I'm starting to find it a little insulting.  Is there any chance you could encourage him to lay off a bit?\"  If there isn't someone obvious to have this conversation with, revert back to \"suck it up\" and manage your reaction. </p>\n",
            " <p>Reverse it, and start teaching him how to do his job at the most fundamental level. Randomly explain to him what a method is.  When any opportunity arises, explain to him why you'd declare a variable as an int instead of a String. Explain to him the order of operations. Have a heart to heart to him as to why it's good to declare constants instead of having numbers throughout your code. Each time he offers you basic, unsolicited advice make sure you give him 2 ridiculous suggestions that same day. Within a week he'll stop.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: There was some element of hyperbole in there, but I've dealt with the type of people the OP has talked about. He has tried to discuss this head on, and that hasn't worked.We tried the same thing. He would talk down to us truly in our best interests he thought, and he meant well, but no matter what we said he would keep doing it.Finally as a joke someone said let's do the same thing to him, and for a week or 2 everyone would explain to him how to use for loops, the differences between MySQL engines, etc.He got the point and then some. He never fully stopped but for sure it decreased </p>\n",
            " <p>As a Senior / Lead Developer with a management degree here's the best way I've found and tested many times to deal with this sort of situation - assuming the person you're dealing with isn't just being evil.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Walk up to this guy and say \"Do you have fifteen minutes we could chat about something?\".</li>\n<li>Find an area out of the general flow of people (conference room is best if those are available) - Never give this sort of feedback in a public area; he'll get defensive and it won't have the intended effect of curbing the behavior.</li>\n<li>Use this formula: \"Lately it feels like you've been doing a lot of X.  When you do X it does Y.\"  </li>\n<li>In your case its; \"Lately it feels like you've been trying to help me out with a bunch of fundamental things I already know.  When you tell me things I already know, it makes me feel as though you don't value the experience that I do have which makes it harder to improve based on your feedback\".</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Bam.  This generally works for most level headed reasonably not-evil people.  If he is actually being a jerk about it; its time to raise that concern with your manager.</p>\n\n<p>He also may genuinely think you are at that level; which actually talking to him like this may help to change.  A lot of times its hard for seniors or leads to gauge where a developer is at; unless they have personally spent a fair amount of time with the person (or interviewed them for this purpose).</p>\n",
            " <p>The guy is possibly insecure, probably alot less paid than you and frustrated. His behaviour may be genuine but it definitely makes him feel senior to you, especially if someone overhears him 'coaching' you. I've been (and in many ways still am) in a similar situation. I just grinned and beared it for a while but that didn't work. Then I spoke to him about it. That worked for a week. The tipping point came when he actually complained about me as I was ignoring him more and more ( ' I'm too busy etc' ). Fortunately at that moment I'd gathered enough qudos on successful projects with the manager that the guy got shot down and put in his place after the next meeting. At which point I rather condescendingly put the boot in suggesting to my manager that perhaps his lack of professional behaviour was because he is frustrated about his job (which I genuinely believe). He is now known as someone who exhibits unprofessional behaviour and lost alot of respect. I defended his work recently to my manager and he thanked me for it. Which possibly even confirmed my 'seniority' over him, I don't know time will tell. But I also discovered that he has a very good reason to be frustrated, which means I've far more patience with him.</p>\n\n<p>There is no easier way to handle your situation as everyone is different. At the end of the day you've just got to be as professional and polite as possible. That doesn't mean you have to listen, especially if you are busy.</p>\n\n<p>Actually I just thought, maybe its even one of his objectives to 'coach' you!!\nIn that case maybe there is something else you can learn from him and ask him to redirect his 'coaching' to that instead. </p>\n",
            " <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Ask advanced questions.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I know how you feel as I, too, don't like it very much when someone tries to teach me something I <em>believe</em> I can teach others. I'm a dev, too.</p>\n\n<p>Let me sum up my perspective here:</p>\n\n<p>You say you are a dev. Being a dev means one and only one thing for sure: <em>there's always plenty to learn regardless of how much you already know</em>. </p>\n\n<p>You say that your <em>colleague</em> is a senior dev and you aren't yet you are on the same level in the team.</p>\n\n<p>Your colleague doesn't mean it to insult you when he gives you unsolicited advice. You think he means well.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, he is a senior in the company and that should mean that he knows things worth learning - you <em>too</em> want to be a senior dev some day, preferably some day soon. </p>\n\n<p>So, here's what I would do if I were you:</p>\n\n<p>Count to ten and in meantime try to control my anger and hurt feelings. </p>\n\n<p>and finally <strong>ask advanced questions</strong> once your coworker is done with the basics.</p>\n\n<p>My short and simple experiences as a dev tell me that <strong>nothing can gain you respect faster and easier than asking <em>good</em> questions</strong>. If you don't have questions, find a hole in your expertise you want to patch - I'm sure there's more than one. Then start asking.</p>\n\n<p>This will have some positive side-effects: you can get on good terms with your colleague very quickly. The willingness to help out will be used for good, and you'll learn new stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Or you'll come to discover that the basic level of advice is all your coworker is capable of and he'll bother you no more when he's failed to answer two or three well aimed questions of yours.</p>\n",
            " <p>There seems to be a bit of a case of narcissistic injury here. I understand why it might be frustrating to be have someone explain the basics to you when at your level you will have a firm grasp of them. You shouldn't let this turn into irritation towards the person trying to help you however. You do not know everything at this point so you are going to get advice and tips from time to time, a lot of them will be things you already know.</p>\n\n<p>I think the problem with this individual is he doesn't believe you're a professional. I'm sure there is some blame on his end, judging you by your age or not taking the time to learn your experience, but it may be you need to present yourself more professionally as you mentioned. </p>\n\n<p>Should he bring up a basic topic, respond with \"Yes, I've actually worked on this before in a similar situation X years ago.. have you thought about this approach?\" and give an example of your experience (without interrupting him). This will help show the person that you know your stuff and whether they continue to offer simple advice or not it will improve your relationship with them.</p>\n\n<p>It might be they're just the type who likes to offer a lot of advice and doesn't expect people to take offense. You may just have to get used to it and if that doesn't seem like an option you're just going to have to air it out with them, politely ask them to hold back on the advice as you see it as a distraction or unnecessary, being direct without being offensive and avoiding any passive-aggressive or petty responses.</p>\n\n<p>HTH</p>\n",
            " <p>You are describing what could be a paradigm shift: In his mind he may just be trying to be helpful, and he is unaware that he is making you feel talked down to. He may also just have the bad habit of being condescending to less senior people to try to assert his dominance. </p>\n\n<p>He should be paying more attention to your reaction and body langue and see if he is offending you. The fellow may not have highly developed social skills. You might want to try asking someone else what they think of him and they may confirm he is just condescending. </p>\n\n<p>Some people don't like to be given unsolicited advice. Giving poor or unsophisticated unsolicited advice is then adding injury to insult.</p>\n\n<p>This simplest thing to do is to politely and kindly tell him when he talks to you that way, you feel talked down to, and you don't like it. If you become hostile or aggressive during this conversation you may further strain your relationship. When you talk to him watch his face closely. Is he getting mad or frustrated or does he look concerned or apologetic?</p>\n\n<p>If he responds with anything but an apology then he has poor social skills, is trying to exert some lame dominance over you, or he is just condescending.</p>\n\n<p>Really it just sounds like he has poor social skills and is not up to speed on the principles and benefits of engagement. Proceed gently because he is in fact handicapped.</p>\n",
            " <p>Does he do this just to you, or to everyone?</p>\n\n<p>This may be a specific technique of keeping the team on the same page.  Those things you think are simple and basic - I guarantee there's some 30% of programmers out there that don't believe/agree with them. He may simply be showing agile team leadership by continuing to restate core values. This provides an opportunity for you and the rest of the team to either reinforce (\"Yes, we should always write unit tests\") or open for discussion (\"Well, but actually there is such a thing as too many unit tests\"). </p>\n\n<p>As you are new, he may be making sure to run through all the various existing shared team values to see if you're all on the same page and you are misinterpreting that badly. It definitely sounds like you are younger and value the independence part of the job more than the team part of the job. You should carefully reevaluate his statements through this lens, because from the agile engineering team manager point of view, \"great programmer who doesn't work well with his team\" is \"someone we regret more having to let go.\"</p>\n\n<p>Obviously just having a direct discussion with him about \"hey you keep telling me basic things and it makes me feel like you think I'm a dope, what's up with that\" will bring his real motivations out - I am not sure why you didn't do this within a week of this starting to bug you, and it reinforces my thoughts that something like the above dynamic is really in play here.</p>\n"

        "sft_target": " <p>My advice, to be blunt: suck it up.  If you like the job and the only problem is that a senior member of staff politely offers you guidance that you don't actually need, you should seriously consider that there is no such thing as a perfect job, and if it isn't this annoyance at the next job, it will be something else.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry to say it but you <em>are</em> still quite young and haven't even been there 6 months.  It will take time to prove your skill and knowledge and value to this team.  If you quit now you'll be the new guy on some other team, and you'll have to prove yourself to them.  </p>\n\n<p>So, get a thicker skin and don't let the fact that this guy doesn't think you know what you're doing bother you.  Answer <strong>politely</strong> with phrases like, \"thanks, I did know that\" or \"yes, I learned that a couple of years ago when working on X\" etc. and resolve not to let it bother you.  You can't control his actions, you can only control your own reactions. Don't get offended.  Just observe to yourself \"hmm, Larry still doesn't think I know how to do X -- that's silly since he knows I did Y at my prior company, which I couldn't have accomplished without knowing X.  Oh well, I guess he just wants to be sure.\"  And then stop thinking about it, don't obsess over it, don't try to get him to stop, don't try to barge in and finish his sentences.  Just let it go.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a mutual boss, you might also go to him/her and say something like \"Larry insists on continually giving me programming pointers that I don't need, and at this point I'm starting to find it a little insulting.  Is there any chance you could encourage him to lay off a bit?\"  If there isn't someone obvious to have this conversation with, revert back to \"suck it up\" and manage your reaction. </p>\n",
        "rejected_target": " <p>Reverse it, and start teaching him how to do his job at the most fundamental level. Randomly explain to him what a method is.  When any opportunity arises, explain to him why you'd declare a variable as an int instead of a String. Explain to him the order of operations. Have a heart to heart to him as to why it's good to declare constants instead of having numbers throughout your code. Each time he offers you basic, unsolicited advice make sure you give him 2 ridiculous suggestions that same day. Within a week he'll stop.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: There was some element of hyperbole in there, but I've dealt with the type of people the OP has talked about. He has tried to discuss this head on, and that hasn't worked.We tried the same thing. He would talk down to us truly in our best interests he thought, and he meant well, but no matter what we said he would keep doing it.Finally as a joke someone said let's do the same thing to him, and for a week or 2 everyone would explain to him how to use for loops, the differences between MySQL engines, etc.He got the point and then some. He never fully stopped but for sure it decreased </p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Just now I have been promoted as Team lead and from Senior Web Developer. Actually I have been promoted due to my good technical knowledge, but now my managers expectation are very high as \"Team Lead\". The issue is that in my previous week I have given one task estimation and that estimation was judged as Over Estimate and now my manager has forgot my all good work and only recalling overestimation thing in each every discussion. I am feeling bad that how one mistake can erase all good things. Actually I want to learn the professional way to handle such situation.</p>\n\n<p>So my question here is how to handle scenarios like on I mentioned above ?</p>\n\n<p>How to handle project manager who is always on fire now?</p>\n\n<p>I am loosing my interest of work due to this issue ?</p>\n\n<p>Even she is criticizing now on my every task and judging me like a hell.(she is non technical) </p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

However, the roles you are in are changed now, whereas as a developer senior or not, your quality is perceived in terms of work done as a team lead your quality is perceived in terms of the work the team does. </p>\n\n<p>Your manager's quality is perceived in terms of the work that all his team leads do. So by picking up on something that is (percieved as) an overestimate and reminding you of it, they are trying to get you to give lower estimates for you and your team and essentially to get your team to do more work. </p>\n\n<p>In short, they are playing games and manipulating you. It would be interesting to see how the work you underestimated actually came out in terms of effort and quality once it was done.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to counter this is with hard facts, look at your teams' estimates and effort, calculate how accurate they are on average. Use that to look at how future estimates are done. So next time your Manager uses this one issue to pressure you you can say that on average estimates come out X% accurate.</p>\n\n<p>Also if your manager is any good, they will know that estimating work is never a science people will use their understanding of the problem and past experience to do a best guess. A manager who expects every estimate to be accurate is not a very good manager. You could start to remind them of this if they push too hard. </p>\n"
