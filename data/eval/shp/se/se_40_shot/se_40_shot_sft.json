You will not be able to use the degree to pursue advanced study anywhere in Germany, and gaining employment with that kind of grade will be a lot more difficult.</p>\n\n<p>You will want to check the <em>Pr\u00fcfungsordnungen</em> (examination rules) for your program to determine if you are allowed to resubmit or repeat the master's thesis, rather than take a grade that low on the thesis. In that case, you may find that option preferable to having to deal with the consequences of a D on the thesis.</p>\n"

(b) The project tries to solve two different problems.</li>\n<li>The second issue is that I'm not interested in the field of the project. My interest is in a different field. Though, both are related to computer science.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So, would participating in this paper do any harm to my reputation or my chances of getting into a good graduate program in the field I'm interested in?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thank you so much for the kind answers. Almost all of you agree that the second issue is harmless, but there are different opinions regarding the first one.</p>\n\n<p>So I said that my supervisor knows better, and I decided to go on and started planning the outline of the paper with his help. When I got to the writing part, I noticed that the main body doesn't relate to or even mention the main problem that we've specified. This is when I decided to decline the offer.

The staff member apparently gave her a \"funny look\", which confirmed the postdoc's view that this staff member is abusing their position of privilege. Anyone who points out that this is a total non sequitur is accused of allowing bullying to flourish. </p>\n\n<p>This situation has been building steadily over the last few years and now five or six postdocs keep a running tally of \"microaggressions\" so microscopic that it is very difficult to see how they can exist. For example, one postdoc sits with their back to a door, and a professor came in to talk to another colleague, and didn't acknowledge them. This incident was talked about for weeks as evidence of the professor's \"rudeness\". In other cases, some people are labelled \"creeps\".</p>\n\n<p>To be clear: I absolutely do not condone abuse. I know power dynamics are real, and that many minorities (of which I belong to several) experience daily microaggressions and othering. I have been on the receiving end of workplace bullying myself, and would never wish to silence real problems. I too am a postdoc, so have no additional power and gain nothing from allowing abuse to flourish.</p>\n\n<p>What worries me is that none of these incidents are being raised with any of the staff members in question. Therefore, many junior researchers have accepted as fact that their professors are horrible and selfish people. I'm concerned about this mindset, because in at least three cases, these \"selfish\" professors have some form of autism (I know this as I'm a wellness officer). Perfectly ordinary behaviour is framed as malicious.</p>\n\n<p>Personally I've found it very upsetting. Many of the people on the receiving end of this gossip are very kind, if not socially awkward, people. It scares me that so many people uncritically accept that everyone with a permanent job is some kind of bogeyman; of course, I cannot betray confidentiality by informing my colleagues that many of these incidents didn't occur and indeed it's kind of ableist to assume you can read minds all the time. Abuse and power struggles certainly can, and often do, occur... but if any of these complaints were substantial they should be raised with HR. </p>\n\n<p>The sad truth is that I think my colleagues just get their power from trash talking others, and aren't actually interested in the truth. Dissenting voices get shunned (and accused of being privileged / not being woke). Anyone who isn't in 100% agreement gets immediately shut down. But, also, my colleagues are just upsetting themselves for no reason. They're scared of encountering these \"terrifying\" professors, most of who have done nothing worse than dressing slightly shabbily and being uncomfortable with eye contact. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone have any advice on dealing with this kind of situation?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

Being a naive undergraduate, I knocked on proffessor's doors, asking for a supervisor, and one of them, very generously agreed. He suggested a problem I thought was interesting and so I started the research. I originally started throwing analysis at the problem, and started trying to solve some really complex differential equations (which kept me motivated). However I did not make much progress, so after my supervisor marked that I needed to get something, I fully changed my approach and started using some geometric approximations to solve the issue. This generated some results, but was too simple. I'd like to say that my results were inversely proportional to how much effort I was putting in the research.</p>\n\n<p>Time passed, I had multiple potential solutions and a way to evaluate them. On the last week before the final submission I realised there was a bug in my code base that was destroying the results (they were mathematically impossible). I tried to find the error, but the best I could do was identify an area where a mistake could have happened. </p>\n\n<p>Finally I got my evaluation on the course after presenting it. The feedback said the methods were a bit naive and could be improved on, and it was dissapointing that I didn't get numerical results (I had visual results, not numerical), however since I was not a seasoned researcher they decided to be lenient and gave me an A anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I applied to the grad program at my university, and asked the same proffessor to be my supervisor for the grad program. I am in desperate need of financial support until the grad program starts, and so my supervisor said I could do summer research for him and in the meanwhile we could discuss what the grad project could be. What he wants me to do is finish my previous work and get a publication. </p>\n\n<p>The issue is that I legitimately feel that dinking bleach would be more motivating (I am using this metaphor to convey just how much anxiety this is giving me). This research really does not appeal to me in any way or form, and the interesting part is over, all that is missing is finding the bug, which could take more than two weeks to solve and implementing a couple of modifications to make my naive methods less naive if things go well, or complete failure to finish it in the worst case.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to that I have been doing independent research simultaneously as I have been taking courses and doing everything else. Although this independent research still needs a lot of work, it's in a good place, I have already improved many of the papers I have read and have multiple ideas to explore. In an ideal world I would win the lottery tomorrow and I could just support myself while I carry on with this research.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure how to approach my supervisor and tell him I don't want to finish this research, nor how to suggest to do my research instead and get a publication out of that, or even if I should touch on this topic at all.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

It is important to find out how long you still need, and only then (if still applicable - maybe it's a two-week bug fix that doesn't feel like drinking bleach) have a discussion with your supervisor. You can bring up your independent research during that discussion as well - either as an alternative or as a next project.</p>\n"

Unless their Bachelor/Masters program specificaly teaches how to work in academia, they will have absolutely no idea. At our university only psychology students actually understand the scientific method, and only molecular medicine/biochem students are prepared to work in their respective fields. The rest learns facts and math. What I mean by that specifically is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They do not know how a paper is structured and why it is done the way it is in your field. What belongs in the introduction? What belongs in the discussion? Andy why? Etc. Take a good paper, and go through it. Then take a couple of bad ones (maybe student submissions), and make them point out mistakes to them.</li>\n<li>How do you find a research idea? (Relevant only after the first project)</li>\n<li>How do you actually research a question? Some might never have used google scholar, and do not even know that you can look up &quot;cited by&quot;. Why should you always try searching for a review? How do you stay up to date in a field? What are the top journals/people to pay attention to?</li>\n<li>What tools are there? They might be obvious to you, but they are not to them. Google Scholar, Connected Papers, Zotero with all Plugins, etc. Whatever you use, show them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, to start them off, give them a clear project, with a clear goal.

My prof wanted to see an almost polished version of everything, which meant that I wasted so much time ...</p>\n<p>Once they wrote the first paper, they probably should be able to come up with original ideas and be very productive, and you will not need to guide them, but will be instead working as peers.</p>\n<p>Make sure they are not afraid to come to you with ideas.

Countries near the bottom of this ranking have the feature that most if not all of their main institutions experience high levels of dishonesty and unethical behavior.

The forces you are trying to fight are so much bigger and more powerful than you, that unless you are willing to dedicate your entire life to fighting them, knowing that you will achieve either nothing or very little, your only other choice would be to keep your head down, either ignore or join in the cheating, and resign yourself to a life of dissatisfaction and unfulfilled dreams.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry it's pessimistic and depressing, but there it is.

After doing this you will be presented with the option of using both drives for Time Machine backups or change the existing drive. If you select the option of using two separate drives, the Time Machine backups will alternate destination drives for each backup.

There seems to be no rhyme or reason to it. In iCal they are in a perfectly logical, organized order.  When I go to print, they appear randomly mixed around.</p>\n\n<p>I have attached some photos: The first is from iCal, second is what the pdf looks like. Note that not only does it re-order the events from the way they appear in iCal, but the way it is re-ordering the events appears to be changing at random from day to day: compare the blue events on the 17th and 24th in image 2 - these events are repeating weekly events and were not entered into the calendar manually. There is absolutely nothing different about the events on the 17<sup>th</sup> and the 24<sup>th</sup>, yet they appear in a different order on each of those days. The orange events are not repeating events and were each entered manually on their given days, but they too are being re-ordered randomly from day to day. I've noticed that this isn't just an issue for all-day events - the exact same problem occurs when multiple events occur at the same time (8am, for example).</p>\n\n<p>Has this just been accepted as an unfixable issue? Super frustrated, spent hours putting a year-long call schedule together for my residency program only to find it's a confusing mess when I try to print it or turn it into a PDF.

Install the dependency by:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt install libspa-0.2-bluetooth\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Now, to install the client libraries:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt install pipewire-audio-client-libraries\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Reload the daemon:</p>\n<pre><code>systemctl --user daemon-reload\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Disable PulseAudio:</p>\n<pre><code>systemctl --user --now disable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you are on Ubuntu 20.04, you also need to \u201cmask\u201d the PulseAudio by:</p>\n<pre><code>systemctl --user mask pulseaudio\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I am not sure but, if possible, you can try to run this on other versions too.<br>\n9.     After a new update of Pipewire, you also need to enable <code>pipewire-media-session-service</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>   systemctl --user --now enable pipewire-media-session.service\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li><p>You can ensure that Pipewire is now running through:</p>\n<pre><code>pactl info\n</code></pre>\n<p>This command will give the following output, in Server Name you can see:</p>\n<pre><code>PulseAudio (on PipeWire 0.3.28)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Things should be working by now and you can see your microphone.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If it doesn\u2019t show up, then try restarting Pipewire by this command:</p>\n<pre><code>systemctl --user restart pipewire\n</code></pre>\n<p>If it\u2019s still not showing your microphone, you can try rebooting once and remove and pair your Bluetooth device again to check if it works now.</p>\n<p>I hope I have helped you solve your problem.</p>\n<p>If you want to rollback all the changes we did, you can do it by using:</p>\n<pre><code>systemctl --user unmask pulseaudio\nsystemctl --user --now enable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket\n</code></pre>\n"

I have tried taking LUKS out of the LVM and putting it on sda2, and the results were the same. I also know that the keyscript works because <code>cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/vg0/secure secure -d - &lt;&lt;&lt; \"$(/lib/cryptsetup/scripts/insecure)\"</code> works like a charm and decrypts my LUKS partition.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried this in Ubuntu 16.04.2 and Ubuntu Mate 16.04.2 with the same results. I've used keyscripts before without any trouble. The only difference was that, in the past, my / partition was always encrypted. If anyone can shed some light, I'd appreciate it. I only want a very small encrypted partition because I plan on cloning this system, and I don't want to clone it with the entire / partition encrypted.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2017-04-26</strong></p>\n\n<p>In digging through logs, I found a line with the following error which makes no sense.

In fact, I tried other options like keyfile-offset, and they work too. Hence, the problem lies somewhere with the keyscript option. Does anyone have any idea why?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

It should be noted that when I tested Vista, it worked fine.  The switch was to go to an OS that was a bit more modern, and to remove any crud from the previous owner.</p>\n<p>The problem that I have is that KDE regularly and randomly becomes unresponsive.  By unresponsive I mean the mouse moves, yet clicking on anything has no effect.  Keyboard input is ignored.  When this happens, the only course of action is to hit the power button to switch the machine off and then reboot it.</p>\n<p>I've switched over the compositor from OpenGL 2.0 to XRender.  For a brief while this appeared to help.  I've tried enabling the <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Backspace</kbd> key combination to kill the XServer session.  When it's locked up, that key combination does nothing.</p>\n<p>It is impossible to check resource usage because there is no way to get to a terminal or other application with the machine not responding to keyboard input or mouse clicks.  It is entirely possible it's related to RAM usage (it has the required 2gb minimum, I've got an upgrade coming, just need to wait for it to arrive) but it's really difficult to say that with any certainty at least until I can get it upgraded.  Having said that it can be as little as 30 seconds after login before the whole thing becomes unresponsive.</p>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, running this on Windows Vista appeared fine so it looks like its related specifically to the KDE installation.  And yes I know the machine is a little bit old, the whole purpose of the machine is as a portable word processing box so it hardly needs to be a powerhouse and I've always considered Linux a great option to extend the life of older hardware.</p>\n<p>Is the limited RAM situation likely to be the main cause of this, or are there other things I can investigate?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

After positioning her comfortable stool, she started to make a circular cut in the ice. Frighteningly, from up above, a voice boomed: 'There are no fish under the ice.' Startled, Mrs. Baker moved farther down the ice, poured herself a large coffee, and began to cut yet another hole. Again, from the heavens, the voice boomed: 'There are no fish under the ice.'  Mrs. Baker was now very concerned, so she moved way down to the opposite end of the ice, set up her stool, and began again to cut her ice-hole. The voice rang out once more: 'There are no fish under the ice.' Mrs. Baker stopped, looked upwards and said, 'Is that you Lord?' The voice replied, 'No, this is the ice-rink manager.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I found the above text in one of the past papers of the Kangaroo English competition.

However, if the goal is to signal the correct pronunciation, then \"Hanukah\" (or \"Hanukkah\"), while common, fails to capture the gutteral at the beginning of the word and beginning with \"ch\" is better.  I hear lots of people say the word with a soft \"h\", presumably because of this transliteration; it's clear what they mean but they're mispronouncing the word.</p>\n\n<p>If the purpose is to unambiguously indicate how the word is spelled in Hebrew, which is \u05d7\u05b2\u05e0\u05bb\u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4\u200e, then there are three problems:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The initial letter is one of two gutturals [*].  It's common to render that sound as \"ch\" (as in German), but that's ambiguous.  The academic-style transliterations that I've seen use \"ch\" for <em>chet</em> (the letter here) and \"kh\" for <em>khaf</em> (the other possibility).</p></li>\n<li><p>The final \"h\" is silent and is sometimes left off (\"Chanuka\"), but it corresponds to the Hebrew <em>hei</em> so include it.</p></li>\n<li><p>The <em>kaf</em>, corresponding to the \"k\" sound, has a dageish in the Hebrew.  A single \"k\" (\"chanukah\") would properly indicate that sound but would not necesarily make the presence of the dageish clear.  A common practice is to double consonants that hava a dageish; another example is the \"b\" in \"Shabbat\".</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So the most precise transliteration would be \"Chanukkah\".  However, many popular sources including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah\">Wikipedia</a> instead render it \"Hanukkah\".</p>\n\n<p>A final note: since the <em>nun</em> does not have a dageish, doubling the \"n\" isn't technically correct.  Nor does it convey anything about pronunciation.  So regardless of the other decisions you make, you should stick with one \"n\".</p>\n\n<p>[*] Yes yes, there are really five, but only two that make this particular sound.  I'm simplifying.</p>\n"

(Note that the noun forms of these adjectives won't work: <em>goodness</em> has a very wide range of meanings; <em>virtue</em> refers to qualities inhering in a person and carries no connotation of action unlike <em>virtuous act</em> which does, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>As you're writing for an Indian audience, the word you have in mind that's already familiar to your audience (<em>pun&#803;ya</em>) is a perfectly good choice to use. The criterion should not be whether a certain word exists in an English dictionary or not, but whether your audience will understand the word or not.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Further thoughts: English doesn't have have a word for the opposite of <em>sin</em>, because sin is a religious concept, and mainstream Christianity doesn't have a concept that's the opposite of sin; neither have English speakers found it necessary (<a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2009/08/14/we-are-all-hindus-now.html\">yet?</a> :p) to invent a word for the concept. In a non-religious framework for ethics, of course, there is no such thing as sin either; though certain acts may still be called <em>unethical</em> or <em>wrong</em> or by other terms.</p>\n\n<p>I'm no expert on Christian theology, but it seems that according to that framework, one is born in a state of some sin, and although one can commit further sins (acts against God's commandments), one cannot automatically reduce the effect of those sins simply by performing other good acts. Judaism has a concept of <em>mitzvah</em>, an act that carries out a commandment of God, which may be an opposite of <em>sin</em> in that sense. The concept you may be getting at, prominent in Indian religions (Hindu/Buddhist/Jain/Sikh) comes from a different model, in which there's something like a moral bank balance (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma\"><em>karma</em></a>) in which you can either lose credit through sin (<em>p\u0101pa</em>, acts against some cosmic order of right and wrong) or gain credit/merit through good deeds (<em>pun&#803;ya</em>).</p>\n\n<p>All that is not important, but if by the opposite of <em>sin</em> you're referring to something like the latter concept as informally understood by your audience\u2014with a slight theological connotation as something that brings merit to the doer\u2014then the term <em>pun&#803;ya</em> you were thinking of is precisely the right term to use. Using a generic phrase like \"good deed\" may not convey the intended meaning unless the context is understood (such as in translations etc., where \"good deed\" and \"meritorious act\" are indeed used).</p>\n"

Enlightening and evocative as the article is \u2014 with images of counterpanes and half-pairs, women\u2019s blouses and priests\u2019 collars, it\u2019s not difficult to imagine how such lists of clothing items could soon become deadly in their length and detail, especially to those reading or creating them for a living. Laundry lists of yore certainly wouldn\u2019t have made it onto today\u2019s Buzzfeed \u2013 the king of entertaining internet lists. No, it doesn\u2019t take a great leap of the imagination to see how our modern proverbial <em>laundry list</em> (ie. a tediously or unnecessarily lengthy list of items) was born from its literal forebear, which guaranteed efficiency and the return of freshly-laundered undergarments but not necessarily a basketful of laughs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.glossophilia.org/?p=3138\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Glossophilia</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Back then, before permanent press and abundant home washers, many people sent their clothes to a commercial laundry, where it was my job to mark it and sort it.</p>\n  \n  <p>The marking was to make sure the laundry got back to the right people, and the sorting was to make sure the right stuff got cleaned together in the big washing machines. Clothing dyes are much more color-fast now than they were then, and modern synthetic fabrics are much less fussy about water temperature than traditional cotton, linen and wool.</p>\n  \n  <p>So I had to learn many distinctions as I marked and sorted the clothes, sheets, towels, etc. Also, <strong>I had to record them on the \u201claundry list\u201d \u2014 a printed form</strong> that you filled out with the laundry mark and the quantity next to the appropriate category on the laundry list.<br>\n  [cont'd]   </p>\n  \n  <p><em>Origin of the laundry list</em><br>\n  <em>The Denver Post</em>, 2008,<br>\n  <sub>ED QUILLEN</sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=9dg6AQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22washing-list%22&amp;pg=RA1-PA8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22washing-list%22&amp;f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the printed list seems to have arisen in the late Victorian era</a>, the general concept is much older.

He also created the Stone Age \"language\" used in the film <em>Quest for Fire</em>, and wrote a critical exegesis of James Joyce's use of language (<em>Re:Joyce</em>).

These will tag you for bleeding damage while you are standing in them and then they pop you for 500-600 when they explode.  The only real strategy for these is to run away from them.

I used the aura that heals you when you use spirit and the one that gives you 100 extra spirit.  I don't think the mantras I had at this point are particularly useful for this fight, but I used the one that increases dodge to help with the first 2 stages.  I also used the aura companion spell and the heal party spell.  I had the enchantress follower with me.</p>\n<p>The basic strategy is to keep your spirit capped off, and as soon as you take damage, blow some spirit.   During the slow parts, run up to him and build your spirit back up.  Don't forget to use your potion if you get into trouble and don't worry about your companions, they will figure it out.  The last piece of advice is to not go crazy and blow all your heals when you take damage.  If he hits you with a whack as you are lighting up your spirit orb or you take a green spit, just cast a single damage spell that uses spirit and save the big cool downs for when you are running away from the green voids.</p>\n<p>Lastly, health globes do pop up in melee range quite often.

Merrill et al (1998) listed ten such equations, which included Maxwell's equations, the Navier-Stokes equation, and equations describing the gravity potential, the heat flow, and many other parameters.

Now there are some theories out there, a number of them a bit far-fetched, that speculate that maybe some of our constants have been evolving <em>extremely</em> slowly over billions of years, but certainly there has been no detected variation over the course of human scientific inquiry. Such a discovery would be huge, causing much agitation in all of physics and chemistry.</p>\n\n<p>It should also be noted that the bond angle can both be <em>calculated</em> from theory and <em>measured</em> from experiment, and neither method yields <em>exactly</em> $104.5^\\circ$. Now your theoretical calculations might improve if you make fewer simplifying assumptions than your predecessors, and your measurements might improve if you develop better apparatus and technique, but the true underlying value of the bond angle is not changing.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> Defined here as oxygen-16 bonded to two atoms of hydrogen-1. Now the angle could vary with isotopic abundances, so perhaps someone was referring to changing isotopic abundances of a source of water. You might see this, for instance, in <em>extreme</em> climate change, since as temperatures rise the fraction of \"heavy\" water ($\\mathrm{D}_2\\mathrm{O}$, etc.) evaporated from oceans increases relative to \"normal\" water.</p>\n"

I observe Alice moving toward me to the right at <span class=\"math-container\">$\\frac{3}{4} c$</span>, and I observe Bob moving toward me to the left at <span class=\"math-container\">$\\frac{3}{4} c$</span>.</p>\n<p>I can't directly measure the &quot;closing speed&quot; of Alice and Bob.  I can only measure the speed of each relative to myself.  If I also measure their positions, I could calculate the time until they collided.  But due to time dilation the &quot;time to collision&quot; will not be the same for all observers.</p>\n<h2>what does Alice measure?</h2>\n<p>The relativistic velocity addition rule comes from applying the Lorentz transformations for changes of coordinates to velocity vectors.  It tells us how to transform the velocity measured in one reference frame into another reference frame.  Starting from my observations we can transform each velocity into each other person's frame.</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$$u' = \\frac{u-v}{1-\\frac{uv}{c^2}},$$</span></p>\n<p>where <span class=\"math-container\">$u$</span> is the velocity measured in my reference frame, <span class=\"math-container\">$v$</span> is the relative velocity between my frame and another frame, and <span class=\"math-container\">$u'$</span> is the velocity measured in the other frame.  Lets say right is the positive direction.</p>\n<p>We can transform each of the three velocities I measured into Alice's frame.  From my measurements Alice's velocity is <span class=\"math-container\">$u_A = +\\frac{3}{4} c$</span>, which is also the relative velocity of her frame compared to mine <span class=\"math-container\">$v=+\\frac{3}{4}c$</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$$u'_A = \\frac{u_A - v}{1-\\frac{u_A v}{c^2}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{4}c-\\frac{3}{4}c}{1-\\frac{3^2}{4^2}} = 0$$</span></p>\n<p>So Alice measures herself to be at rest.  This makes sense.  Everyone is at rest in their own reference frame.</p>\n<p>How does Alice observe my motion?  We need to use the speed I measured for myself in my own frame, <span class=\"math-container\">$u_\\mathrm{me}=0$</span>.\n<span class=\"math-container\">$$u'_\\mathrm{me} = \\frac{u_\\mathrm{me} - v}{1-\\frac{u_\\mathrm{me} v}{c^2}} = \\frac{0 - \\frac{3}{4}c}{1-0\\cdot\\frac{3}{4c}} = -\\frac{3}{4}c$$</span>\nAlice measures me moving <span class=\"math-container\">$\\frac{3}{4}c$</span> to the left, toward her.\nThis again makes sense.</p>\n<p>Finally, how does Alice observe Bob?  I measured Bob moving at <span class=\"math-container\">$u_B = -\\frac{3}{4}c$</span>.\n<span class=\"math-container\">$$u'_B = \\frac{u_B - v}{1-\\frac{u_A v}{c^2}} = \\frac{-\\frac{3}{4}c-\\frac{3}{4}c}{1-\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}\\right)} = -\\frac{24}{25}c = -0.96c$$</span>\nAlice measures Bob moving <span class=\"math-container\">$\\frac{24}{25}c$</span> to the left, toward her.  This is correctly less than the speed of light.</p>\n<h2>proper velocity</h2>\n<p>Velocity isn't the only thing that transforms between reference frames.  Position and time measurements do, too.  Each observer may measure a different distance traveled and time elapsed.</p>\n<p>When I determined Alice's velocity, I used my meter stick (to measure <span class=\"math-container\">$\\Delta x$</span>) and my clock (for <span class=\"math-container\">$\\Delta t$</span>).  Her <strong>coordinate velocity</strong> in my reference frame is\n<span class=\"math-container\">$$v =\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}.$$</span>\nIf I measure myself to be <span class=\"math-container\">$3$</span> light-years from Alice, I would conclude it would take <span class=\"math-container\">$4$</span> years for her to get to me.</p>\n<p>A different way to define velocity is her <strong>proper velocity</strong>, which uses my meter stick, but her clock\n<span class=\"math-container\">$$v =\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta \\tau},$$</span>\nwhere <span class=\"math-container\">$\\tau$</span> is her <strong>proper time</strong> measured with her own clock.\nI observe Alice's clock to run slower than mine, so she will have aged less than <span class=\"math-container\">$4$</span> years when she arrives to me.\n<span class=\"math-container\">$$\\Delta\\tau = \\Delta t \\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 4\\,\\mathrm{yr} \\sqrt{1-\\frac{3^2}{4^2}} = \\sqrt{7}\\,\\mathrm{yr} \\approx 2.6 \\, \\mathrm{yr}$$</span>\nShe traveled <span class=\"math-container\">$3$</span> light-years by <strong>my meter stick</strong> in <span class=\"math-container\">$2.6$</span> years on <strong>her clock</strong>.  No one is actually moving faster than <span class=\"math-container\">$c$</span>.  It's just that this way of thinking about velocity is mixing different observers' measurements.</p>\n<p>Because time dilation depends on relative speed, Alice could age an arbitrarily small amount while traveling any distance, assuming she can go fast enough.</p>\n<p>It's important to remember that I measured her speed to be less than <span class=\"math-container\">$c$</span>. She also measured the relative speed between her and me to be less than <span class=\"math-container\">$c$</span>.  In her reference frame she is at rest, and I am moving <span class=\"math-container\">$\\frac{3}{4}c$</span> toward her.  Alice would observe that I arrive to her after <span class=\"math-container\">$2.6$</span> years on her clock, so I must have travelled <span class=\"math-container\">$$\\frac{3}{4}c\\cdot\\sqrt{7}\\, \\mathrm{yr} \\approx 1.98\\,c\\mathrm{yr},$$</span>\nso about <span class=\"math-container\">$2$</span> light-years.

Both have a hole and an electric field exists between the two plates. Now, let's consider an infinitely far away positively charged particule. Its potential energy is zero, same for its kinetic energy, thus its mechanical energy is also zero. My question is as follows. If the particule gets between the plates by the positive side, it now has potential energy, thus its mechanical energy increased. Where did that energy come from? Even worse, when the particule gets out by the other hole, it has kinetic energy, thus free work has been done by the plates. This is impossible and it seems to violate energy conservation. I'm not in the field of physics, just an engineering student but this is question has bothered me for some time. For example, I don't get why ion engines consume energy since it seems that accelerating particules with an electric field is free. One possibility would be that we need to expand energy to get the particules between the plates since their mechanical energy increases but I don't know where that would come from. What's the catch?</p>\n<p>Edit: When I'm saying two plates with a hole I mean something like that:\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/amBLb.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/amBLb.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>And the electric field between two finite charged plates is:\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/adovB.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/adovB.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

However, I never understood what is meant by \"speed\" or \"motion\" here. </p>\n\n<p>Specifically what confuses me is the idea of \"motion through time\". \"Speed\" to me normally means the rate in which an object varies in space over time, and to talk about something \"moving\" we talk about it changing it's position with respect to time.

For 2500, they give a length of over 371 days, and for 3000 they give over 738 days, which are obviously wrong results. These formulas for the sidereal year should be good for the short term, but should really only be used until more accurate versions of the procession and tropical year formulas are published in the coming decades.</p>\n<p>It feels incredibly good to finally find an answer over a year and a half after I originally asked the question.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sub>Citations:</sub><br />\n<sub>Barbieri, C., &amp; Bertini, I.

And this I got after thinking continuously for about 4 hours on the same question and I want to verify that if my ideology about this question is correct. First, what the question actually is?</p>\n<h1>Question</h1>\n<h3>Please refer to the diagram in image</h3>\n<h3>Explanation of the Image (You can skip this)</h3>\n<p>The image of the question is just below, please refer to it for better visualization. There are two blocks A and B. Block A has a mass of <span class=\"math-container\">$m$</span> while block two has a mass of <span class=\"math-container\">$2m$</span>. They are placed on top of each other. The surface between them (Block A and B) has a coefficient of friction <span class=\"math-container\">$\\mu$</span> and that between Block B and ground is <span class=\"math-container\">$2\\mu$</span>. In front of these two blocks is a wall that has a pulley attached to it (the wall). Now the block A is attached to a string which then runs over the pulley which is attached to the wall. And from that pulley, the string runs over another pulley which is attached to Block B and this string finally terminates getting attached back to the wall ( refer image for better visualization ). Now a force <span class=\"math-container\">$\\overleftarrow{F}$</span> is applied on the Block A.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rKalW.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rKalW.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Actual Question</h3>\n<p>What would be the minimum value of <span class=\"math-container\">$F$</span> so that the blocks start to move?</p>\n<h1>My Solution</h1>\n<h3>One Note Before Starting This</h3>\n<p>Whenever I say a force being &quot;paid by a system&quot;, I mean either it gets canceled by another force on the system or it gets exerted on the system. Also, the source of the force mentioned above in the main title of the question refers to the main force <span class=\"math-container\">$\\overleftarrow{F}$</span> acting on the system.</p>\n<h3>Now the solution</h3>\n<p>The most shocking thing I learned while solving this question was that the friction between block A and B will be paid two times all differently by the same force <span class=\"math-container\">$\\overleftarrow{F}$</span> acting in disguise on the two blocks. This was shocking as I first thought that the friction will be the usual force paid by the two blocks in some ration and not two times. But what I came to figure out was that it will be paid by each block separately and the amount of force of friction paid will be the same for two blocks and not in some ratio and those two will actually be the action-reaction pairs. One way we can thing about this is that the first block let's say starts moving in the left direction then it will exert a force of friction (which would be the reaction pair of the friction on block A) on the second block. Now to overcome this force the second block will pay the same amount of force in opposite direction. Hence the two pairs of force which are action-reaction pairs will be paid differently by each block. Now, these two pairs will be equal to <span class=\"math-container\">$\\mu N$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\">$N$</span> is the Normal force by Block A on B. And <span class=\"math-container\">$N = mg$</span>. Hence</p>\n<p>Friction b/w Block A and B <span class=\"math-container\">$ = \\mu N \\\\ \\rightarrow  \\mu mg$</span></p>\n<p>Friction b/w Block B and ground <span class=\"math-container\">$= 2\\mu N \\\\ \\rightarrow 2\\mu(3m)g \\\\  \\rightarrow 6\\mu mg$</span></p>\n<p><strong>For Block A</strong></p>\n<p>Now on block A, there is a force <span class=\"math-container\">$\\overleftarrow{F}$</span> and a friction <span class=\"math-container\">$\\mu mg$</span> which would be paid completely by this block so the tension <span class=\"math-container\">$T$</span> in the string would be</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$$ T = F - \\mu mg $$</span>\nLet's say this equation one.</p>\n<p><strong>For Block B</strong></p>\n<p>Now there is <span class=\"math-container\">$2T$</span> on block B and friction from the ground and surface above and remember that this block will pay its reaction pair separately. Hence</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$$ 6\\mu mg + \\mu mg = 2T $$</span></p>\n<p>Let's say this equation two.</p>\n<p>Analyzing equation 1 and 2 we get</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$$7\\mu mg = 2F - 2\\mu mg \\\\ F = \\frac{9\\mu mg}{2}$$</span></p>\n<h1>Final Question</h1>\n<p>Now here I want to ask that was this way of thinking correct or was it just a coincidence that I reached this solution? And thank you for spending your precious time on this question to help me out.

The answer usually cites Rayleigh scattering that I've checked on wikipedia: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering</a>:</p>\n\n<p>$$\nI=I_0 \\frac{1+\\cos^2\\theta}{2R^2}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right)^4\\left(\\frac{n^2-1}{n^2+2}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^6\n$$</p>\n\n<p>This answer raises more questions in my mind, that I hope some people can help to answer. </p>\n\n<p>First of all, I can't understand the $\\lambda^{-4}$ dependence in that equation. It means that the scattered intensity goes to infinity as $\\lambda\\to 0$. It also means that the observed intensity $I$ can be greater than the incident intensity $I_0$.</p>\n\n<p>On several web pages, the $\\lambda^{-4}$ dependence has been cited to explain why the sky is blue, but that doesn't make sense either. According to this reasoning the sky should be purple or indigo which has a higher frequency than blue. I've seen another explanation online that says that the sunlight impinging on our atmosphere has less indigo frequency than blue. However I can see the indigo part of a rainbow; it doesn't seem significantly dimmer than the blue part, so sunlight must have a decent indigo frequency content and as mentioned, the 4th power is a very strong dependency. This argument says that the sky ought to be indigo.</p>\n\n<p>A second question I have is concerning the angle dependency. $1+\\cos^2 \\theta$ has a maximum at zero and at 180, and a minimum at 90 degrees. According to this dependency the sky should look brightest when looking at 0 degrees (towards the sun), and 180 degrees (with the sun to your back), but it should have half the intensity at 90 degrees. This doesn't match with our experience of the sky. Given the hand-wavy nature of the explanations, I wonder if Rayleigh scattering truly is the explanation for why the sky is blue. </p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

Plus you confuse 1 scattering with the sum of scatterings along the line of sight.

The lower energy levels are filled, while the highest one can be not completely filled. The highest shell is called the valence shell; these are the most interesting for chemical bonds and reactions.</p>\n\n<p>If atoms are arranged in a crystal lattice, they are at very short distances from each other. The wave functions of the electrons overlap to some extent and there are a number of other interactions and disturbances (phonons, thermal variations, ...) that change the energy levels of each atom. In effect, this means that the valence band is not exactly at the same energy as for a free atom, but instead slightly higher or lower. Since there are on the order of $10^{23}$ atoms in a macroscopic crystal, there is a also consequently a large number of energy levels, all of which are very close together. This in effect looks and acts as a continuous energy <strong>band</strong>, not anymore as discrete, separate energy levels.</p>\n\n<p>However, it is important to note that this doesn't mean that the valence shell is broadened and forms the conduction band, or that the shell below the valence shell broadens and becomes the valence band.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, the valence shell and lower shell interact and form a new, hybrid shell. Each orbital in both shells is split in two, due to the Pauli exclusion principle. This combined band already contains $2N$ times as many states as a single, free atom has (where $N$ is the number of atoms in the lattice).</p>\n\n<p>This combined band is further separated into two parts by interactions between atoms in the crystal, so that conduction and valence band appear. The valence band is the band that lies below the Fermi energy, while the conduction band lies above it. During the splitting of the individual energy levels in the shells, the some levels of the valence shell can be higher (lower) than the Fermi level, so that they end up in the conduction (valence) band.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ctwYgm.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ctwYgm.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The electrical properties of solids can easily be described with this band model, without considering the individual energy levels of each single atom. For example, the separation between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied bands determines if the material is a insulator (large bandgap), semiconductor (small bandgap) or a conductor (no bandgap).</p>\n"

Indeed, whether encryption brings benefits or not depends on contextual characteristics such as the local backup policies.

So methods to prevent the malware from detecting it's inside a VM may not work, unless it's the type that self-destructs when detecting it. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding the \"attacks\" you've mentioned, let's take a look at the results of them, assuming you can remove the infections:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Zip bomb</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A zip bomb, also known as a zip of death or decompression bomb, is a malicious archive file designed to crash or render useless the program or system reading it. It is often employed to disable antivirus software, in order to create an opening for more traditional viruses.</li>\n<li>After removing the infection, the left-behind zip-bomb can be nullified by deleting the files. If you made this yourself, simply make a cleanup routine. If you didn't make it yourself, simply make a cleanup routine. If the program is still forcibly running, you can reboot. </li>\n<li>Won't cause physical problems with your hardware.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Fork bomb</strong> \n\n<ul>\n<li>In computing, a fork bomb (also called rabbit virus or wabbit) is a denial-of-service attack wherein a process continually replicates itself to deplete available system resources, causing resource starvation and slowing or crashing the system.</li>\n<li>Won't cause physical problems with your hardware.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Folder blaster</strong>.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Same concept as the zip bomb, but with folder spam. Just write a routine to delete them. </li>\n<li>Won't cause physical problems with your hardware.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Better yet, if you have a <code>virtual testing environment</code>, you can delete these automatically by saving the state of a virtual machine before the infection, and restoring it after you're done studying the output. This is the easiest, most efficient method by far. </p>\n"

                "content": " <p>The source of your confusion is an historical &quot;explanation&quot; of RSA signatures as being &quot;encryption of the hash with the private key&quot;. This explanation is confusing, and flawed in many ways. It works only for RSA. Actually it does not work for RSA either.</p>\n<p>Let's define things properly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>An <strong>asymmetric encryption</strong> system defines two functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Encrypt</code>: takes as inputs a <em>message</em> (a sequence of bytes, possibly limited in length) and a <em>public key</em>. It outputs a value in a given space of possible values (in the case of RSA, this is a big integer, no longer than the modulus).</li>\n<li><code>Decrypt</code>: takes as inputs an encrypted message (an output of <code>Encrypt</code>) and a private key, and produces back the original message (provided that the private key matches the public key which was used for encryption, of course).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>A <strong>signature algorithm</strong> defines two functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Sign</code>: takes as inputs a <em>message</em> (a sequence of bytes, usually not limited in length) and a <em>private key</em>. It outputs a value in a given space of possible values.</li>\n<li><code>Verify</code>: takes as inputs a message, a signature value (an output of <code>Sign</code>) and a public key, and outputs a boolean value (&quot;true&quot; on match, &quot;false&quot; otherwise).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since these four functions take different types of inputs and produce different kind of outputs, they cannot be swapped around.</p>\n<p>In general, asymmetric encryption algorithms and signature algorithms live in separate worlds. It so happens that there is an asymmetric encryption algorithm known as &quot;RSA&quot;, and there is a signature algorithm that is also known as &quot;RSA&quot;. Moreover, they both use the same kind of public/private key pairs. However, still generally speaking, encryption and signature keys <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/8559/digital-certificate-deployment-using-two-certs-for-each-user/8563#8563\">should be distinct</a>.</p>\n<p>If we look at the internals of RSA (both algorithms), as defined in <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3447\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PKCS#1</a>, then we may find some common elements, and others which are distinct.</p>\n<p>For <em>asymmetric encryption</em>, the message must be smaller (by at least 11 bytes) than the modulus. The message to encrypt is &quot;padded&quot; as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>0x00 0x02 rr rr ... rr 0x00 mm...\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <code>mm...</code> is the message, and the <code>rr</code> are random non-zero bytes. The number of <code>rr</code> bytes is adjusted so that the total length is equal to that of the modulus, and there must be at least eight such non-zero bytes (hence the restriction on the message length). The resulting sequence of bytes is <em>interpreted</em> as an integer modulo <em>N</em> (the &quot;modulus&quot; part of the public/private key pair), and raised to the public exponent modulo <em>N</em>. The result is the encrypted message: it is an integer modulo <em>N</em> (the convention is to encode that message in big-endian, yielding a sequence of bytes of the same length as the modulus).</p>\n<p>To give some numbers: if you use a 1024-bit RSA key, the modulus has size 128 bytes. Messages that can be encrypted must be no longer than 117 bytes. The encryption result is a sequence of 128 bytes.</p>\n<p>For signatures, the message that is to be signed is first hashed with a suitable hash function like SHA-256. Thus, arbitrarily long messages can be processed (SHA-256 has no practical limit on input length). The hash value is then padded, with a padding which looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>0x00 0x01 0xFF 0xFF ... 0xFF 0x00 ii... hh...\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <code>ii...</code> is a conventional header that designates the hash function, and <code>hh...</code> is the hash value. The number of 0xFF bytes is again adjusted so that the total length matches that of the modulus. The resulting sequence is again interpreted as in integer, and exponentiated modulo <em>N</em>, but this time the <em>private</em> exponent is used. Moreover, most RSA implementations actually optimize that operation by using the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chinese Remainder Theorem</a> through their knowledge of the factors of <em>N</em> (these factors are part of the private key).</p>\n<p>So, while both encryption and signature generation rely on some sort of padding followed by an exponentiation, they differ in significant ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>For encryption, the message is taken &quot;as is&quot; and is limited in length. For signature, the message is first hashed, and has no length limit.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The paddings differ. It is important for security that the padding used in encryption includes sufficiently many random bytes. It is equally important for security that the padding used in signatures includes sufficiently many non-random bytes. Less obviously, it is very important that the padding bytes occur &quot;on the left&quot; in the big-endian convention.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The exponentiations differ. For encryption, you use the public exponent, which is usually short (possibly down to e = 3, although the value e = 65537 is traditional)(as it happens, 65537 is used for no good reason at all, but hey, tradition is tradition). For signature generation, the private exponent is used, but the operation rarely use that exponent &quot;as is&quot;; in fact, two sub-exponentiations are done modulo <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> (the prime factors of <em>N</em>), for a total speed-up of about 4x.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In fact, the only really common point is that both RSA-encrypted messages and RSA signatures are integers modulo <em>N</em>, and are encoded with big-endian convention. Everything else differs. And, as I said earlier, you should not do signatures and encryption with the same key pairs anyway; both kinds of key pairs call for distinct management and lifecycles.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Some</em> implementations of signature generation/verification accept as input a pre-hashed value. The hash function is still an important part of the overall process. Even if a given piece of code accepts the hash value as input, the hash must still occur at some point.</p>\n<p><em>Some</em> implementations of the RSA signature verification algorithm actually on &quot;just&quot; the signature and the public key; instead of the simple boolean result (match/mismatch), they produce the hash value itself; the caller is then responsible for matching that hash value with the message that is purported to be signed. The ability to recover the hashed message from the signature+public key is a specificity of RSA (RSA is said to be a <em>signature algorithm with recovery</em>). Not all other signature algorithms can do that. And, again, it is important that the hash occurs; don't let it make you believe that you could do &quot;RSA signatures without hashing&quot;.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, RSA signatures used in SSL have relied on a slightly different procedure: the padding lacks the identifying header (the <code>ii...</code> in my notations), and the hash value is actually the concatenation of MD5 and SHA-1, both computed over the message that is to be signed. This is a remnant from a past where the PKCS#1 standard was not as firmly entrenched as it is today.</p>\n"

Thus after about 64,000 attempts a sophisticated brute forcer who tried this avenue of attack could arrive at <code>P[rmDrds,r</code>, so it's more accurate to estimate it's entropy as about 16 bits than 65.7 bits, which is 2<sup>65.7-16</sup> ~ 2<sup>49.7</sup> ~ 914 trillion times times easier to brute-force than the 65.7 bit password.</p>\n\n<p>Now, obviously some less-sophisticated brute force attacker might have ignored the possibility of shifting characters over on the keyboard one space to the left while going through common password lists. But to be safe you ignore dumb attackers and assume very sophisticated attacker has considered all of your methods of password generation (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kerckhoffs's principle</a> says avoid security by obscurity; assume the enemy has considered your secret technique among many other methods).  So when someone says you need a high-entropy password, your goal isn't a password that appears to be highly random (and some <a href=\"https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">simple password tester</a> labels it as high-entropy).  You want a random password that was built off of lots of random choices being input into your password generation procedure.  You should not pick meaningful words to you and make up a password for it with obscure tricks like shifting letters around or leetspeak substitutions.  For a strong password, you should rely on 80+ bits of non-human randomness being input into your procedure.  You should note that one bit of entropy in a password generation procedure is equivalent to a two-option decision (e.g., something that could be determined by a coin flip).</p>\n\n<p>And again, with very small likelihood you can randomly generate a password with a lot of random choices and it ends up a very weak password; e.g., it's technically possible that you randomly choose 12 characters and get <code>password1234</code> or <code>dddddddddddd</code>.  In practice, that's a possibility though it's unlikely to happen (e.g., if you use a procedure that generates an 90-bit password, the chance that it generated a password that also could have been generated with a simpler procedure with only 34-bits is 2<sup>34</sup>/2<sup>90</sup> = 1 in 2<sup>56</sup> which is roughly the odds of buying exactly two Mega Millions tickets in a row and winning the jackpot both times).</p>\n"

                "content": " <p>There are two parts to your concern about password length, the threat model and the rationale behind longer passwords.  As you state,  a lot of websites have protections against common attacks, and if the password database hasn't been leaked, your password isn't easily guessable, and online protections against brute-force protections are in place, longer passwords don't make much of a difference.  When those assumptions fail, long passwords can make sure your password is too expensive to crack, as demonstrated in research.  The more general case of this question, \"Why have strong passwords at all?\", is covered in <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/52031/why-does-password-strength-matter/52039\">this question.</a></p>\n\n<h2>Threat Model</h2>\n\n<p>The threat most password policies are concerned with is an attacker trying to crack the hash of the password which has been stolen or leaked from the system, also known as an offline attack.  This usually has some of the strictest requirements. However, these offline attacks aren't the only threat model.  You password could be compromised in other ways, like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Brute-force on the website itself, as you mentioned:  Most secure websites have protections against this, which are further discussed below. Long passwords do help you from online brute-force attacks, although the cost/attempt is much higher than an offline password cracker.  These kind of attacks are somewhat common.</li>\n<li>You reused a password and the password was compromised elsewhere:  The only prevention here is to not reuse passwords. Password length won't help here and too stringent of password requirements might even discourage users from setting a different password for each site.</li>\n<li>A friend, colleague, or social engineer is trying to guess your password based on their knowledge of you: While password length helps here, you don't need very long passwords to stop this attack, and often services are rate limited to only a few attempts per hour per computer.</li>\n<li>There are also methods like phishing, exploiting the password reset, and stealing a plaintext database. In all of those threats it doesn't matter how complicated your password is; it's gone anyways.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Focusing just on online attacks and limiting log-in attempts is bad practice because password database leaks do happen.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkj3n7/myspace-data-breach-427-million-passwords-available-online\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MySpace</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/07/adobe-password-leak-can-check\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Adobe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/31/dropbox-hack-passwords-68m-data-breach\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dropbox</a>, and others have all had password hashes stolen. You can check if you appear on any public leaks <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Don't Websites Block Online Brute-Force Attempts?</h2>\n\n<p>A major part of your question appears to be why password requirements are such a big deal if protections against brute-force attacks are in place.  PCI compliance, for example, requires account lock-out for at least 30 minutes after 6 failed attempts. The biggest problem in preventing these attacks is working against botnets with thousands of computers without causing a denial of service.  How do you prevent thousands of computers each trying to log in a few times without also locking out the user when they mistype their password while using a new computer, or using the same proxy as the botnet?</p>\n\n<p>There are other ways other than lockouts to <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/42271/how-can-you-i-detect-low-frequency-brute-forcing-over-multiple-connections\">rate-limit attackers, like asking for CAPTCHA</a>. However, there are <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448963/has-recaptcha-been-cracked-hacked-ocrd-defeated-broken/549859#549859\">some ways to work around CAPTCHA</a>.  This <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blocking_Brute_Force_Attacks\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OWASP page</a> discusses more of the best ways to block brute-force attacks.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Longer Passwords Help</h2>\n\n<p>A few decades ago when Unix was king, it was considered that five-character passwords <a href=\"https://spqr.eecs.umich.edu/courses/cs660sp11/papers/10.1.1.128.1635.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">were pretty good</a>.  Now the stakes are higher, advanced hardware is cheap, and hashes can be broken faster than ever so the requirements for good passwords are higher.  This is part of the reason more companies are pushing for longer passwords.</p>\n\n<p>Longer passwords help because the difficulty of password cracking goes up exponentially with password complexity.  <strong>Just adding one random word to your password can make it thousands of times more expensive to guess</strong>- the difference between seconds and hours of cracking time.  Adding another random word turns those hours into years.</p>\n\n<p>Many people advocate for using symbols and creating passwords from larger and larger character sets to make passwords more difficult to crack.  However, <a href=\"http://www.guanotronic.com/~serge/papers/chi11b.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">several</a> <a href=\"http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2012/papers/4681a523.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">examples</a> in <a href=\"http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2012/papers/4681a523.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">research</a> show that requiring longer passwords instead of very complex passwords leads to harder-to-crack passwords (and is more user friendly).  The longer passwords side was also famously supported by xkcd's <a href=\"https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/936:_Password_Strength\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"correct horse\" method to generate passwords</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One caveat is that longer passwords aren't always more secure since extra characters can make a password more predictable.  \"orrect horse battery staple\" is more secure than \"correct horse battery staple\", although the latter is much more memorable.  Good password meters like <a href=\"https://telepathwords.research.microsoft.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Telepathwords</a> or zxcvbn take this into account and will warn you when the extra characters are predictable.</p>\n\n<h2>How Long Should Passwords Be?</h2>\n\n<p>The specifics of how long your password has to be, and how hard it is to crack, can't be answered without knowing how your password is generated, how the password is hashed on the server, and the attacker's resources. For <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/144/how-long-should-the-password-be\">more details see this question</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I'll warn you, that password policy is a matter of opinion.  I've tried to show the best solution based on research, but there are some experts who disagree with me.</p>\n"

I have seen it be handled in two different ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The CA simply won't issue certs that outlive itself. Say you have a CA that issues 1-year certs. When the CA itself has less than a year on it they will stand up a new issuing CA. The old CA is still around for revocation checks and stuff, but no longer issues new certificates.</p></li>\n<li><p>Cross-certify the old CA with the new one so that when validating a cert issued by the old CA, it will chain to the current CA. This is a bit hacky because there is technically an expired CA in the chain. Most TLS engines do not support this kind of thing, so I have only seen it in closed environments like corporate email or ID badge systems where you have more control over the clients.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Because of the disruption of rolling over a root CA, you want it to be valid for a long time. A quick look through my browser's root certs shows 15 year certs, 20 year certs, and even some 30 year certs.</p>\n"

Typically, wireless networks broadcast their name, and your PC \u201clistens\u201d for the name of the network that it wants to connect to. Because a hidden network doesn\u2019t broadcast, your PC can't find it, so the network has to find your PC. For this to happen, your PC must broadcast both the name of the network it's looking for and its own name. <strong>In this situation, other PCs \u201clistening\u201d for networks will know the name of your PC as well as the network you\u2019re connected to, which increases the risk of your PC being attacked.</strong> <sub>(emphasis added)</sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I had always believed that hidden wireless networks were actually safer than normal ones, because only those who already know of the network are able to connect to it, so an attacker wouldn't be able to connect to it to listen to your traffic.</p>\n\n<p>Are hidden networks actually more risky, as the paragraph says, and if so, what measures can be taken to help mitigate the risk?</p>\n\n<p>Also, I know that there are some countries where publicly broadcasting home networks are actually illegal, and hidden networks are the only option for wireless.  If broadcasting networks are safer, why are they illegal in some places?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

A hidden SSID means that the <em>client</em> machine (not the attacker's machine) will shout at regular intervals \"Hey, Joe, where are you ? Please respond !\". Either way, assuming that the SSID (here, \"Joe\") is not known to any attacker would be overly naive.</p>\n\n<p>A point that could be made is that when the SSID is hidden, then an attacker may assume that the SSID is valuable in some way; so, when your PC connects, your PC shows that it knows the valuable SSID, and thus is also a valuable target in some sense. Not that it would change much things in practice: attackers will attack everything in range anyway, as a matter of principle.</p>\n"

The analysis regarding attacks is primarily done outside of Zeek and the focus for Zeek is on collecting detailed information about the traffic.  Sometimes custom protocol dissectors are added which are specific for the protocols used in the environment.

                "content": " <p>Your question is subject to some subtleties. Fasten your seat belt, I am going to be verbose.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Digital Medium</strong></h2>\n\n<p>You want a \"digital\" medium. What is that <em>exactly</em> ? In a hard disk, a bit is written by changing the orientation of some magnetic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dipoles</a>, created by the \"movement\" (inasmuch as it can be defined as per quantum mechanics) of electrons in some of the atoms of the disk platter. Roughly speaking, each atom has a natural orientation, and the bit is stored by changing this orientation, i.e. \"rotating\" the atom. So there is some amount of \"physical movement\" in it. That's also true with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">flash memory</a>: data is stored by accumulating \"charges\" in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">semiconductor substrate</a>; the charge corresponds to the \"physical\" movement of electrons (they hop between \"bands\" -- the kind-of orbital trajectories of electrons around atom kernels).</p>\n\n<p>Now consider a sheet of some material in which you engrave some data; there again, that's just \"moving around\" some of the atoms of the material, so it is not <em>qualitatively</em> distinct from magnetic storage. You can make a distinction based on the amount of matter which is moved for a single bit, but this involves an arbitrary threshold.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engraving\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Engraving</a> has a remarkable record of long-term reliability for information storage. Consider this marvelous extract from the <a href=\"http://www.schoyencollection.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sch\u00f8yen collection</a>:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9SPwU.jpg\" alt=\"MS 3029 - Gift from the high and mighty of Adab to the high priestess, on the occasion of her election to the temple (Sumer, 26th century BC)\"></p>\n\n<p>This specific data file has been stored for more than 4500 <em>years</em>, in an area which has been scourged by countless wars in between. Empires have waxed and waned, and the soil soaked by the blood of warriors. Yet the information remained and was not lost; and, even better, it was stored at <strong>no marginal cost at all</strong>. As can be seen on the picture above, the medium would be good for a few more millenia at least. Data integrity is more threatened by, let's say, \"encoding problems\" (although that specific example could be translated nonetheless).</p>\n\n<p>From the wording of your question, I assume that you would declare such engraving as \"not digital\" and reject it. Now, have a look at this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FX8PO.jpg\" alt=\"Microscoping view of the surface of a CD\"></p>\n\n<p>This is a close-up view of the surface of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Compact Disc</a>, of the \"pressed\" variety (i.e. not a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-R\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CD-R</a>). The bits are encoding by embossing, the dual operation of engraving; a big press is involved in the process. A CD-R does not use embossing; rather, the optical properties of a dye layer are modified with a laser, so a CD-R is more similar to printing on paper (in particular <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_printer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">thermal printers</a> as are common in payment terminals).</p>\n\n<p>A CD is definitely \"digital\". However, it is not qualitatively distinct from the work of a Sumerian scribe on a stone slab. To declare the latter \"not digital\", you have to enforce a totally arbitrary threshold, which, as such, can be challenged.</p>\n\n<p>You might want to make a distinction based on how the data can be read back into a computer, on the basis that a CD goes into a reader which outputs zeroes and ones on a wire. However, the slab picture above which you saw went to your computer over wires as zeroes and ones, so, there again, the distinction is subject to an arbitrary threshold. As a more striking example, consider <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">QR codes</a> like this one:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bk9q2.png\" alt=\"QR code for Wikipedia (mobile version of the main English page)\"></p>\n\n<p>Now, a QR code printed on a sheet of paper, or engraved on a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">marble slab</a> (to be read with tangential lighting, so as to shadow the pits), is that digital or not ?</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Magnetism and EMP</strong></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magnetism</a> is a property of some materials. Magnetism is convenient for computerized data storage, because of the achievable high density, low latency, and possibility of multiple rewrites. However, this last property is also the bane of long-term storage: stored data can be affected by external magnetic sources, and is subject to gradual leakage. Even reading implies \"grabbing\" a bit of energy from the medium, thus weakening the data storage. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magneto-optical_drive\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magneto-optical drives</a> fare a bit better:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The medium magnetism can be altered only at high temperatures; at room temperature, it is \"fixed\".</li>\n<li>Reading can be done optically (because the medium optical qualities are modified by the magnetic orientation which was forced upon it when it was last heated), thus leaving the magnetic field \"alone\".</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Although manufacturers of magneto-optical drives claim reliable storage for long durations (decades, up to a century or two), this heavily depends on environmental conditions, and has never been tested \"in full size\" since the technology itself is not that old.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, magnetic storage, whether magneto-optical or not, can be disrupted by applying a huge amount of magnetism in one go, something known as an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Electromagnetic Pulse</strong></a>. This is the electromagnetic equivalent of a full stadium of beer-powered sport fans bellowing simultaneously (this has been used by some movie directors to obtain sound effects which are hard to simulate in a lab, resulting for instance in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgcFAsXAGiQ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this scene</a> -- a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">cricket</a> stadium was involved). The method of choice for generating big EMP is through nuclear weapons: nuclear fission and fusion emit huge amounts of high energy gamma rays, which, by colliding with electrons, create the EMP. EMP can also be generated with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosively_pumped_flux_compression_generator\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">non-nuclear devices</a>, albeit with a much lower energy.</p>\n\n<p>Hollywood, in its everlasting educational mission, has depicted a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_wlTsLIPxE\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">non-nuclear EMP</a> in which the generating device looks like a jukebox. There has been some allowance for artistic license, though: a non-nuclear EMP works by rapid compression of a conductor in a magnetic field, where \"rapid\" means \"high explosives\". While the EMP effect has some military applications in specific situations (especially disabling onboard electronics in missiles, without needing to actually hit the missile with another missile), the common wisdom is that the explosives are more a general threat than the EMP itself. Would-be terrorists would not care about electromagnetism; they would just blow up things with the explosives alone.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Faraday cage</a> is effective against EMP proper; however, it does not block gamma rays and neutrons from a nuclear explosion, so gamma rays may enter the cage and generate a local pulse by interacting with the magnetic storage medium itself. The best protection for magnetic storage devices against a nuclear event is a deep underground bunker (it is also efficient for protecting human operators). That's what they do for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NORAD\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">NORAD</a>: the headquarters are buried under a mountain.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Security: Threats and Goals</strong></h2>\n\n<p>There are two sides to data security:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Protection against destruction:</strong> we want to be able to read the data back later on, possibly after many decades. An attacker may want to prevent us from doing that.</li>\n<li><strong>Protection against data theft:</strong> we do <em>not</em> want an attacker to be able to access the data.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These two goals are partially opposite to each other. The best protection against destruction is duplication; if you have a dozen copies of the data scattered over five continents, then the attacker will have a hard time obliterating them all (even <a href=\"http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Horcrux\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Harry Potter</a> could not do it in less than seven books). However, the more physical copies there are, the harder it is to protect them all against illicit copying. To some extent, <em>theft</em> is just another copy, so theft protects against destruction...</p>\n\n<p>The situation is substantially different, depending on when and how you want to be able to access the stored data (data storage makes sense only if you plan to access the data at some point, even conditionally). If you just want long-term storage as a backup in case of a large-scale disaster, then you can use a non-networked storage facility, thereby removing all threats related to \"hacking\". Thus, protection against theft becomes a matter of physical security: store the data in a bunker, enlist guardians with (as @Lucas suggests) fierce dogs.</p>\n\n<p>Guardians and dogs are a worry, though, because:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>There are costs: you must feed them, entertain them, see to their general well-being and health, but in the same time subject them to enough stress and well-dosed misery so that they remain sharp and mean killing machines. And you must do that for the dogs, too.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bribery is a problem. Each biological entity you allow around the premises is yet another target for subversion. Elaborate cross-spying schemes, with rewards on ratting out, can mitigate the issue, but involve even higher costs, and are considered to be \"toxic to the workplace\".</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The storage medium can trigger the same kind of issue. If you use magnetic storage such as hard disks, then you must regularly (say, on a yearly basis) power the drives, and replace the units which fail to go live (invariably, some will fail to power up). This entails some redundancy (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">error correcting codes</a> and variants, such as what is used in some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">RAID arrays</a>) and, you get it, operators. Those pesky humans tend to have external lives, through which they can be controlled by adverse parties (give a man one million dollar, or kidnap his mother, and see if he keeps on refusing something as simple as pinching a hard disk).</p>\n\n<p>If the facility does not need regular intervention, then you can, to some extent, use discretion as a substitute. For instance, consider the external lookout of the tomb of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tutankhamun</a> (actually, a view from the Valley of the Kings, in Egypt, at a place where archeologists of the last two centuries have not yet defaced the landscape with their excavations):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UkY0i.jpg\" alt=\"View from the Valley of the Kings, Egypt\"></p>\n\n<p>and compare that to the tomb of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khufu\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Khufu</a>, of, let's say, questionable inconspicuousness:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ztORz.jpg\" alt=\"The Great Pyramid of Giza\"></p>\n\n<p>Now guess which one was <em>not</em> robbed in more than three thousand years ?</p>\n\n<p>That's \"Security through Obscurity\" and it is known to be unreliable (e.g. see the plot of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_a_Few_Dollars_More\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">For a Few Dollars More</a>), but \"unreliable\" does not mean that it never works...</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Encryption</strong></h2>\n\n<p>It is time to flourish our secret weapon: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">encryption</a>. Encryption does not <em>create</em> secrecy; however, it <em>concentrates</em> secrecy. You have a key; it is a sequence of bits which have been generated with as much randomness as is practical (e.g. with coin flips, or sufficiently unbiased dice). Using the key, you can transform the data, even huge amounts of data, into a big heap of meaningless junk of roughly the same size of the original data; <em>but</em>, knowing the key, you can reverse the operation and recover your precious data.</p>\n\n<p>A cryptographic key for symmetric encryption (\"symmetric\" means that the same key is used for encrypting and for decrypting) needs not be long; it just has to be long enough to thwart exhaustive search (i.e. it would be way too expensive, or even downright impossible with energetic resources available on Earth, to try out any substantial part of the set of possible key values). <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/a/6149/655\">128 bits are enough</a>, but, in order to accommodate inflexible administrative regulations and quiet the qualms of managers who read too many science-fiction books, you might want to pump the key size up to 256 bits\n(don't believe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Fortress\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dan Brown</a>: exhaustive search is <em>not</em> a ultimately workable attack strategy, even if the attack machine is expensive; the scientific basis for this novel is no better than the quality of writing or the plausibility of the characters). As for the encryption algorithm, there is no guarantee that any specific algorithm will keep up its security promises for the next century, but there are good looking candidates which have sustained cryptanalytic advances for more than a decade, and that's not for lack of trying. I am of course speaking about the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">AES</a>, which seems to be quite secure, and, furthermore, is Approved by governmental bodies throughout the World. AES <em>might</em> not ultimately protect your data, but it is the best that can be offered right now, and its security is plausible enough that you can get insurance against possible attacks at reasonable costs.</p>\n\n<p>The secrecy concentration works like this: if the data you store is encrypted, then you no longer have to worry about theft of the data itself. You can store your gigabytes on any number of hard disks, copied and stored over dozens of remote places so that local disasters and \"Acts of God\" do not destroy it. Hundreds of underpaid henchmen may oversee the regular maintenance operations, with no bribery issue. You <em>still</em> need to take steps to guarantee the secrecy of the key, but the key is very small, so that's much easier.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>The Solution</strong></h2>\n\n<p>For long-term storage, I thus recommend the following scheme:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Encrypt the data, with AES and a 128-bit key (or 256-bit key if you need to woo investors).</li>\n<li>Store the encrypted data on hard disks or pressed CD (the former have more capacity, the latter require much less maintenance), and put these in guarded bunkers in geographical locations which are far away from each other (preferably, in distinct countries over several continents).</li>\n<li>Make a few copies of the key by engraving it on stone slabs (marble is classical; avoid limestone, which might lack durability in humid conditions; the Distinguished Customer will want to engrave on diamonds). Put the slabs in the safes of a few banks (do <em>not</em> conceal them in jewelry worn by your mistress -- that's the way of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Say_Never_Again\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">James Bond villains</a> and it does not work well, for long-term secrecy).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For extra security, split the key into parts with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shamir's Secret Sharing</a>, so that plundering one bank does not endanger the secrecy of the key.</p>\n\n<p>The trick, of course, is to make attacks more expensive than what the data is worth. If destroying or stealing your data involves a wide-scale nuclear war or a worldwide <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">meteorite strike</a>, then chances are that <em>your</em> data will be quite irrelevant in such conditions, and nobody will bother resorting to such drastic measures just to get at it.</p>\n"

                "content": " <p>To answer your first question: No, I don't believe you have much to worry about. In particular, they <em>are</em> authenticating themselves, and I think you have some confusion in terminology going on here. The fact that the auth token is in the request body doesn't change anything about authentication. Many API calls work this way (although passing the auth token in the header may be more common). If you contacted them and tried to address the lack of authentication (like you are here) I'm sure they would have dismissed your concerns, because they are in fact authenticating themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding your concerns over DDOS, the difference between getting an auth token out of a header (which is probably the only other place it can live) and parsing it out of a JSON body is very minimal from the perspective of CPU usage. I don't expect it to make any practical difference in helping an attacker succeed in a DDOS attack. In all likelihood you have much more CPU intensive pages than this anyway, so if someone were to perform a targeted attack against your system and take the time to try to find the weakest endpoint, there are probably many much more tempting pages to be found.</p>\n\n<p>However, even that isn't a real concern. Most DDOS attacks these days work by simply throwing as many requests at the target as possible to saturate their network bandwidth.  As a result, the actual endpoint doesn't even matter, and the requests the attackers send are very rarely valid requests anyway. I doubt many attackers would bother doing more than looking up the IP address of your server(s), and there are probably very few circumstances in which they would first spend time looking around your website trying to find the most vulnerable page.</p>\n\n<p>If you are concerned about DDOS get a DDOS mitigation partner like cloud flare. As Josef mentions, you can also try IP address limits on the page. However, there are much more effective ways to spend your time to protect your site against DDOS then trying to change the API structure of a third party service when your application has plenty more endpoints for an attacker to hit anyway.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Clarifications</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the security world no answers are especially helpful without good threat modeling.  As a result, it's worth breaking down the \"threat model\" you are concerned about.  Having a request that passes the auth token in the body is important <strong>if</strong>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Someone is targeting your system for DDOS attack</li>\n<li>They don't have enough bandwidth at their disposal to simply overrun your network resources (<a href=\"https://www.incapsula.com/blog/new-ddos-attack-method-demands-a-fresh-approach-to-amplification-assault-mitigation.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DDOS of network resources via amplifications attacks alone accounts for ~half of all DDOS attacks</a>)</li>\n<li>They therefore decide to target particular endpoints in your system that are resource-intensive</li>\n<li>They happen to stumble upon this unpublished endpoint and are able to figure out how the API call works</li>\n<li>They don't find another endpoint in your system that is more resource intensive</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If all of those conditions are met, then indeed, someone might use this endpoint to DDOS your system, and the difference between authentication in the header and in the body may in fact matter.  However, in case it isn't clear, <strong>these conditions are never going to be met</strong>.  If someone wants to DDOS your systems they will probably just go off and <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3180246/data-protection/hire-a-ddos-service-to-take-down-your-enemies.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rent a DDOS</a> that will flood your systems with meaningless network traffic.  It is both easier and more effective then trying to identify an actual weak point in your system.  This is the primary reason why this doesn't matter from the perspective of a DDOS: the DDOS attack you are worried about is never going to happen because there are easier and faster ways to DDOS a website than this.  The only way to protect against realistic kinds of DDOS attacks is with a DDOS mitigation provider.</p>\n\n<p>This is why threat modeling and understanding real world threats is so important.  You can spend weeks working with a third party provider to change their API in a way that minimizes CPU time on your end, only to then have your systems knocked out by a DDOS that blindly sends invalid requests into your network and overwhelms your network capacity.  If you spend your time protecting against the wrong kinds of threats, you can end up wasting a lot of time and (more importantly) implementing the wrong kinds of safe guards.</p>\n"

I have the workflow bound to OnCreate and OnChange.  I publish the workflow and everything works properly.</p>\n\n<p>The Problem:\nEvery few months the workflow suddenly stops generating the print link.  When I investigate I can see that the workflow isn't trying to run (i.e. It doesn't say \"Cancelled\" or \"Failed\" or \"Complete\" in the Workflow execution column of the list ... the column is just blank.  Similarly the workflow history list doesn't get any entries when I add items to the list either.)  So I open up Designer and check the workflow and it says it is still bound to Create and Change.  However, the only way to fix the workflow is to publish it again.</p>\n\n<p>The Question: I'm at my wits end to try and troubleshoot this problem.  Has anybody encountered anything similar?

It's simple enough to create a variable for the path to insert into the filter, but when it comes to the username, passing a variable in its place does not seem to work using any method I have tried. CAML (or at least the pseudo-CAML used in filters) likes the user's name to actually be the name <strong>field</strong> (in this case, pulled from AD) not the <strong>account</strong> name. So after a little playing around I figured out how to turn that into a variable to pass into the filter like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>string userName = vUser.Name;\nstring oFilter = (\"&lt;Query&gt;&lt;And&gt;&lt;Or&gt;&lt;Eq&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='ItemFullUrl'/&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + fullPath + \"&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Eq&gt;&lt;BeginsWith&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='ItemFullUrl'/&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + fullPath + \"/&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/BeginsWith&gt;&lt;/Or&gt;&lt;Neq&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + userName + \"&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='Editor/New'/&gt;&lt;/Neq&gt;&lt;/And&gt;&lt;/Query&gt;)\");\noAlert.Filter = oFilter;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The user.Name property outputs a name that matches the format in the CAML filter of a working alert I examined. If I type the name directly into the filter it works fine, but when I try to pass it as a variable it breaks, even if I explicitly set the variable to \"User Name\".</p>\n\n<p>Is there some part of how the filter/string works that I'm not accounting for? Every search I've done online has said this method should work, in theory. My goal is simply to make the alert apply only to changes made by other users, is there perhaps another way to accomplish that?</p>\n\n<p>Any advice is greatly appreciated!</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

The project I'm working on (with 6 other persons) is a complex Java-based application that's being developed for over 5 years. The entire time we were using SVN, without branching. Now, I would like to switch to Git as I do believe Git will provide superior branching and ease some development.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, before I do switch, I have to tell you about the current workflow we're having with SVN, I have to hear opinion from people experienced with Git and to tell you what are the things I expect from Git. <em>Please</em> tell me if Git can provide the things I need the way I need them, because if I switch the entire project to Git and then it turns out I have to revert it to SVN (for any reason), I would be dead :) .</p>\n\n<p>The principle we're following with SVN is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Each team member is working on a single feature. When such feature is done, a local copy of dev's code is updated against SVN master and feature is deployed for testing. If testing by clients passed, the person developing the code pushes it to our main (and only) branch with a proper commit message that explains the feature, ticket number and so on.</p></li>\n<li><p>If, during \"update before deploying for testing\" the team member gets into conflicts, he's cherry-picking conflicting files line by line.</p></li>\n<li>When time comes that we deploy new features to production, I load the production code from a particular folder on the disk (like \"physical branch\"), I sync that code to the current state of the SVN, going class by class, reviewing committed changed and taking the code meant for that particular deploy. Usually, it happens that out of 230 classes we have in the repo (and not in production workspace) bewteen 30 and 50 classes are with conflicts because of the features we don't need on production yet. Sometimes, clients ask for the latest features <strong>before</strong> wanting some older features. If both feature they want and features they don't affect the same file, I have to manually skip some particular file from commit version number 3 to commit version number 6 <strong>without</strong> taking any changes from commits 4 or 5. Now, if another file is also affected, it happens that another file from version, say, 35, I have to update to version 40 without taking any changes done between 35 and 40.\nWith SVN, it's easy, I sync a particular file and pick only the lines of codes ignoring all others. It takes time but I am in a position to tell clients \"we'll postpone this for X days\".</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also, if two developers are working on different features that largely affect the same subsystem or big number of the same files, in order to avoid nasty conflicts and collisions I usually tell clients \"we can't develop both things in the same time, we'll postpone feature B till feature A is done and tested\" and one of the devs get to work on something else.</p>\n\n<p>Now, from Git the only thing I basically need is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Nice Windows GUI (for SVN we're using \"Subclipse\" plugin for Eclipse). I'm really not into investing a lot of time just learning or remembering how to push a branch or view the history or do something similar if it can be done with the click of a button. For me, the version control system should be just a tool - not something my devs should spend more than a day learning how to use because of CLI and advanced things we'll never use or require. With SVN we use only 4 commands: commit, update, synchronize (to see the differences) and \"history\". Ok, sometimes we do use \"compare with version X from repo\" but not so often.</li>\n<li>The ability to achieve nice code storage by using only a few basic commands (button clicks to be precise :D ): push / pull, fetch / commit, branch / merge, view history. Nothing fancy or advanced which would take a lot of time to learn or understand.</li>\n<li>The ability to partially take commits. For example: commit consists of 10 files. I take all changes from 8 files, but for two files I do cherry-pick in a manner that from current production version 5 I take two lines of code from file commit version 7 and few lines from file commit version 9 (effectively keeping those two files in \"undefined version\" so that I can supply my clients with the newest changes without all code changes preceding that newest feature I want). To achieve this point, for me it's not a problem to allocate an entire day digging through history and commits regardless if it's SVN or Git. That's my \"preparing deploy\" day anyway :)</li>\n<li>Having numerical commit versions, not HASH-based ones!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is it possible with Git? I really have limited experience with Git, only on some small projects and I can't afford to move the entire code base from one system to another :( Please give me some advice.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

You probably need first and foremost a better workflow, utilizing branches, and <strong>not necessarily another tool</strong>. Why not start using feature branches <strong>with SVN</strong>? If you are going to develop two major features in parallel, just create individual branches for the features and assign them as a temporary \"work space\" for the part of the team which is going to implement the features.</p>\n\n<p>That is a fairly simple and easy to grasp branching model, SVN supports this well, and as long as the centralized repo model of SVN is not a problem for your team, it might be all you need. You \"newbie\" developer will still just use \"commit, update, synchronize, history\" on the branch you assigned to him (and a daily \"merge from trunk into my feature branch\"), only the person who will integrate the features back into the trunk some day will have to know some more SVN commands. This integration step will become much easier than you current \"cherry picking\" approach, since you do not have to sort out which code change belongs to a certain feature afterwards in the cumbersome and error-prone manner you described.</p>\n\n<p>When you go this route and reach the point where you and your team want to do more complex branches, and you notice SVN is not be sufficient any more, for example, when you need a tool for doing distributed, local branches, then it is time to switch to Git.

                "content": " <p>What do you do if the consumer that was handling an order crashed?</p>\n\n<p>You do not want to have a consumer receive items on an order and process them. You want an intermediary that builds partial orders with the items that are being pushed.</p>\n\n<p>So, on one side you have a producer that begins an order, add items to the order and finishes the order. In the middle you have the intermediary that aggregates the items into partial order objects. In the other side you have the consumer of orders.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Deciding what design to implement:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pull vs Push</li>\n<li>Synchronous vs. Asynchronous.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Pull vs Push</h2>\n\n<p>Push based design requires a simpler threading model (I go back to this), it is harder to get it wrong.</p>\n\n<p>The Push based design will just be doing a method call to notify consumers. Which means it will be aware if they fail (e.g. thrown exception). And this makes it easy to have it push the value to a different consumer if a consumer crashed.</p>\n\n<p><em>If we do that at the level of items being pushed into the order, then it will be very hard to go to a different consumer. It would require to keep track of partially completed orders. The intermediary solves this problem. Once we have the intermediary it makes much more sense to aggregate an order and process it as a single value.</em></p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if the consumer fails on a Pull based design, there is no easy way for the producer to know. Which means that having the producer give the same value to a different consumer is hardly viable.</p>\n\n<p>Distributing the Pull based design would result in clients pooling the server, which is not good. However, the Push based design is much easier to distribute... for example, the method would do an asynchronous call across the network (which could be sockets, RPC, web design, message queues, etc...).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if the consumer needs to pull, it is easy to have the Push based design add to a queue, per consumer, from where it can pull (although that loses some of the benefits). On the other hand, if the consumer wants notifications being pushed, with the Pull based design, now you need to have a thread pulling and pushing, per consumer, which is more expensive.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I strongly believe a Push based design is the superior option. However, if I understand correctly, you are currently using a database. The way databases work is that you Pull, I mean, query. Thus, I assume you have a Pull based design. Changing to a Push based design will have a cost in refactoring your code.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Synchronous vs. Asynchronous</h2>\n\n<p>The intermediary step must be Synchronous. Having it asynchronous is just making it harder to get right and maintain.</p>\n\n<p>The producer side can be Asynchronous. However, this does not have to exposed in the design, since it will likely be fire and forget.</p>\n\n<p>The consumer side, since I am encouraging a Push based design, it will be Synchronous.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, as far as the API goes, it will be Synchronous.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Implementation considerations</h2>\n\n<p>You will have multiple queues, either way. If we assume no intermediaries, you need: One queue of items per order, one queue of orders that are yet to be assigned to a consumer (If you are pulling, you pick the order from here. If you are pushing, new subscribers can take from here), and \u2013 depending on the design \u2013 a queue or set of available consumers. The intermediaries would replace the queues of items per order.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Since the Push based design needs to find a subscription to notify, it might use a set of consumers that are available.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The Pull based design will need wait handles to have the consumer threads wait until new values are made available (this is why I say the Push based design has a simpler threading model). Also consider tear-down. We need to make sure those thread are not stuck waiting.</p>\n\n<p>On the Push based design, consumers are not tied to a thread. Instead, we use subscriptions to keep track of them. A subscription must be a reference to (or an object with an interface that has a) method to call to pass a value.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It is a good idea to break these solution into components. In particular, the Pull based design, effectively has blocking queues (queue plus wait handle), and the Push based design, effectively has one way channels (subscription plus queue). Those are things you might get from libraries, and using them will simply the implementation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: on the Push based design, if there are no subscription to push to, the values got to be queued.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>You still need to be extra careful about race conditions. In particular, the Push based design has two notable race conditions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A new subscription when there are no unassigned happening while a value is being pushed could result in the value being queued and the subscription not being assigned.</li>\n<li>(in some designs) A new subscription, finished going over the queued values and removes the queue, while a new value is being pushed into the queue could result in the value being lost.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are a few useful locking solutions for these. In particular, I want to mention that you can queue operations. That is, add the operation (it can be a callback) to do to a thread safe queue. Try to get the lock. The thread got the lock executes all the operations in the queue. If the thread did not get the lock, it mans another thread got it... and that other thread will do the operation. Thus it can move on without waiting. This way no thread will be waiting on the lock. <em>Use only on identified race condition. If you do this for everything, it would be very easy to have a thread stuck inside the loop indeterminately.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: the Pull based design gets around its race conditions by retying. It is try-wait-loop.</p>\n"

All I see here is entities with properties, and the problem can easily be redefined to exclude the property which must be identical, and to only consider the subset of entities that do in fact have the same value on that excluded property.</p>\n\n<p>So, basically, what you have is a set of entities where each entity has a list of N properties, and you have a separate entity which we will call the \"reference\" entity, and you want to search through that set to find entities that have as dissimilar as possible values from the reference entity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Essentially, you want a maximum distance in N-dimensional space algorithm.</strong></p>\n\n<p>First of all you need to compute the N-dimensional vector of the values of your reference entity.  This is essentially the coordinates of a point in N-dimensional space. (If you want, you can imagine that N = 3, so you can be thinking of the problem in 3-dimensional space.)</p>\n\n<p>Then, you need to loop through the rest of your entities, and for each entity you need to calculate its N-dimensional vector, (imagine another point in 3-dimensional space,) then you need to calculate the distance between the reference vector and this vector, which is going to be another N-vector, and then you need to take the <em>absolute value</em>, a.k.a. <em>magnitude</em> of that vector, which will be a single value, and store it.</p>\n\n<p>Once all the magnitudes have been collected, you need to sort all your entities by this magnitude value, and your desired results will be gathered near the end of the list, where the largest magnitudes will be.</p>\n\n<p>This is the standard way of solving the bulk of your problem, and I would strongly advise solving it precisely like that, so as to be implementing an algorithm which will be understandable by others, and also by yourself, should you revisit it a few months later.</p>\n\n<p>Now, your particular situation has certain peculiarities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The values of your properties are not nice real numbers, they are sets of discrete values. So, you will need to map them to real numbers.  A range from 0 to 1 will work just fine, as Sirisian suggested. You can probably combine your discrete color and your discrete brightness together into three property values, whether they be HSV, HSL, or perhaps even RGB, I don't think it will matter much.</p></li>\n<li><p>You want a variable number of results, and you want some randomness.  So, select a percentage of entities at the end of the sorted list, and choose a specific number from them, at random.</p></li>\n</ul>\n"

Based on those observations, they designed operator precedence in Fortress. This is the only instance I know of where a Programming Language Designer has explicitly written down their rationale for Operator Precedence.</p>\n\n<p>Operator Precedence in Fortress works a little bit different from other languages. The main difference is that there is no globally defined precedence across all operators. Instead, operators have <em>relative</em> precedence to other operators: <code>*</code> is-higher-than <code>+</code>, for example. Using two operators in the same expression without explicit parentheses that do not have a defined operator precedence, is a Syntax Error. In other words: the precedence relation is not a total ordering, it is in fact not even a partial ordering, it isn't an ordering at all because the relationship is not transitive: even if operator <strong>X</strong> is defined to be tighter than <strong>Y</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> is defined to be tighter than <strong>Z</strong>, that does not mean that <strong>X</strong> is tighter than <strong>Z</strong> and you are not allowed to mix <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Z</strong> in the same expression without parentheses because they do not have a defined relative precedence.</p>\n\n<p>This neatly side-steps questions such as \"should the string concatenation operator have higher or lower precedence than bitwise-XOR?\" Well, neither. It doesn't make sense to mix the two in the same expression, so they don't have a defined relative precedence. And if you <em>do</em> mix the two, then you need to use parentheses.</p>\n\n<p>In general, operators in Fortress only have a defined relative precedence, if they are commonly used together in the same expression in scientific papers and there is a general consensus in the scientific community what the precedence should be.</p>\n\n<p>There is also another nice feature: the programmer can use whitespace to indicate what he thinks the precedence should be (but not override precedence). So, you can write <code>a\u00d7b+c</code>, you can write <code>a \u00d7 b + c</code>, you can write <code>a\u00d7b + c</code>, but you cannot write <code>a \u00d7 b+c</code>, the latter is again a Syntax Error. (And yes, Fortress uses the times symbol for multiplication, not the asterisk. It also uses \u2227 and \u2228 for logical-conjunction and logical-disjunction, \u222a and \u2229 for union and intersection, it uses actual subscripting for array subscripting and uses superscript for exponentiation.)</p>\n\n<p>A third nice feature is that Fortress has a juxtaposition operator, i.e. an operator for writing two expressions next to each other. For example, for numbers, juxtaposition is defined as multiplication, i.e. in the example above, I could have written <code>a b + c</code> instead of <code>a \u00d7 b + c</code>. For unary functions, juxtaposition is application, so <code>f(x)</code> and <code>f x</code> are equivalent.</p>\n"

Briefly, this application allows the user to create contracts for subscribers with two constraints:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You cannot create more than one contract for a subscriber.</li>\n<li>Once a contract is created, it cannot be deleted (from the UI).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let's say TestCreate is a test case with tests for the normal creation of a contract.</p>\n\n<p>The constraints have introduced complexities to the testing process, mainly dependencies between test cases and test executions.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Before we run TestCreate we need to make sure that the application is in a suitable state (the subscriber has no contract)</li>\n<li>If we run TestCreate twice, the second run will fail since the state of the application will have changed.</li>\n<li>So we need to revert back to the initial state (i.e. delete the contract), which is impossible to do from the UI.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>More generally, after each test case we should guarantee that the state is reverted back. And since, in this case, it is impossible to do it from the UI, how do you handle this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Possible solution</strong>: I thought about doing a backup of the database in the state that I desire, and after each test case, run a script which deletes the db and restores the backup. However, I find that to be too heavy to do for each single test case. In addition, what if some information are stored in files? or in multiple or unaccessible databases? </p>\n\n<p><strong>My question:</strong> In this situation, what would an experienced tester do to write automated and maintanable tests. Thank you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>More info</strong>: I'm trying to integrate tests into a BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) framework, which I find to be a neat solution for test documentation and communication, but it does not solve this particular problem (it even makes it harder)</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

Internally too, there was a conflict. The BA's agreed that the internal branding was not needed and we can go with the default Microsoft(!) blue. But no, the final stakeholder kept insisting on retaining the green color or we do NOT do the upgrade at all. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What did we developers do?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Held a meeting with final stakeholder.

I cannot tell how much I am\n  upset that we are about to lose the\n  internal branding which you have built\n  and stood for in so many years.

I was thinking about the code during my commutes to home, before going to sleep and even as I was alone in the room with my girlfriend.</p>\n<p>That's when I knew I had to stop.<br />\nI have pretty much figured it out now, and here's my advice to you.</p>\n<h2>Get Positive</h2>\n<p>First, accept that you can't just <em>stop</em> thinking about the work out of the blue. This is a <em>habit</em> you have acquired, and habits don't disappear at your immediate will.</p>\n<p>However you can start by <strong>reshaping your experience into a positive one</strong>.<br />\nConsider this example of negative thinking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don't know which database design is better. The deadline is coming next week and I feel I can't make the right decision at the moment. We can't afford to hesitate and If I fail now, I will be the one to blame.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This leads you nowhere.</p>\n<p>It may sound trivial but if you suspect you don't work well enough, or worse, procrastinate, your conscience will revenge on you. <strong>It's five times as hard to think about work when you feel like you fail at it</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you're in this kind of situation, there is something you can do about it <em>right now</em>.<br />\nEssentially, there are two points to add to your workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you have something <strong>to be proud of</strong> every evening.</li>\n<li>Make sure you have something <strong>you <em>strive</em> to work on</strong> every morning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ultimate goal of this is to <strong>switch your obsession to a positive tone</strong>. You know the feeling when you go to sleep thinking about <em>that awesome code you wrote in just about three hours that solved all the world's problems and made the bunnies happy</em>? You're still obsessed but now you've made a major and very important shift.</p>\n<h2>Get Productive</h2>\n<p>Once you're in the positive stream, you'll find it easier to effectively constrain your tasks to the working hours. Try to plan them in such way that <strong>thinking about the problems in your free time doesn't add any value</strong>. Consider this example of positive thinking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This database design problem is an interesting challenge and I'll try my best to solve it. I know I'm usually more productive in the afternoon so I'll just have some tea now and fix a couple of bugs so I can give it my full attention when I'm at my best. Before leaving, I'll evaluate my results, and if I don't make a considerable progress, next morning I will ask for some advice from the more experienced colleagues and post a question on StackOverflow as well. I'll make the final decision by tomorrow evening.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What has changed? Now you pick your challenges and organize your working time in a way that makes sense <em>to you</em>. These eight hours are not just eight hours in your life, they are <em>special</em>, and you need to take advantage of them. Specifically, you need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn these eight hours into <strong>the Perfect Time\u2122  for problem solving</strong>.</li>\n<li>Make sure that <em>physically</em> being in the office <strong>empowers you</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second point is a kind of trick you can play on yourself. Ask your company to provide you with the best hardware. Do you have <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/04/three-monitors-for-every-user.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">three monitors</a> yet? I keep my favorite teacup at work, and I just <em>love</em> my armchair. I'd never want to solve a problem without it again. Okay, I made up the armchair thingie but the point is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you learn how to get <em>really</em> productive at the office, you will see that <strong>the habit of bringing work home eventually fades because nothing really <em>justifies</em> it anymore</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Get a Life!</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a <strong>great answer by pydave</strong> that does a better job of suggesting after-job activities.<br />\nYou must <a href=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/98986/how-do-you-stop-yourself-from-bringing-work-home/99134#99134\">check it out</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, seriously.<br />\nThinking about a database late night? How about going to a club instead? Watching a movie?<br />\nIf you're not the type of person to know how to spend time, ask your friends to take you out.</p>\n<p>I can't possibly remember how many times I was initially resistant to my friends calling me somewhere and then realized what a great time it had been and how I could've easily missed it out of the passivity. Now, even when work-related thoughts are buzzing in my head, if somebody calls me in my spare time, I just say \u201cI'm in!\u201d and get going.</p>\n<p>A great relief comes when you realize <strong>you're still going to do what you love the next morning and there isn't a single reason to think about it right now</strong>. So go ahead and find something else to muse on!</p>\n<p>Even when you're in love, after some time, you stop thinking about your significant other every single hour. This would have exhausted you. Instead, you split your free hours so there is a time for her (or him), there is a time for your friends and there is a time for you to be alone. There is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't apply the same principle to work.</p>\n<p><strong>Divide and conquer!</strong></p>\n"

C compilers are relatively mature, and C programs require minimal run-time support.  A C program will normally be compiled to something that can be loaded and executed, with just a little preparation on the part of the computer.  (There have been C interpreters, and they were slow like you'd expect.)</p>\n\n<p>Fortran is not usually in those computations, but is similar in most respects.  Fortran was inherently faster in large-scale floating-point computations than the C of the original Standard, since the Fortran compiler could assume, say, that the three matrices passed to a multiplication program were disjoint, and could optimize on that basis.  C compilers couldn't assume that.</p>\n\n<p>Java programs are normally compiled to an artificial machine language, and that is normally compiled on the fly (just-in-time compiling).  That could theoretically be faster than C-style compilation (it could make better guesses about the flow of execution, and it could tailor the compilation to the exact system in use), but in practice isn't.  Java also requires more run-time support, such as a garbage collector, and the JIT compiler and runtime have to load and get going.  That results in increased startup time, which can be noticeable.</p>\n\n<p>Python programs are normally compiled to an artificial machine language and then interpreted, which is slower.  It is possible to store the compiled files (\".pyc\"), but frequently only the source is stored, so to execute it is necessary to compile first and then interpret, which is slow.  Also, Python has dynamic typing, which means the compiler doesn't know everything's type up front, and therefore Python functions have to be able to take different data types at runtime, which is inefficient.</p>\n\n<p>There's always room for surprises.  On one celebrated occasion, a CMU Common Lisp program out-number-crunched a Fortran program.  Common Lisp requires garbage collection, which apparently wasn't an issue in that application, and normally is dynamically typed, but it's possible to declare all types statically.  The Fortran compiler had a small inefficiency the CMU Common Lisp compiler didn't, and was duly improved afterwards.</p>\n"

Yes, I do judge SQL servers by their user interface.  <strong>Everything has a user interface.</strong>  Well, almost everything anyway.  Shells, config files, commands, log files, they all are an interface for users.  Even most linux kernel modules have some UI exposed as files in /sys and /proc.  Yes, those are user interfaces.  Just because it isn't <em>graphical</em> doesn't make it any less important.</p>\n\n<p>Example: I know Postgres is an excellent database.  I'm sad sometimes I don't use it more. I use MySQL more.  Why?  Part of it is that the shell commands are easier to use.  <code>show databases;</code> says what it does and does what it says. I looked that up once, the first time. Never did again. When I use psql, I can rarely remember. Is it <code>\\dl</code> or just <code>\\l</code>? No wait, isn't <code>\\dl</code> something else? Huh, do I really want <code>\\dn</code>? Shoot, ok, what's the command for help? <code>\\help</code>? No, that's a list of SQL commands.  Where is the list of shell commands? Ah. <code>\\?</code> has the list. WHY is <code>\\?</code> different from <code>\\help</code>?</p>\n\n<p>Yeah if I used it all the time I'd get used to it. That's not the point. The point is that well designed software shouldn't require \"getting used to.\"</p>\n\n<p>I know that seems like a silly example but it does have an effect.</p>\n"

They may therefore need to know (or find out) how to work with other microservices, and perhaps even to rely on them.</li>\n<li><em><strong>Loosely coupled</strong></em> means that each microservice is well encapsulated and can be replaced by another microservice offering the same &quot;contract&quot;, the same external interface.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The goal of this architecture is allow you to compose many simpler microservices in order to offer complex services that can be scaled. Achieving this goal does not mean that microservices are independent, but that they are that are <em><strong>independently deployable</strong></em>. And that's a big difference</p>\n<h2>Your question in theory</h2>\n<p>If a microservice A depends on a microservice B you must be able to deploy a new version of A without touching B. So the services are dependent but they can be independently deployed.  As a real-life example, look at the relation between authorisation and product microservices <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tharanganilupul/microservices-implementation-netflix-stack-ba4f4a57a79f\" rel=\"noreferrer\">in the Netflix stack</a>.</p>\n<p>If there is a cycle however, one should analyse if the service decomposition did went to far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If microservice A depends on B, but at the same time B depends on A,  it starts to look very much like a strong coupling. This means that something did not work as it should.  Verify if both functionality should not be packaged as a single microservice.</li>\n<li>If a microservice A depends on a microservice B, which depends on microservice C which depends on microservice A, it's less obvious, but the service decomposition should be challenged for the same reason.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that the dependency can very well be indirect (e.g. via a message queue)</p>\n<h2>Your question in practice</h2>\n<p>Let's look at the rule: &quot;<em>forbid our users buying more than 10 bananas total</em>&quot;:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the rule is a condition for accepting the order, so it needs to be checked as part of <code>Order Service</code></li>\n<li>to verify the rule, you need to find all past orders of the customer (in a given time frame?) and aggregate the quantity by product.  This would therefore typically be implemented as part of <code>Order Service</code></li>\n<li>so for your question, there is no need for questions: everything would be performed as part of one microservice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But you could imagine less trivial scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Order Service</code> could need to look for stock availability to inform the user of out-of-stock items during the ordering process.  Either you'd make sure that all stock events are forwarded to order service.  Or you would make <code>Order Service</code> addressing a request to <code>Stock Service</code>.</li>\n<li>In B2B, it would not be uncommon that <code>Order Service</code> needs to do a credit check for accepting an order, since the customer would pay after having received the goods.  <code>Credit management</code> usually combines information from lot of sources  (e.g. external credit rating agencies, outstanding orders, outstanding invoices, payment history, etc...).  It would be a good candidate for a microservice.  But credit management requires to get invoices from accounting, which might receive them from order management.   So a circular dependency is something that can happen.</li>\n</ul>\n"

Compare this with your solution, which cycles through all of the numbers from 1 to <code>foldl lcm [1..20]</code>. If you try with 30, the difference between the runtimes will be even greater.</p>\n\n<p>Take a look at complexities: your algorithm has <code>O(ans*N)</code> runtime, where <code>ans</code> is the answer and <code>N</code> is the number up to which you are checking for divisibility (20 in your case).<br>\nThe other algorithm executes <code>N</code> times <code>lcm</code>, however <code>lcm(a,b) = a*b/gcd(a,b)</code>, and GCD has complexity <code>O(log(max(a,b)))</code>.

I've already declared that a is an A.  If I want to know the compile-time type of a, I only have to look in one place, at the declaration.  While I acknowledge that the implementation is relatively simple (use the code substitution you describe in your question), this also argues in favor of not implementing the feature; it's easy for coders to do it, too.</p>\n<p>The truly horrifying thing is that the type of a variable can magically change immediately after a <code>}</code>.  C# very deliberately prevents this from happening (see <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/ericlippert/simple-names-are-not-so-simple\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Simple names are not so simple</a>).  So, I absolutely hate any version of this feature that fails to introduce a new variable during the cast.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself constantly casting your types so as to access members of derived classes, it makes me suspect you are misusing inheritance.  Personally, usually in code where I'm using such a conditional, I'm going to break out of my function if the cast fails.  So, my code would look more like this:</p>\n<pre><code>B myB = myA as B;\nif (myB == null) return;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which would, under some variant of your proposal, become this:</p>\n<pre><code>if (!(myA is B)) return;\n</code></pre>\n<p>or (introducing a new name)</p>\n<pre><code>if (!(myA to B myB)) return;\n</code></pre>\n<p>or, using <a href=\"https://roslyn.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Language%20Feature%20Status&amp;referringTitle=Documentation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">declarative expressions</a> (this is a variant on <a href=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/236335/15162\">Jimmy Hoffa's answer</a>)</p>\n<pre><code>if (!a.To(out B myB)) return;\n</code></pre>\n<p>With the exception of the approach using declarative expressions, all of these features require learning new C# syntax for a feature that is not at all painful to deal with.  The declarative expression approach is nice in that it is the <a href=\"https://ericlippert.com/2012/07/17/should-c-warn-on-null-dereference/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">general case of a specific feature</a>; i.e. allowing coders to make use of an assignment and conditional using a single expression.</p>\n<p>The only cost to the declarative expression approach is that it won't work universally; it only works if your special <code>To</code> method is implemented and visible in your current scope.  However, that's a price I'm willing to pay to avoid adding yet more syntax to the C# language; I won't bother using such an extension method unless I'm dealing with code which constantly requires it (and probably not even then).</p>\n<p>In summary: This feature isn't needed quite often enough to justify adding new syntax to the language.  However, the more general feature, declarative expressions, may be worth the cost (which is why Microsoft is probably going to pay it).  It not only handles this case, but also handles the annoying two-statement <code>TryParse</code> case (and, like your proposal, makes for clean scope; the type is only in scope on the inside of the conditional).</p>\n<p><strong>Update: <a href=\"https://roslyn.codeplex.com/discussions/568820\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Declarative Expressions were cancelled</a>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Update 2: <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/whats-new-in-csharp-7-0/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">C# 7.0 is adding &quot;out variables&quot;</a>.</strong> This might be enough for my final example (<code>if (!a.To(out B myB)) return;</code>).  <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/whats-new-in-csharp-7-0/#user-content-is-expressions-with-patterns\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">C# 7.0 is also adding &quot;Is-expressions with patterns&quot;</a>, which allows, <code>if (!(o is int i)) return;</code>.  This is basically the feature you asked for.</p>\n"

Bob also was my long distance relationship boyfriend.</p>\n\n<p>Bob's contribution since the beginning of the venture has been up-and-down. There were a few weeks in which he would record as per the schedule we agreed upon, and then stop after a minor setback (ie. our videos did not receive views/comments). I would ask him from time to time to return to schedule, but he asked me to stop doing so. He did, however, buy a ~$30 microphone to record, of his own volition. He never stated that he no longer wanted to be business partners. I take responsibility for being too lax in negotiating.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I kept to the video production schedule, and I have updated (and continue to update) the social media accounts everyday.</p>\n\n<p>A few months ago Bob and I broke up amicably, but did not discuss what to do with the business. I continued updating the social media accounts during that time. After about a month or so to let the steam cool, I called Bob up to say that I was still interested in running the business and if he was interested in continuing our SOLELY business partnership. He indicated that he was interested in recording again.</p>\n\n<p>The next day I found out that Bob had blocked my personal lines of contact to him.</p>\n\n<p>I have not tried contacting him since then, but I have continued to update the social media accounts. I am no longer interested in doing so, and would like to know if it would be necessary to inform Bob, who is still in a Partnership Agreement with me, that I will no longer be performing my responsibilities as outlined in the agreement. He has not blocked the business's e-mail or social media accounts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> OP here. To clarify further, as this looks to be a point of confusion, Bob has not performed his responsibilities to the business since several weeks before we broke up.

Effectively, if you participate on work-related (in my case, core Stack Overflow, Programmers and Workplace) and also non work-related (in my case, Genealogy &amp; Family History and the Arqade) sites, that's the equivalent of, say, having a technical blog and also a personal blog. Do you link the two together? Up to you.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I don't think there's any reason to stress too much about mixing work-related and non work-related things on the one Stack profile. Instead, I'd look at it from the angle of whether or not you want any given question or answer to be linked to your main profile. For instance, we often see people creating new anonymous accounts to ask questions here on the Workplace because they don't want their questions about their workplace connected to their known profile. It's probably easier to do it case-by-case and use a fresh profile to ask a question if and when you need to.</p>\n"

The key things that employers look for in problem-solving skills are:</p>\n\n<p>1) Ability to identify a problem.

Take this as an opportunity to impress your new employers. People with a reputation for finishing work ahead of time are valuable - and in software, very rare. Let your manager know that you're free and ready to be assigned your next task.</p>\n\n<p>Alternately you may want to see if you can set up a system where you can \"pull\" work, rather than have your manager \"push\" it to you. To start with you can make sure that your manager keeps your to-do list sufficiently long that you never run out, but eventually you might want to influence the working procedures of your workplace towards a more agile approach (where your <em>team</em> has a to-do list, and you grab the item at the top when you're free).</p>\n\n<h2>Find ways to generate value yourself</h2>\n\n<p>If you think your manager will just give you make-work to get you out of their hair, or if you don't like the sound of asking for more, then why don't you look for some ways you can generate value for the company yourself? See if you can automate a build or a deployment. Introduce a tool to automatically enforce a policy usually checked by hand. There are usually thousands of things that could get done that we never get around to.</p>\n\n<p>Use your judgement, though. You're likely to want to clear this kind of thing with your manager anyway.</p>\n\n<h2>Improve your skills</h2>\n\n<p>Read a book, explore an API, dig into the source control logs of an open-source component your project uses.</p>\n\n<p>Learn about the domain you're working in. Are there any useful documents on your intranet? Regulations that it would be useful for you to understand?</p>\n\n<p>Good employers will appreciate your initiative, though you may wish to exercise caution before indulging yourself excessively.</p>\n"

We were a small team of 3 people managing and developing the tools for our companies (we are the HQ). Almost 5 months ago, one of our colleagues left and since then I am having an increased number of tasks. Over these 2 years I have learned a lot and now I'm faster and more efficient at completing tasks and am able to tackle more complex matters too.</p>\n\n<h2>Salary history</h2>\n\n<p>This job was advertised as \"the minimum salary for this job is xx$\". And since before this job I've done a one year internship and it was the first \"real\" job plus the fact that it was matching perfectly with what I've done for one year and it also was what I wanted to continue with, I didn't try to negotiate this minimum offered salary out of fear of not getting the job. Fast forward 1 year later, I was waiting for the first employee appraisal in the hopes that I will be able to get a salary increase. Unfortunately, the management decided they want to change the direction in which the company is going and my boss was let go. Shortly after, we got a new boss and nobody had his appraisal that year from the department. Waited almost another year for the next appraisal, for which I have asked multiple times, over a time span of 2 months, and finally had the meeting and at the end of the meeting finally asked for a raise.</p>\n\n<p>Off-topic: The raise mentioned above is quite big in %, almost 30% but considering that even with that raise for my current experience I will be on par with the job market or even lower. I am not justifying my asked increase based on the fact that I've been doing this for over 2 years, but based on the market and what they would need to spend to replace me. I'd like to point out that I received a positive feedback in the appraisal and was told to keep up the good work.</p>\n\n<h2>Back to the salary negotiation</h2>\n\n<p>I didn't get a no from my boss for my asked raise, just that he needs to talk to HR. I was pretty happy back then because I thought that even if in the event in which I wasn't to going to get exactly what I asked for, I would be happy with even a slightly lower increase (20-25%). Now 3 months and a half passed and I have asked 4 times about the status of my request and stating that this is important to me not only due to the financial part but this would reflect how the company values me. Every time, I get more or less the same answer: still waiting for an answer from HR (my boss has a very important position in the company and probably he is not being honest as this salary increase should be very well in his power).</p>\n\n<h2>Notes:</h2>\n\n<p>This question is not about the %. As mentioned before, I didn't get a \"no\" for one second or a remark that it's too much.</p>\n\n<p>I love working here and I have spend a lot of time to learn the specifics of this company, I would like to do everything in my power to avoid leaving.</p>\n\n<p>The company is looking for months for someone to replace the colleague who left and they haven't been able to do it so far (mostly because with the set of skills asked, those people are already working as consultants and earning more). Note: the colleague which left the company, left for the same reason: asked for a raise and he got a \"no\". But at least he got an answer pretty fast...</p>\n\n<h2>Question</h2>\n\n<p>How should I continue from here? Should I try to be more pushy and ask again if he's (boss) happy with my performance and if the answer is \"yes\" then go ahead and ask firmly to have my situation finalized. Is it normal that it takes this long for an answer, or this would show a complete lack of interest for the employee? My goal is to at least get a \"no\" or a \"yes\", tired of waiting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Probably not a duplicate of \"How to approach my boss if I'm feeling underpaid\". I have already read that even before I had my first negotiation and followed the advices there to discus about my achievements and why I should I be getting a raise. Now it's a matter of done that and <strong>now what</strong>?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit nr. 2</strong>: Since I can't add a comment to Joe's answer due to the low reputation, I'll type additional info here. First of all, thank you Joe, long time reader of your answers here. My boss talked to HR for sure at least once, because there was also the discussion if they should change my contract type to have more hours included, to that HR sent back quite fast a \"no\" because I am not above a certain trigger that they are having. I know that they can't afford losing another team member because due to the specifics of the job, it takes 6 months to 1 year to get familiarized with all the custom tools and how they are built (can be faster for a fast learner). Now, I don't know why would HR drag this, the only reason I could think of, is they are first looking for a replacement for my colleague and once they have that they will say \"no\" to me.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

Their theory being \"they're paid to work in that area, so they must be experts\"...</p>\n\n<p>In each case, I've already presented my understanding of the problem and my proposed solution. Each and every time, the consultants produce a report that supports my conclusions (but often goes into less detail - as I've had the advantage of examining the original issue over more time).</p>\n\n<p>Then, what usually happens is that I've gained some \"business credibility\" in subject \"A\", but if a problem ever occurs with topic \"B\" it'll be the same uphill battle all over again.</p>\n\n<p>I've also seen attitudes resembling:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"We don't know, so you can't know.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If they've had an issue for months or years, then you join and suggest something they haven't tried, there's almost a willful refusal to consider the possibility.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The consultants are employed by the vendor/OEM, so they must know.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even when it's a relatively trivial issue, they'll assume they need an oracle on the subject (thinking along the lines of \"we have a Java issue, James Gosling must be the only person able to help us\").</p>\n\n<p>Now, I'd hope that I have a reasonably realistic assessment of my own abilities (or lack thereof), so when there's a problem outside of my \"domain\" I'll just do everything possible to stay out of the way and absorb the knowledge demonstrated by whoever gets tasked with resolving it (basically, I don't pretend to know what I don't know about). </p>\n\n<p><strong>How can I convince my employer that I have the level of competence they require when it's in an area where they lack the expertise to assess competence?</strong> </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>A few people commenting and answering have missed a nuance to my question. The people I'm working with are not incompetent in general (quite the opposite in fact), they simply lack competence <strong>for a given skill</strong> - usually on a rare topic.</p>\n\n<p>This means I do not patronize, talk down to them or speak to them with any disdain or disrespect (as some answerers have assumed). In fact, when the topic is in an area they have a degree of familiarity with, I find it very easy to get \"buy-in\" and support for my ideas. The only time I encounter any issues is when they lack the tools to assess my competence in a skill they lack themselves.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " <p>The best way to prevent the race for a consultant is present a convincing business case that doesn't include a consultant.  From the business cases I've developed the main points are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Thoroughly define the problem being solved - Do not include your solution within the problem definition.  Concisely state the problem in business terms rather than technical terms.  For example \"Based on submitted bug reports customers find feature X confusing.  This confusion leads to frustration and reduces engagement in the overall product.\" is much better than \"The UI of feature X is flawed in these ways...\" because it states the problem in terms of business value.  In terms of solution ownership this shows that you understand the issue from a business perspective which is key since this is the same perspective that the decision makers will be looking from.  This will get everyone on the same page as to what the problem is from a high level.</li>\n<li>State your solution along with several other possible plans of\naction including the null case of doing nothing and state the\ncosts/benefits for each. For the above example I would go through\ndoing nothing, scrapping feature X, improving user training/help\ndocuments, reworking the UI on feature X.  This shows that you have\nlooked at the issue from several sides rather than immediately\nhopping onto your pet solution to the exclusion of all others.</li>\n<li>Show how you can effectively test if your solution eliminates the\nproblem.  This is huge in selling non-technical people on technical\nsolutions.  They want assurance that their investment is working so\nif you can give them concrete parameters and a way to measure\nsuccess.  If the definition of success is murky it is\npsychologically much harder to buy in to an idea.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My best real world example regarding going to a consultant is imagine you go to a mechanic for routine inspection.  If you hear \"Your garbles are cracked.  It's $800 to change them out.  Should I go ahead with that?\"  you are not going to be very confident in your ability to know if your money is being well spent and you may get a second opinion.  If you hear \"Your garbles are slightly cracked which could lead to your steering failing if you hit a pothole.  We could wait and see but that's risky.  I could weld across the crack for $500 but I wouldn't trust it long run.  It would be $800 to swap them out.  Swapping them out is the only way we can be sure they will hold.  What do you want me to do?\" you are going to feel more empowered to make a good decision even if the ultimate decision is the same.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note in a lot of places you are going to be fighting the culture to make headway on this.  Don't take it personally if the default answer is consultancy, just continue to work on your sales skills for selling your ideas to management.  When a decision goes against you on this remember that you may be missing pieces of the bigger picture (ie cost of failure may be higher than it generally appears due to interdependencies) or the opportunity cost for you doing this project rather than something else might be too high.</p>\n"

I've been daydreaming about what the hiring process might be like, when there's only me in the beginning. Technology interviews are notorious for testing people on things which don't necessarily predict the quality of the hire.</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking of doing something like this.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Candidate sends their CV, gets a phone call, and an interview on the order of, say one hour.

Also for the first week the candidate could be fired at any moment, this might create a threatening atmosphere.

You'd be asking them to take another vacation day to work with you (unless you plan on them doing their time-limited tasks after they put in a full day at their current employer).  Then you'd be asking them to take a week of vacation to work with you for a week which likely also takes some time to arrange.  And only then, after burning through a large chunk of their vacation hours, you would potentially offer them a probationary contract that would allow them to consider giving two weeks notice at their current employer.  That certainly reduces your risk of hiring someone that isn't going to be productive but it means that the candidate is taking a tremendous risk.  </p>\n\n<p>Of course, it creates a number of risks for you.  There is some intellectual property risk.  Depending on the candidate's current employment agreement, you might find that their current employer has rights to the code that they write for you.  There is a timing risk.  You're going to have to wait for them to arrange a vacation day and then to arrange a vacation week and then to put in their notice before they can stat their probationary contract.  That's a fair amount of waiting and coordinating.  If you're a slow-moving Fortune 500, that might not be a huge issue.  If you're a fast-moving startup, an interview process that stretches over a month or two would be problematic.</p>\n\n<p>If you decide that you'll only hire folks that are currently unemployed, which will severely restrict the pool of solid candidates, then you just have the logistical problems.  Getting a new employee set up is a fair amount of work particularly when you're going to measure their first day output and can't afford a hiccup when something doesn't work smoothly.  And there is a lot of employment paperwork that needs to happen to make sure that you do the proper witholding, send out the proper tax forms at the end of the year, you've got the appropriate NDAs an the like.  From the employee standpoint, the extra work involved in doing a single day of contract work may well cost them more in tax preparation fees than they'd make.  And that may interfere with their unemployment benefits.</p>\n\n<p>And unless you are doing something terribly repetitive and uninteresting, expecting someone to deliver a lot of value in a single day or a single week is probably optimistic.  People take time to come up to speed on an existing code base, understand your architecture, get their environment set up for maximum productivity, etc.  If you're just asking them to make small tweaks in very localized pieces of code based on fully developed specs, that might be enough time.  But that won't tell you a whole lot about their ability to do the more involved tasks that you're likely hiring them for.</p>\n"
