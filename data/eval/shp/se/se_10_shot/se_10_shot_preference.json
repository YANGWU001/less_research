Also when I go through his code I find stuff that I do not like, that is not well done. So I want to change every little thing he does, this is again micromanaging. On the other hand I do want things to get done properly and if I am going to change everything he does, then I might do everything myself, because it pretty much takes me the same amount of time. Then I do not know why we would pick a student to help us. However we cannot do this alone, it's too much work and we are supposed to mentor students and produce PhDs, it's even good for my CV to show that I mentored students.</p>\n<p>I am not sure how to deal with this, there are many factors at play and I would like to know how people here deal with these problems.</p>\n<p>Cheers.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: <p>One of my colleagues at my institution, Prof. A, is the editor of a journal, Journal X, (and I am not involved in the journal in any way). I received an email by a professor, Prof. B, who had submitted two articles to Journal X and accuses Prof. A. of intentionally delaying the publication of these articles by not handling them properly. Prof. B claims that Prof. A did not answer his queries per email and that another editor of Journal X also did not answer his emails. The email I got from Prof. B was openly targeted to several other colleagues at my institution and also to a number of other people I do not know and also to Prof A. At the end of his email, Prof. B asks me (and the others - more or less verbatim) \"Is this attitude of Prof. A normal or are there any unethical elements [...]?\" and to \"join in this story\". </p>\n\n<p>I found it disturbing that Prof. B wrote such an email to such an audience and I would say that his way of addressing the situation was not ok. However, I wonder what my reaction should be. Normally, I would just stop by at Prof. A's office, but I am on sabbatical leave so this is not an option. I do not know more details about the issue of the publication, but I think that these do not really matter in this case, as I only want to ask about what I should do:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Should I answer Prof. B that this way of addressing the issue was not ok?</li>\n<li>Should I inform Prof. A that I found this email inappropriate?</li>\n<li>Should I just act as if I haven't read this email?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I would especially appreciate answers from people with experience on an editorial board, but other guiding comments are also helpful.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

First of all, you are one of a long list of recipients, so it would be quite unreasonable for Prof. B to expect each and every recipient of the email to set aside their work and life to dedicate themselves to studying in detail the situation he is describing and then write an equally detailed reply. Basically, to put it bluntly, Prof. B's email can be reasonably classified as spam and there is certainly no obligation to reply to it in any way.</p>\n\n<p>Second of all, you are on sabbatical, which is a sacred time you should devote to nurturing your own interests and passions and ignoring the daily trivia and tedium of academic life.

            " <p>Minimum conditions for ensuring this - or any other - paper doesn't hurt your career:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The research findings must be sound.</strong> don't get tempted into writing, or being listed as a co-author for, papers presenting research when you're \"not convinced about the quality\" of the research findings; or 'fluffy' papers which don't really present much at all; or mere rehashes of other results etc.</li>\n<li><strong>The paper must be relatively well-written</strong> - both in terms of language and in terms of structure and narrative flow. Now, I say 'relatively' because this is often hard to get right with the pressure of time and page limits; and with English not being the native language of most researches. So, readers will be somewhat tolerant about this point - but if you write something that is just very hard to follow, or in very poor English, that doesn't reflect well on you.</li>\n<li><p><strong>Unfortunately, attention must be paid to the venue of publication.</strong> I must first qualify that... obviously some publications are more highly-regarded w.r.t. their filtering process and the typical quality of articles they carry, and some less so. The thing is, I believe one should not assume that if a paper is published in a 'weaker' journal, that necessarily means it's bad - and if someone is evaluating your qualifications as an academic they should bother to skim the paper itself and make up their own mind. That doesn't always/often happen, so people may well judge your work by looking at where you've published. Of course, this is not something binary (\"good\" journals and \"bad\" journals, or conferences) -  but having mostly obscure venues in your list of publications does reflect poorly on you, and in some fields I guess there are venues you should actively avoid even at the price of no publication.</p>\n\n<p>Having said all that - for your first publication, as long as it's not a disreputable venue, it doesn't matter much. Most people \"start out small\".</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The last point, about venues, is also a sort of a safety guarantee for you: If you submit a paper to a conference or journal with a good peer-review process, and you're accepted, then it's highly likely that your paper is actually pretty good, and even more likely that it will reflect favorably on you (the converse is not necessarily true of course; lots of good papers get rejected).</p>\n"

The one risk to you that I see is making a serious and unproven accusation, assuming that the parties would not confess.

If so, the difference may be due to space used for <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4878\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\"local snapshots\"</a> (essentially, backups to the local disk when your real backup disk is not available). Local snapshots are automatically deleted when the space is needed for something else (actually, it starts purging them when the volume reaches 80% full), so the Finder treats them as free space. <code>du</code>, on the other hand, sees them as used space (as do Disk Utility and System Information).</p>\n\n<p>To find out if this is what's going on, take a look in System Information: From the Apple Menu, choose \"About This Mac\", then click \"More Info\", then select the Storage tab, and look for a light purple (\"Backups\") band on the usage chart. If it's around 47GB, this is the source of the difference.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to disable this feature, you can use the Terminal command <code>sudo tmutil disablelocal</code> -- but I recommend leaving it enabled, as it does provide some useful protection against accidental deletion/file damage/etc when your real backup is not available.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: As @chillin pointed out, there's an additional source of confusion: <code>df</code> and the Finder are using different units to report the sizes. <code>df</code> is using Gibibytes (=1,073,741,824 bytes), while the Finder is using Gigabytes (=1,000,000,000 bytes). If the Finder had reported in GiB, it would've said Capacity: 232.96 GiB, Available: 166.41 GiB, Used: 66.55 GiB. So there was actually about 52 GiB used for the local snapshots.</p>\n",

            " <p>The bug is playlist-specific and is created when you right-click a song in a playlist in a folder and choose \"add to new playlist\". This playlist will function properly in all ways except when when iTunes auto-generates a playlist containing all songs from a folder it does not recognize the said playlist. The playlist will be bugged until moved to another folder.</p>\n\n<p>There are several ways to resolve this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Fix a bugged playlist</p>\n\n<p>If you know what playlist has the bug, simply move the playlist in and out of the folder once.</p></li>\n<li><p>Avoid creating new playlists with this issue</p>\n\n<p>Use <kbd>Cmd-N</kbd> (or on Windows <kbd>Ctrl-N</kbd>) to create a new playlist instead of \"add to new playlist\". </p></li>\n<li><p>Fix all bugged playlists</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Make a folder containing all your smart-playlists. </li>\n<li>Put all other (non-smart) playlists and playlist folders into a new folder. </li>\n<li>Create a smart-playlist outside the new folder which is set to generate all songs that are NOT in the new folder. </li>\n<li>Right click each song in the new smart-playlist and move mouse over \"show in playlist\". If the result contains a non-smart playlist then that playlist is bugged, so fix it according to #1. If the result contains nothing, or only smart-playlists, then organize this song into a playlist which will remove it from this smart playlist. When this smart playlist is empty your library is not only bug-clean but all your songs exist in at least one playlist. You can keep this smart playlist for the future to find new bugged playlists and to help you keep your music library well organized. </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Fix all bugged playlists (simplified)</p>\n\n<p>If you dont want to go through all your non-playlist-organized-songs - because your library is a mess and you are too lazy to clean it up - then you should to do a manual re-set of each folder. The most efficient I have found to do this is to create a new folder in each folder, drag each other playlist and folder in OLD into NEW, then drag out NEW to the parent directory and then delete the now empty OLD. This will fix all bugged playlists. Now you need to fix all your smart-playlists which were pointing at folders, since the folders have been replaced.</p>\n\n<p>Also, since you did not use #3 you need to be very careful to always follow follow #2 to not create new bugged playlists, since it could result in you needing to redo #4 once again. </p></li>\n</ol>\n"

I will run a man page on the command and reference the other questions entry to get a better understanding of the command. One was about using <code>chkconfig</code>. Sometimes the command line I reference has a switch that is not referenced in the man page. My question is am I missing something or is there an additional set of information that references more than the man page?</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example:</p>\n\n<p><code>chkconfig  --level 3  squid off</code></p>\n\n<p><code>--level</code> is not listed in the man page. Using the man I would've used <code>chkconfig --edit</code> and worked it that way.

You gonna see a button with your username, no \"login\" button.</li>\n<li>Correcting things: Setting a new password. Set the same old one, to keyring dont get confused again, or it will ask you for the password again, after login with password provided. Go to same menu of item 1 and choose last item now (<strong>User Accounts...</strong>) and on this Gui interface , unlock on the respective button probably providing no password at all (just Enter, if this not works try with old pass..), and then <strong><em>THE GREAT MAGIC TRICK</em></strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>CLICK THE PASSWORD BOX (its a hidden button, oh devil UI)</p>\n\n<p>this open a dialog box (!) where u probably hit the \"login without password\" option AND with automatic login option ON too (outside this dialog, on User Accounts screen).

So, choose the right option now:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Set a password now</strong></p>\n\n<p>and after doing all the entry password stuff, simple hit enter, set automatic login off, to feel again the  pleasure of having a password, and if you want it on again, ok, turn it on, but dont log in without a password again. =D</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps you to solve your problem.

It roughly means \"Don't hide from the world what a wonderful person you truly are.\" </p>\n\n<p>Quite a lot of popular songs use the phrase. Off the top of my head, John Lennon's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_Karma!\" rel=\"nofollow\">Instant Karma</a>, Pink Floyd's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shine_On_You_Crazy_Diamond\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shine On You Crazy Diamond</a>, and the old Gospel song <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Little_Light_of_Mine\" rel=\"nofollow\">This Little Light of Mine</a>.

            " <p>The correct meaning for \"shine it on\"dates back to 1931, when the county of Los Angeles Probation Department established its first forestry camp for at risk youths. This became the model for the federal CCC conservation camps. As part of their uniforms the kids wore hard hats with a silver metal brim, which they were expected to keep highly polished, ie. shiny. While wearing them on a work detail, if another kid attempted to irritate or provoke you usually a friend would counsel you to \"shine it, or him, on\" meaning to tilt your head down so that the would-be provocateur could only see his own reflection in the brim of your hat. </p>\n\n<p>As result of the five juvenile deaths sustained during the 1955 Hacienda fire juvenile firefighting activities were sharply curtailed. The camps continued to operate but they now engaged in fire prevention such as brush clearance and not in direct fire suppression. I understand that at present there is one probation camp for older youth, Camp Routh, where the kids do fight fires. Don't know if they still wear those shiny helmets, though.</p>\n",

The sneaker chain\u2019s sales per square foot have been <strong>on a tear</strong> even as the company\u2019s store count shrinks.

I suspected it could be \u201cin a tier,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t add up in the context.</p>\n\n<p>However, I found \u2018on a tear\u2019 in Collins English Dictionary and urban dictionary.</p>\n\n<p>Collins defines \u2018on a tear\u2019 as;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(slang) showing a sudden burst of energy. ex.

The market is <em>on a tear</em>! \u2013 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And, Google Ngram shows that the usages of both \u2018on a tear\u2019 and \u2018in a tear\u2019 have been observed since early before 1840. The incidences of \u2018on a tear\u2019 is on rise from 0.000001 in 1970 to 0.0000025 after 2000 and onward, but incidences of 'in a tear' have been flattened out at the low level of 0.0000012 - 0.0000016 throughout the tracked period. </p>\n\n<p>Now here are my questions: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What is the plain and exact meaning of \u2018on (in) a tear\u2019 in the context of the above quote?</li>\n<li>Is \u2018on (in) a tear\u2019 a popular idiom?</li>\n<li>Why none of major English dictionaries such as CED, OED, OALED, MWED accommodates this phrase as an idiom in spite of a long presence of the phrase as shown in Google NGram?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Barrons\u2019 magazine seems to be fond of using \"on a tear.\"  It repeated this phrase again in its June 19 news-report (through AFN radio broadcast) reporting a marked improvement of U.S.'s largest closeout chain, Big Lots\u2019 sales performance.

I find no Google Books results at all for \"he was in a tear\" and most of the results for \"he was on a tear\" are using the winning streak or drunken idioms. A search for \"was in a tear\" turned up only the above three quotes, all by and about women, and \"she was on a tear\" shows examples of the usage I've described in all of the quotes visible on the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22she%20was%20on%20a%20tear%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">first page of results</a>. I wonder if this gendered split in usage holds true in spoken English, as well (I'm female, and this is the first definition that springs to mind for me, not the sports or drinking definitions).</p>\n",
            " <p>I have often heard the phrase \"on a tare\" my entire life, growing up in the south. We always use it to refer to a person who is really mad/upset for an extended period of time. \"Her husband bought her a vacuum for Valentine's Day, so she's been on a tare all week.\"</p>\n",
            " <p>It seems to me that most of these answers are correct to a degree. I became interested in the phrase after coming across it in the folk-song \"Mick Maguire\". Here is the last verse (or last refrain):\n<em>Johnny come up to the fire come up you're sitting in the draught/\nCan't you see it's ould Maguire and he nearly drives me daft/\nSure I don't know what gets into him and he's always on the tear/\nSo sit where you are and never you dare, to give ould Maguire the chair</em></p>\n\n<p>In this context - and the context of the rest of the song - its meaning would be \"ranting and complaining\". It's possible it could be \"drunk\" but it seems unlikely to me, as there are no references to drink.</p>\n"

There is a more general technique that can fix almost any animation bug, but only on PC. Open the console and run this command:</p>\n<pre><code>pushactoraway player 1\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then close the console and wait for the player to finish the &quot;stand up&quot; animation (it takes a few seconds). In the vast majority of situations, this will completely fix the problem, because it puts the player into a ragdoll state and cancels any ongoing animations. However, you should consider the following caveats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always save the game before using the console.</li>\n<li>If you are swimming (or in a glitched running-underwater state), get to dry land first. This technique will not fix swim states, and may actually break them.</li>\n<li>I have not extensively tested how this interacts with mounts. If you are riding a horse or dragon, this might not work as expected.</li>\n<li>If your character is in an animation-driven state (i.e. you can't move around normally because the dragonborn is &quot;doing something&quot; like using a forge or sitting on a chair), then it is probably safer to get to a movement-driven state first. In other words, close the crafting menu, stand up from the chair, etc., so that your character moves normally when you hit the WASD keys (or manipulate the joystick on your gamepad).</li>\n<li>If you use mods which trigger custom animations, arm offsets, etc., then this might cause issues with those mods if they do not correctly handle the &quot;get up&quot; animation. That would be a bug in the mod, because Unrelenting Force (which can be used against the player by certain draugr) can also trigger the ragdoll state, so those mods should already be handling it correctly anyway.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Non-PC players can probably get away with saving and reloading the game, but you might need to completely exit the game (or restart the console) as well, because animation state might persist over a save/load.</p>\n<p>You can replace &quot;player&quot; with the refID of a misbehaving NPC, if you want to fix their animations instead. Unfortunately, clicking on NPCs to target them does not work for the purposes of this command (instead, it sets the point from which the Havok impulse originates, which is largely useless as we just want to trigger the ragdoll state).</p>\n"

The one with the purple water and the platforms. We figured out that we need to jump on each one at a time in a line, but after getting to the 5th- 6th platform, no more will appear. The very first platform will turn red and eventually go down. By doing a bunch of jumping around, we can occasionally get 1 more platform to come up. Regardless, we cannot proceed past this point.</p>\n\n<p>I looked up several guides, and not a single one discussed player count requirements or how to get past this with less than a full party.

P. 109-146), Dirac wrote that, to derive what is now known as the Dirac equation, he had played with mathematical formulas, and he needed the Pauli matrices $\\sigma_1,\\sigma_2,\\sigma_3$ to describe the spin of electron. He noticed that a square of $p_1\\sigma_1+p_2\\sigma_2+p_3\\sigma_3$ (where $p_1,p_2,p_3$ are the three components of momentum) yields $p_1^2+p_2^2+p_3^2$ and was excited by this mathematical result. However, he could not extend this result to a sum of 4 squares (required for special relativity) until he switched from the Pauli matrices to 4x4 matrices. Therefore, I would say, Dirac started with matrices due to the previous success of the Pauli matrices.</p>\n\n<p>As for your question \"Do we need matrices in the Dirac equation?\", my recent result might be relevant: the Dirac equation is generally equivalent to one fourth order equation for one unknown (see my article <a href=\"http://akhmeteli.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/JMAPAQ528082303_1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://akhmeteli.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/JMAPAQ528082303_1.pdf</a> (JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS 52, 082303 (2011)).

For performance reasons, the process memory protection only applies to sensitive data; sensitive data here includes for instance the master key and entry passwords, but not user names, notes and file attachments. Note that this has nothing to do with the encryption of database files; in database files, all data (including user names, etc.) is encrypted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, KeePass erases all security-critical memory (if possible) when it is not needed anymore, i.e. it overwrites these memory areas before releasing them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For some operations, KeePass must make sensitive data available unencryptedly in the process memory. For example, in order to show a password in the standard list view control provided by Windows, KeePass must supply the cell content (the password) as unencrypted string (unless hiding using asterisks is enabled). Operations that result in unencrypted data in the process memory include, but are not limited to: displaying data (not asterisks) in standard controls, searching data, replacing placeholders (during auto-type, drag&amp;drop, copying to clipboard, ...), importing/exporting files (except KDBX) and loading/saving unencrypted files. Windows and .NET may make copies of the data (in the process memory) that cannot be erased by KeePass.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A 2019 <a href=\"https://www.ise.io/casestudies/password-manager-hacking/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">study</a> linked on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/KeePass/comments/i3x016/comment/g0f7vt8/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Reddit</a> (using KeePass 2.40) has demonstrated how passwords can be left in memory unencrypted. This applies only to passwords you have interacted with in the open session, and does not apply to the master password. Apparently, there is no difference in security regarding this issue with locked or unlocked state. (Obviously, locked state still prevents people from using your Keepass file if you leave your device unlocked and unattended.)

Though Keepass <a href=\"https://keepass.info/help/v2/autotype_obfuscation.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">offers some protection against keyloggers</a>, I am not sure whether it applies to the master password. If not, you could still use an additional master key file to mitigate this issue.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So the question remains open how much additional security the habit of always closing (not only locking!) Keepass as soon as possible really offers in practice.</p>\n<p>As an idea for a tradeoff between security and convenience, you could use two Keepass files: One you close as soon as possible that you use for super-sensitive data like email logins, banking logins, crypto asset keys etc.; and another one you leave open for a long period of time that you use for less sensitive data like message board logins etc.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer:\nI am not a security expert, only a professional software developer.</p>\n"

It admittedly <strong>tries its best</strong> to protect your passwords (but not your user names etc.) in memory:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While KeePass is running, sensitive data is stored encryptedly in the process memory. This means that even if you would dump the KeePass process memory to disk, you could not find any sensitive data. For performance reasons, the process memory protection only applies to sensitive data; sensitive data here includes for instance the master key and entry passwords, but not user names, notes and file attachments. Note that this has nothing to do with the encryption of database files; in database files, all data (including user names, etc.) is encrypted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, KeePass erases all security-critical memory (if possible) when it is not needed anymore, i.e. it overwrites these memory areas before releasing them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For some operations, KeePass must make sensitive data available unencryptedly in the process memory. For example, in order to show a password in the standard list view control provided by Windows, KeePass must supply the cell content (the password) as unencrypted string (unless hiding using asterisks is enabled). Operations that result in unencrypted data in the process memory include, but are not limited to: displaying data (not asterisks) in standard controls, searching data, replacing placeholders (during auto-type, drag&amp;drop, copying to clipboard, ...), importing/exporting files (except KDBX) and loading/saving unencrypted files. Windows and .NET may make copies of the data (in the process memory) that cannot be erased by KeePass.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A 2019 <a href=\"https://www.ise.io/casestudies/password-manager-hacking/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">study</a> linked on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/KeePass/comments/i3x016/comment/g0f7vt8/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Reddit</a> (using KeePass 2.40) has demonstrated how passwords can be left in memory unencrypted. This applies only to passwords you have interacted with in the open session, and does not apply to the master password. Apparently, there is no difference in security regarding this issue with locked or unlocked state. (Obviously, locked state still prevents people from using your Keepass file if you leave your device unlocked and unattended.) They conclude:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>End users should, as always, employ security best practices to limit exposure to adversarial activity, such as:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(...)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shutting a password manager down completely when not in use even in a locked state (If using one that doesn\u2019t properly sanitize secrets upon being placed into a locked running state)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, there is only a threat if there is malware on your device. So, it could also be that the malware</p>\n<ul>\n<li>steals your sensitive data in the few seconds you have Keepass opened.</li>\n<li>is a keylogger. Though Keepass <a href=\"https://keepass.info/help/v2/autotype_obfuscation.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">offers some protection against keyloggers</a>, I am not sure whether it applies to the master password. If not, you could still use an additional master key file to mitigate this issue.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So the question remains open how much additional security the habit of always closing (not only locking!) Keepass as soon as possible really offers in practice.</p>\n<p>As an idea for a tradeoff between security and convenience, you could use two Keepass files: One you close as soon as possible that you use for super-sensitive data like email logins, banking logins, crypto asset keys etc.; and another one you leave open for a long period of time that you use for less sensitive data like message board logins etc.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer:\nI am not a security expert, only a professional software developer.</p>\n"

Again, this is not something that any individual e-mail service provider can effect.  They may conceivably be able to facilitate this between their own users, but they do not have the same power to protect e-mails going to/from external endpoints.</p>\n\n<p>SSL/TLS are technologies commonly used to secure communications between clients and servers and from server-to-server.  However, here we again run into a similar situation as with S/MIME - both parties to the conversation must support it.  While some service providers may do this, no service provider can guarantee you that SSL/TLS will be applied to every message you send because they do not have control over what the receiving server is configured to support.</p>\n\n<p>To address your concerns more concisely, point-by-point:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>None of the above use S/MIME.  While it would be a nice feature for them to support in their web clients, it would be infeasible for them to guarantee that it will work for all recipients.  You can get around this to some degree by using your own e-mail client with S/MIME support, instead of using the web interfaces.  However, again, this will only work where you have coordinated this with your intended recipients.</p></li>\n<li><p>SSL/TLS is commonly used to protect the web sessions by which e-mails are composed, and the client connections by which they are sent.  It's also used to protect server-to-server communications along the way, but no service provider can guarantee that every recipient's e-mail servers or client will support and maintain that protection along the way.</p></li>\n<li><p>Many providers do use SSL/TLS, but you should check with yours yourself if you're concerned.  Again, though, this cannot guarantee that your e-mail is protected through transmission and storage every step along the way to every recipient.</p></li>\n<li><p>Any time you are sending/receiving e-mail which is not protected by S/MIME, PGP, or a similar end-to-end encryption solution, you must assume that the message has been transmitted or stored in the clear, or in another form readable by a third-party, <em>somewhere</em>.  </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The last point touches on an issue I've not yet addressed - e-mail storage on the server.  All e-mail service providers, by the nature of their service, must store e-mails exactly as they were received or by using some form of encryption that they themselves can reverse.  Otherwise, they will not be able to forward the e-mail on in a readable format to others or display it to you in your web browser.  If you're not using end-to-end encryption, that means your e-mail is being effectively stored in the clear.  This leaves it vulnerable to malicious insiders, or anyone who manages to hack into your e-mail account or the server's database.</p>\n",
            " <ol>\n<li>No</li>\n<li>SSL is used but not as an S/MIME replacement</li>\n<li>Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail allow you to access your e-mail via SSL. And similarly will send e-mails using SSL but only <em>where possible</em>. It's difficult to say whether <strong>all</strong> providers do either.</li>\n<li>Pretty much <strong>always</strong>. It is very difficult to guarantee security with these providers without using something on top like PGP. Sure if you send from Gmail to Gmail there's a good chance it will be safe but <em>no guarantee</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n",
            " <p>2 SSL is used in two ways and while the providers seem to be pretty consistent about using it for server to client communications, they vary using it for server to server communication.</p>\n\n<p>I ran some tests and while Gmail and Yahoo both use encryption if both sides support it, Hotmail never uses it for server to server communications.  This means that communication between Hotmail and other internet providers is always in clear text</p>\n",
            " <p>1) In general S/MIME is not supported by Gmail, Yahoo, etc when using their web-based email client (i.e. going to www.gmail.com). If you want to use S/MIME with these services you have to use a 3rd party email client (i.e Mozilla Thunderbird, MS Outlook, etc) and have a way to manage and distribute your public and private keys. The reason it is not easy to use S/MIME with Gmail etc is because the primary source of revenue for these companies is targeted advertising. The primary source of information used to target that advertising is the content of your emails. If they make it easy for you to use S/MIME for end-to-end encryption (so that they can no longer scan your emails) it undercuts their primary source of revenue (information about you).</p>\n\n<p>2) Yes, but keep in mind that protection is often partial or incomplete. Just because the email service provider allows you to connect via SSL/TLS does not mean they support SSL/TLS connections to <em>other</em> email service providers. See 4) below.</p>\n\n<p>3) <strong>No</strong>, ~50% of emails travel to or through providers that do not support SSL/TLS. I believe AOL only started supporting SSL/TLS connections in 2014 (via their web-based email client). See 4) below. </p>\n\n<p>4) Under common conditions emails are not secure for several reasons. First, the email provider is scanning the incoming and outgoing emails to provide targeted advertising. Second, ~50% of the time the connections between the various email service providers do not support ANY encryption so the emails traveling between these providers must be sent as plain text. You have no ability to control this process because it is the connection between the providers. For example, if you send a email from your Gmail account to a friend with a Yahoo account the email must be transmitted from Google's servers to Yahoo's servers. The security of that connection depends he willingness of on Google and Yahoo to work together. I believe Google and Yahoo only recently started supporting encrypted connections to each-other. Google posted some data about this in June (2014).

I understand the basic implications of the principle, but I wonder if using the halting problem isn't a convenient excuse to justify the dismal state of cybersecurity? What applicability does the halting problem actually have to cybersecurity applications, such as malware detection or vulnerability detection?</p>\n\n<p>The way I see it, the halting problem states that it's not possible to write a general purpose program which can make 100% accurate determinations about the behavior of every single possible program. I'm thinking of a program that analyzes software to determine if it's malicious, or a program that analyzes software to determine if it contains buffer overflow or SQLi vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n<p>The proof relies on a special, contrived program to show this paradox. This doesn't mean that <em>no programs</em> can be analyzed by another program with 100% accuracy, nor even that a large majority of real-world programs can't be reliably analyzed by another program with 100% accuracy.</p>\n\n<p>My final question is can an attacker use the halting problem as a form of an attack? E.g. whatever analysis program you have written to detect the attacker's presence or activity, can the attack write a program with the same provable behavior of making your detection algorithm undecidable?</p>\n\n<p>Any pointers to real-world research or established experts on this subject is much appreciated.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>Established expert... that would be me (although not under this name -- I use a pseudonym because I am tremendously humble). Allow me to answer, then.</p>\n\n<p>The \"halting problem\" is indeed an illustration of the impossibility to decide (for a computer) whether a given program will halt or not. Of course, a lot of programs are decidable, but not all of them. People tend to think that if we could accurately \"predict the behaviour\" of computer programs, then malware would not be possible. This is oversimplistic, for the following reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The \"halting problem\" is about deciding whether a computer program will stop, <em>for a given input</em> which is known <em>a priori</em>. This model works only about programs which are pure calculation, and do no I/O. By definition, this does not apply to any application which is connected to the Internet or can be controlled by a human. As an illustration, consider an application which runs a video. This one will never stop as long as the human user clicks on the rewind button. But it may stop (and it should be easy to prove) if the user does <em>not</em> click on any button.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability_%28logic%29\">Decidability</a> is about whether a given function can be evaluated <em>at all</em>, but not whether it can be evaluated <em>efficiently</em>. If you want an antivirus to scan for malware, you want the answer within 2 or 3 seconds -- not in ten years. This notion of decidability does not capture all the things in which we are interested.</p></li>\n<li><p>We <em>can</em> have requirements. Consider a Java application.

Allow me to answer, then.</p>\n\n<p>The \"halting problem\" is indeed an illustration of the impossibility to decide (for a computer) whether a given program will halt or not. Of course, a lot of programs are decidable, but not all of them. People tend to think that if we could accurately \"predict the behaviour\" of computer programs, then malware would not be possible. This is oversimplistic, for the following reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The \"halting problem\" is about deciding whether a computer program will stop, <em>for a given input</em> which is known <em>a priori</em>. This model works only about programs which are pure calculation, and do no I/O. By definition, this does not apply to any application which is connected to the Internet or can be controlled by a human. As an illustration, consider an application which runs a video. This one will never stop as long as the human user clicks on the rewind button. But it may stop (and it should be easy to prove) if the user does <em>not</em> click on any button.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability_%28logic%29\">Decidability</a> is about whether a given function can be evaluated <em>at all</em>, but not whether it can be evaluated <em>efficiently</em>. If you want an antivirus to scan for malware, you want the answer within 2 or 3 seconds -- not in ten years. This notion of decidability does not capture all the things in which we are interested.</p></li>\n<li><p>We <em>can</em> have requirements. Consider a Java application. It is written in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode\">bytecode</a> which is amenable to (efficient) automatic proofs. Namely, the JVM will <em>prove</em>, in a very formal way, that the code complies to the type rules of Java (that it never calls a method on a class which does not feature that method).

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I have this personal rule to start all function/method names with a verb. My verb of choice for functions or methods that get a value based on some data structure or object is <em>get</em>. I'm wondering if that's a good idea.</p>\n\n<p>The good thing about <em>get</em> is that it doesn't really say anything about <em>how</em> that value is being retrieved, just get it. Something like <em>calculate</em> (apart from being awfully long) may be too much information.</p>\n\n<p>This applies to both functions and methods, i.e.:</p>\n\n<pre><code>float get_magnitude(Vector2d vector)\n{\n    return sqrt(pow(vector.x, 2), pow(vector.y, 2));\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<pre><code>float Vector2d::get_magnitude() const\n{\n    return sqrt(pow(x, 2), pow(y, 2));\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I sometimes end up with getter methods for read-only properties. It may make sense to use a more meaningful verb for anything that doesn't just return some property, and may not run in linear time.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a case to be made for either approach or is it just a matter of taste?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>For methods aimed at retrieving a value, some people just omit the verb, considering that this is just an access to a property:</p>\n\n<pre><code>float Celsius() { return self.celsius; }\n\nfloat Fahrenheit() { return self.celsius * 9.0/5.0 + 32.0; }\n</code></pre>\n",
            " <p>Consistent clear naming is good, so \"get_thingy()\" is good, but I don't see that read only versus mutable makes any difference here as you are only \"reading\" the value.</p>\n\n<p>I like \"of\" as a suffix id you need to pass a parameter as in \"get_square_of(3)\", and, if you know there is a <em>lot</em> more involved than a simple retrieval or calculation then maybe another verb like \"obtain\" can be used to indicate this as in \"obtain_meaning_of_life()\", also some people favor \"retrieve_\" to indicate the method involves some sort of I/O or external interaction. </p>\n",
            " <p>Consistency in naming functions is good, but you can also overdo it.</p>\n\n<p>If <em>every</em> function that returns a value is called <code>getSomething</code>, you are probably overdoing it. My advise would be to reserve the <code>get</code> prefix for things that are conceptually properties of the object that the function works on, even if the value is not explicitly stored in the object (like the <code>get_magnitude</code> in your example).</p>\n\n<p>If returning a value is not the most important aspect of the function, but merely a side-effect of the function's true purpose or design, then I would name the function after what it does. For example, there is no way that I would give C's <code>fopen</code> function a <code>get</code> prefix, even though the function returns an important value (a handle to the file just opened).</p>\n",
            " <p>Hmmm ... Well it's almost always a personal preference isn't it. In general, I think that naming conventions should be such that not only I understand what's going on in my source code, but also so does whoever else comes across my code.  Also, I tend to be a minimalist in code documentation; unless I am doing something very tricky, my code should be smart enough to explain itself to me even if I see it 3 years from when I wrote it in a drunken stupor. So consistency across your projects, for internal sanity is important too. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, when I use C on *nix systems, I invariably use 0 as success and negative numbers for flagging failures; with the exception on I/O functions where return is size_t; then positive number is amount of I/O; 0 is a halt on I/0 and (size_t)-1 is a fault with errno set to a system error;  this is consistent with C library behavior on the systems so I know that everyone will understand what is going on.</p>\n\n<p>When I used to write programs under Win32 using C the convention of Win32 was a bit different and I followed that convention.

What I mean is, if my convention for the accessor was customerId() and all of a sudden I'd see a function called getCusomterId() I would understand that perhaps it does more, such as going to database maybe, or iteratres some list?

    "\n\nHuman: <p>My question is about how best to organize C++ classes around a database\nmodel, and I understand this may appear very elementary.</p>\n\n<p>The software I propose to create will do the following. It is intended for\nsmall FMCG manufacturers and will use Qt.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The software will record non-conformance's, product complaints,\ncorrective actions and serve as an electronic record keeping</li>\n<li>There will be quite a bit of 'business logic', as the standout\nfeature is intended to be comprehensive reporting, searching and\nanalysis, as well as a flexible approach to entering data to smooth\nworkflows (ie, a break away from the \"one screen per process stage\"\nparadigm)</li>\n<li>The persistent store is an SQL database, with a table(s) for each\ntype of record (some records will be broken into separate tables for\ninvestigations/solutions. This means that most work will be done on a\nsingle row).</li>\n<li>Each customer who uses this software will require amendments,\nadditional columns/fields or changes in column names and maybe\nbusiness logic. Each customer may require updates which change the\ndatabase structure. The idea is that anything that can be customized, any\nclient specific requirements will live within these classes.</li>\n<li>There will be reporting, mainly involving pulling records matching\nparticular categories, word searches, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have the database schema done and laid out, and the logic of how tables\nrelate is clear.  I have used this very schema in another framework, but a web based app doesn't seem to offer the level of power to the user with regards to the GUI, which is essential to differentiate this product from the others.</p>\n\n<p>My question is how to design classes around the database. It is important to\nget this right, so that the architecture of the software doesn't have to be\nredesigned later on. The classes will not be responsible for the persistent\nstore, only for acting as an intermediary between the layer responsible for\nthe persistent store and the controllers/views.</p>\n\n<p>The most logical approach appears to be to have a class for non-conformances/complaints etc, which solely store the instance (ie, one object per non-conformance record), validate data and class specific business logic (ie, computations).  One class per table seems logical in this case.  What I'm struggling with, is whether it is standard practice to simply have data members for each column, define getters and setters, or whether I should create a class which isn't hard-coded to map to a table, but which populates a map based on the database schema or external file which defines the database and column properties. The former means that the coding for the class needs to be changed when columns are modified, the latter potentially not.  Keep in mind, for the majority of the time, each user will be working with one record at at time.</p>\n\n<p>In short, I can see example of how to do SQL queries, but I've struggled to\nfind anything which shows me what the class should look like (or if this entire approach is wrong) and I'd like to compare what I'm doing, with what the industry would define as good practice (I'm not a programmer by trade).</p>\n\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>The first question is if you are okay with having to recompile the program every time the database schema changes. I'm not quite clear on your situation but for example:</p>\n\n<p>You have a number of clients with slightly different needs (ie A needs to track Properties X, Y, Z, but B also needs to track Property W) but for a given client those needs are pretty constant. And you can work with and deploy a custom application to each client (aka you aren't selling this off the self). In that case, have a template that you can then inherit from and modify on a per client basis might be a pretty good business strategy, if the total number of clients is not high enough to make it worth creating a highly adaptable application right from the start. Having 5 different versions of the program is still maintainable, 100 is not.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you have 100 clients you simply cannot be changing the code every time one of them wants to add a property (column) to something. Or even add a new type of object. So the program will need to be more dynamic, probably working off a relational map that is saved somewhere and that can be edited by the program as needed.</p>\n\n<p>So lets assume what you have is more like the former. Having classes that represent the types of records you have is a good way to do it. Those classes can contain SQL queries directly. You should still however have things like table names as constants defined in a common .h file and then call them as constants in your actual code so any change needs to be made in only one place. Then if you need a slightly different object for a different client, you can inherit the classes you already have and make the necessary changes.</p>\n\n<p>You could also put together an intermediary class that handles actual database interactions, so if you change the schema or even the type of database you are using, you just need to switch out or modify that class.</p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Let's say I have a client that is consuming <code>Vehicle</code> objects sent from a server.</p>\n\n<p>I have two types of vehicles: <code>Car</code> and <code>Truck</code>. Some <code>Car</code>s can be <code>inHybridMode</code> but not all of them. The server currently supplies three specific models in a list: <code>Prius</code>, <code>Camaro</code>, and <code>F150</code>. In the client I have created this hierarchy:</p>\n\n<pre><code>abstract class Vehicle\n    String name;\n\nabstract class Car extends Vehicle\n\nabstract class Truck extends Vehicle\n\ninterface Hybrid\n    boolean isInHybridMode()    \n\nclass Prius extends Car, implements Hybrid\n\nclass Camaro extends Car\n\nclass F150 extends Truck\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've chosen to make <code>Hybrid</code> an interface so that the inheritance structure is not crazy (and super messy if ever got a hybrid truck).</p>\n\n<p>The client can easily create these vehicles from the server output (let's say JSON). I just check the <code>type</code> field and create the appropriate concrete class.</p>\n\n<pre><code>[\n   {\n      \"name\":\"bob's car\",\n      \"type\":\"Prius\",\n      \"inHybridMode\":true\n   },\n   {\n      \"name\":\"joe's car\",\n      \"type\":\"Camaro\"\n   }\n]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My question is, how can I handle the situation where the server returns me a vehicle that I don't (yet) have a concrete class for?</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n   \"name\":\"alice's car\",\n   \"type\":\"Camry\",\n   \"inHybridMode\":true\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My options are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Completely ignore this type and don't create an object. This will cause problems when I try to do <code>vehicles.size()</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make <code>Vehicle</code> (and <code>Car</code> and <code>Truck</code>) non-abstract and just create a <code>Vehicle</code> object with corresponding <code>name</code> field</p></li>\n<li><p>Create a new class called <code>UnknownHybrid extends Car, implements Hybrid</code>. This will act as a catch-all for any vehicle that is of unknown type and has <code>inHybridMode</code> field.</p></li>\n<li><p>Crash horribly, forcing me to implement a <code>Camry</code> class.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I like #3 now while this problem is simple, but I don't want to create catch-alls for every combination of interfaces that I later create.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>UPDATE:</p>\n\n<p>First, thanks for all of the great responses.</p>\n\n<p>In an attempt to simplify my problem for question-asking I left some things out that you identified. I'll answer those questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I actually have <code>type</code> and <code>model</code>. Type is either Car or Truck, only. Camry, Camaro, F150, etc. is the model.</p></li>\n<li><p>I only need Car, Truck, and Hybrid behavior. There is no such thing as Camry behavior, only in that it is Car + Hybrid behavior. </p>\n\n<p>I added the model classes (Camry, F150, etc.) so that I'd have a class which could implement <code>Hybrid</code> interface. I <em>think</em> I'll have fewer models than combinations of interfaces. Eventually I'll have other \"mix in\" behavior like <code>Convertible</code>, <code>4WD</code>, etc. So I thought I'd just create classes for each model instead of each combination of interface (HybridConvertibleCar, etc.)</p></li>\n<li><p>As for business requirements: display info about Car, display info about Truck, display green indicator when in Hybrid mode, handle unknown models that may or may not be hybrid, convertible, 4wd. </p>\n\n<p>The thing I'm trying to avoid (and the current implementation) is that all of the behavior for hybrid, convertible, 4wd is all contained in the <code>Vehicle</code> class. So I have a lot of models that have fields/methods that don't pertain to them. For example Truck has an <code>isConvertibleTopDown</code> method that always returns \"false\". </p></li>\n<li><p>There is more to <code>Hybrid</code> than just isInHybridMode. I just removed most of it for the sake of the question.</p></li>\n<li><p>If all I had was <code>Vehicle</code> I'd just display vehicle-specific data (e.g. <code>name</code>).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

Good luck with that.</p>\n\n<p>If <code>inHybridMode</code> is the only member of a hybrid vehicle I would not make an interface for it.

It would be somewhat \"flattening\" to your model but it would solve your problem, which is you want to be ready for the unexpected. You want a universal vehicle that will fit anything the server throws at you, a one-size-fits-all class that can survive a little tweaking at the server side.</p>\n",
            " <p>Perhaps, you should take a step back from the <em>concrete</em> problem and think about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_analysis_and_design\" rel=\"nofollow\">OOAD</a> in general.</p>\n\n<p>In general terms: In your program you are building a <code>model</code> of something. The <code>things</code> you model and <em>how</em> you model these things is completely up to you. It's like inventing a game, where you set up the rules. Whether this game makes \"any sense\", i.e. whether it serves any practical purpose and how good you achieved this purpose with your software is one of the facets, which makes the quality of our software. </p>\n\n<p>And one (popular) way to build models is <code>OOP</code>. One strength of <code>OOP</code> as such is building <em>abstract</em> groups of <code>objects</code> via <code>inheritance</code>.</p>\n\n<p>If one <code>object</code> inherits from another it has somehow a relationship or <em>similarity</em> which it shares with other members of the group.</p>\n\n<p>This is the so called <code>is-a</code>-relationship, where you form a group of objects. Languages like Java, C# etc. allow two types  of inheritance: <code>class inheritance</code> and <code>interface inheritance</code>, i.e. one thing <code>is</code> like another or <code>behaves</code> like another object. </p>\n\n<p>If I have similar objects, e.g. <code>car</code> it would make sense to model them as <code>class inheritance</code>. If I have objects, which share a common ability - <em>able to fly</em> -, it makes sense, to model them as <code>interface</code> inheritance.</p>\n\n<p>What makes <code>OOP</code> so useful is to group heterogenous objects together and treat them the same. For Example: You could tell a collection of Objects, which are able to <em>fly</em>, just to do that <code>.fly()</code> and <em>independendly</em> how they manage to do that, you are able to speak to each of them.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>From what was said above you are able to understand, that your question sounds a bit strange:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Inheritence structure to allow unknown types</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This somehow contradicts what you are trying to achive with <code>OOP</code>.\nOf course, if you are dealing with heterogenous objects you can not exactly determine <em>what</em> it does, but you know in what respect this behaviour would be <em>known</em>, since you (hopefully) modeled the groups like that.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My question is, how can I handle the situation where the server returns me a vehicle that I don't (yet) have a concrete class for?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you would ever end up in such a situation, you know, that your <em>model is just wrong</em>.</p>\n\n<p>If I take your example of <code>Trucks</code> and <code>Cars</code> and <code>being hybrid</code> - independently, whether I think you modeled it correctly:</p>\n\n<p>Whatever your front-end is able to model has to be modeled in the backend as well. Say your frontend models a <code>hybrid</code> Truck, the backend has to translate this to a call to a <code>factory</code>, which knows <em>how to deal with that</em>. </p>\n\n<p>If there is no possibility to \"build a car\" like it was \"ordered\", the result is <em>exceptional</em> behaviour.</p>\n\n<p><em>Answer:</em> Fix your model of the world.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My options are: ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <em>fix</em> would be to build a <em>better</em> abstraction. According to your model, it would make sense having an abstract factory, returning you a concrete factory, returning you a concrete object; i.e. a <em>vehicle factory</em> producing a <em>truckfactory</em> or <em>carfactory</em>, which in turn produce <em>concrete</em> (non-)<em>hybrid</em> vehicles of their kind.</p>\n\n<p>To give a more concrete advice, I need more detailed information, about what you want to achieve.  </p>\n",

I hate long commutes myself, and 12 to 15 hour days!

If you have a similar offer from the old place, why not take it and be happier?</p>\n\n<p>You should work out how to tell your boss - in a public meeting room (glass and visible) or at a one on one lunch. This is only because he is volatile, which might save you some hassle.</p>\n"

One of the supervisors who I worked closely with wrote my a one page letter of reference at my request. This supervisor used to be a high up department head for a major government regulatory agency (he has a Wikipedia page and is extremely well known by those within the industry). The reference letter he wrote me is extremely positive and highlights much of the specific work we have done together over the past 1.5 years.

But otherwise they would risk employees not willing to go to training because of the 'loyality paper'. </p>\n\n<p>There's nothing unethical in you planning to leave. It would be unethical if you'd say you don't plan to leave (in next 1-2 years) in order to get the training, but actually plan to leave. If you're sure you'll leave soon, you should however communicate it. You would leave a bad impression if it would be known you have planned to leave before the training but didn't say anything only to get the training. </p>\n\n<p>However, your company may try to make a 'moral pression' on you, that you shouldn't leave because of training.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Several times in my career, I've encountered situations where the business has a technical problem, and I have the previous experience and skills necessary to resolve the issue.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of being trusted to solve the issue, these companies have typically hired (expensive) external consultants to come in and \"save us\". Their theory being \"they're paid to work in that area, so they must be experts\"...</p>\n\n<p>In each case, I've already presented my understanding of the problem and my proposed solution. Each and every time, the consultants produce a report that supports my conclusions (but often goes into less detail - as I've had the advantage of examining the original issue over more time).</p>\n\n<p>Then, what usually happens is that I've gained some \"business credibility\" in subject \"A\", but if a problem ever occurs with topic \"B\" it'll be the same uphill battle all over again.</p>\n\n<p>I've also seen attitudes resembling:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"We don't know, so you can't know.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If they've had an issue for months or years, then you join and suggest something they haven't tried, there's almost a willful refusal to consider the possibility.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The consultants are employed by the vendor/OEM, so they must know.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even when it's a relatively trivial issue, they'll assume they need an oracle on the subject (thinking along the lines of \"we have a Java issue, James Gosling must be the only person able to help us\").</p>\n\n<p>Now, I'd hope that I have a reasonably realistic assessment of my own abilities (or lack thereof), so when there's a problem outside of my \"domain\" I'll just do everything possible to stay out of the way and absorb the knowledge demonstrated by whoever gets tasked with resolving it (basically, I don't pretend to know what I don't know about). </p>\n\n<p><strong>How can I convince my employer that I have the level of competence they require when it's in an area where they lack the expertise to assess competence?</strong> </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>A few people commenting and answering have missed a nuance to my question. The people I'm working with are not incompetent in general (quite the opposite in fact), they simply lack competence <strong>for a given skill</strong> - usually on a rare topic.</p>\n\n<p>This means I do not patronize, talk down to them or speak to them with any disdain or disrespect (as some answerers have assumed). In fact, when the topic is in an area they have a degree of familiarity with, I find it very easy to get \"buy-in\" and support for my ideas. The only time I encounter any issues is when they lack the tools to assess my competence in a skill they lack themselves.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>The best way to prevent the race for a consultant is present a convincing business case that doesn't include a consultant.  From the business cases I've developed the main points are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Thoroughly define the problem being solved - Do not include your solution within the problem definition.  Concisely state the problem in business terms rather than technical terms.  For example \"Based on submitted bug reports customers find feature X confusing.  This confusion leads to frustration and reduces engagement in the overall product.\" is much better than \"The UI of feature X is flawed in these ways...\" because it states the problem in terms of business value.  In terms of solution ownership this shows that you understand the issue from a business perspective which is key since this is the same perspective that the decision makers will be looking from.  This will get everyone on the same page as to what the problem is from a high level.</li>\n<li>State your solution along with several other possible plans of\naction including the null case of doing nothing and state the\ncosts/benefits for each. For the above example I would go through\ndoing nothing, scrapping feature X, improving user training/help\ndocuments, reworking the UI on feature X.  This shows that you have\nlooked at the issue from several sides rather than immediately\nhopping onto your pet solution to the exclusion of all others.</li>\n<li>Show how you can effectively test if your solution eliminates the\nproblem.  This is huge in selling non-technical people on technical\nsolutions.  They want assurance that their investment is working so\nif you can give them concrete parameters and a way to measure\nsuccess.  If the definition of success is murky it is\npsychologically much harder to buy in to an idea.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My best real world example regarding going to a consultant is imagine you go to a mechanic for routine inspection.  If you hear \"Your garbles are cracked.  It's $800 to change them out.  Should I go ahead with that?\"  you are not going to be very confident in your ability to know if your money is being well spent and you may get a second opinion.  If you hear \"Your garbles are slightly cracked which could lead to your steering failing if you hit a pothole.  We could wait and see but that's risky.  I could weld across the crack for $500 but I wouldn't trust it long run.  It would be $800 to swap them out.  Swapping them out is the only way we can be sure they will hold.  What do you want me to do?\" you are going to feel more empowered to make a good decision even if the ultimate decision is the same.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note in a lot of places you are going to be fighting the culture to make headway on this.  Don't take it personally if the default answer is consultancy, just continue to work on your sales skills for selling your ideas to management.  When a decision goes against you on this remember that you may be missing pieces of the bigger picture (ie cost of failure may be higher than it generally appears due to interdependencies) or the opportunity cost for you doing this project rather than something else might be too high.</p>\n",
            " <p>I've seen the same type of issue in my own past.  As noted by Myles part of the issue might be a communication problem. Often, people will not necessarily understand a technical person's description of a problem or the appropriate solution. Graphs, pictures and external supporting references sometimes confer some comfort to the reader.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of your communication skills I suggest there is a very difficult to overcome reason for such behavior as a company grows. Higher level people who are making decisions often abhor making a decision that they can be held directly accountable for. If they take a risk on a solution you propose and it doesn't work out they either stumble themselves or a strong internal resource stumbles.</p>\n\n<p>Neither is acceptable to some people.</p>\n\n<p>When a brand name consultant comes along, which of course appears to represent expertise, which at times is simply not any more advanced than internal resources, there is a nice convenient place to put the blame. I went with what the consultants proposed and so did the rest of the stakeholders involved. It came in a flashy document with loads of details which must mean it was correct.</p>\n\n<p>So, yes, if there's a problem we fire the consultant. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not a fan of this but I have seen the reins handed over to bumbling consulting and development groups too many times to discount this effect. Now, there are other good reasons, such as not having the time and resources to tackle the issue internally -- or quite simply not having a large enough team with solid skills in the area being considered even though one or two folks may.</p>\n\n<p>My viewpoint may be peppered with a touch of jaded... ;)</p>\n",
            " <p>I wonder why you oppose bringing in consultants if the end results is that something gets implemented that is just what you would have suggested, especially when afterwards everyone agrees that you totally did know what the right course of action was. Is it that you would have liked to get recognition in advance that your idea was right? Is it that you think the company is wasting money paying consultants for advice they could have had for free?</p>\n\n<p>Those external consultants (and yes, quite often I am one of them) bring a lot more into the group than the idea of what to do to get your problem solved. They bring external authority and expertise, which often sways other participants into changing their ways, far more so than a logical explanation of why a particular course of action is right. They bring a convenient scapegoat also - if someone changes how they do things because a colleague or peer said to, and it goes bad, the blame will be on the changer, but if someone changes how they do things because a highly paid external consultant said to, and it goes bad, the blame will be on the consultant. They also demonstrate, by the sheer money that is being spent on them, that management is truly committed to making this change.</p>\n\n<p>I can't tell you how many times someone has told me \"that recommendation you made today, that they've all agreed to and are starting to do? I argued for that a month ago and nobody would listen.\" I reassure them that this is a widespread phenomenon that <strong>does not</strong> (and here's where I start to actually answer your question) <strong>reflect management's actual opinion of their skill level.</strong> Let me say that again. The reason people don't take your advice, and then later take that very same advice from a paid external consultant, is <strong>not</strong> because they think you are less skilled than you are or your advice is less valuable than it is. </p>\n\n<p>Go ahead and put a little effort into showing you can solve it yourself. If they don't listen (and they probably won't) make sure you get a chance to work closely with the consultants. You can tell them what you know, which will improve the quality of the solution, you may (or may not) learn from them, and when the project succeeds you will be associated with the success. Don't get worked up about the possibility that silly old management is incapable of understanding how good you are or how simple their technical problems are. You may be right, but often there is more to a technical problem than a technical solution.</p>\n",
            " <p>My problem with the question is that it assumes the person who made the choice to hire a consultant is incompetent.  I do not think the Dunning-Kruger failure effect is the real or only reason why you are not successful in your attempts to convince people not to use consultants when you have the available skills. And really what do you gain by assuming that other people are falling into the Dunning-Kruger effect? Does this help you be effective at work in any way?  Why are you even thinking about it? It actually prevents you from seeing what you can do to improve the situation if you are stuck on the idea that other people are incompetent.</p>\n\n<p>First, if your attitude is that they just don't get me and recognize how wonderful I am, then people will pick up that you resent them and be less likely to consult you. So stop even thinking about Dunning-Kruger because it is irrelevant to getting the job done. Your post came across as pretty negative about your managers' incompetence. If I thought that, then there is a good chance that they do too. </p>\n\n<p>Next, there are so many reasons to hire consultants over your own employees to solve problems that have nothing to do with what they think of you. </p>\n\n<p>First you may be highly thought of and they don't think they can spare the time from your regular duties for you to do this.</p>\n\n<p>Second, you may not be presenting your ideas in a way that they understand. Technical people tend to focus on the technical, managers tend to focus on the business need. You have to be talking their language.</p>\n\n<p>Third they may have money in the budget they need to spend or they won't get it next year.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, they may agree with your solution but know it is an easier sell to senior management if it comes from an outside source. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to contribute to change at your organization, you need to first start helping the consultants. It will be noticed that you have contributed if you do this.  Pay attention to how they present the results versus how you did it. Learn how to present ideas like a successful consultant.  </p>\n\n<p>Next don't assume that the people making the decisions are even aware of your skills. Likely anyone beyond your immediate boss doesn't know you already have the skills they are looking for. I've even had bosses who did not know my background if they were not the person who originally hired me and the task was outside the normal duties I did for them. (But if I wanted them to use those skills, I made sure to make sure they knew.) You need to become visible to the higher levels of the organization, see this question for more on this subject:\n<a href=\"https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/11816/why-is-it-important-to-gain-visibility-in-the-workplace\">Why is it important to gain &quot;visibility&quot; in the workplace?</a> </p>\n\n<p>You should welcome the consultants because every time they make the same recommendation you did, then your credibility is increased.</p>\n",
            " <p>Serious problems rarely have one solution nor are they always solved to a specific degree. There is some gray area. Like all engineers, you want to solve problems (which is good), but managers also have to factor in risk.</p>\n\n<p>Consultants can mitigate risk:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>They were highly recommended (i.e. it's not my fault if they screw up)</li>\n<li>They can be contractually held to providing solutions or payment can be withheld where as employees just get fired.</li>\n<li>Consultants can have access to other types of expertise if something unexpected comes up.</li>\n<li>Current Staff may have expertise, but not the time to implement a solution.</li>\n<li>Some managers have previous experience with a particular consultant, so they feel more comfortable with that person. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(Per update to the question) It is safe to assume that people who lack knowledge in an area struggle to identify those who can. It seems like you're able to put together a detailed proposal, but management may be more comfortable if you just get to the point.</p>\n",
            " <p>The empirical evidence says that when you know a good solution you are unable to build group consensus that it is the best way forward. Unless you consistently work for, and with, incompetent people, then the balance of probabilities is that the problem is in your soft skills, specifically with consensus building. This may be a case of Dunning-Kruger but where you are over-estimating your skills in the area of teamwork, consensus building, and stakeholder management. </p>\n\n<p>You state that \"instead of being trusted to solve the issue\" they hire in a consultant. No-one is infallible so taking something on trust is taking a risk. If there is significant potential downside it would be irrational not to minimise risk. It is trivial to eliminate the risk of taking what you say on trust; get a consultant in for a second opinion. A lack of \"soft skills\" and an over focus on the technical aspects of problem solving may be driving them into hiring consultants. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=EQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">high EQ</a> approach is:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Don't bring <em>your</em> solution to the group; bring the group to <em>their</em> solution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Parachuting a solution into a group of stakeholders always risks rejection. People will not have thought through all the avenues you have thought through. They cannot feel comfortable that all the possible alternatives are inferior. The high EQ approach is to talk the solution space over with some key stakeholders one-to-one in advance of any group meetings. This refines your argument and builds support for your recommendations. Go over some possible approaches you have rejected asking whether your rejection reasoning is sound. Then present your favoured solution asking if you have missed any angles, risks or issues. Finally ask them if they can think of any good alternative approaches. Repeat this with a few stakeholders one-to-one until you are sure you have all the angles covered and have perfected your pitch. </p>\n\n<p>Only then hold a group meeting with all stakeholders and take the same approach; go through the alternatives which have been rejected and why. Then pitch your favoured solution and perhaps an alternative someone else has come up with to show you are being open minded and balanced. </p>\n\n<p>Taking such a consensus building approach works for many reasons: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>People feel you have listened and have a fully rounded perspective on all risk and issues.  </li>\n<li>People understand the alternative ideas you have considered and why\nthey are rejected.</li>\n<li>You learn new things about risks and issues of alternative solutions.</li>\n<li>You learn which risks and issues stakeholders are more or less concerned about.   </li>\n<li>Some people you have consulted feel vested in your preferred solution because you have taken time to go over it with them.  </li>\n<li>Some people get more time to consider your solution on two encounters; once when you go over it with them directly and a second time when you bring it to the wider group. If your solution is superior to the alternatives they are likely to be convinced that it is the best way forward. </li>\n<li>You can present the solution as being a group solution by saying things like \"Mary pointed out that X could go wrong which we can cover by doing Y\". </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=EQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Googling \"EQ\"</a> brings up: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For most people, emotional intelligence (EQ) is more important than\n  one's intelligence (IQ) in attaining success in their lives and\n  careers. As individuals our success and the success of the profession\n  today depend on our ability to read other people's signals and react\n  appropriately to them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You should read that people are not persuaded by your approach and are unwilling to simply trust you. The appropriate reaction is to engage with people, learn their concerns, help them to refine the solution, and pitch the solution as owned by the team, not by you. </p>\n",
            " <p>I think you might be missing another aspect of the cost-benefit equation here.</p>\n\n<p>There are quite a few reasons to hire consultants, and one of those is to simply allow for the internal staff to be able to focus on the day to day running of the environment.<br>\nI've come into quite a few shops where the staff knew what the problem was, and had a pretty good idea of the cause or even a solution already planned.</p>\n\n<p>Going into these environments, my main impression is usually that I'm being asked for a plan not because they don't have one, but because <em>they want to compare it with the plan already provided by their internal staff to gauge my competence</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The internal staff is usually required for day to day workings, and are the first stop whenever a problem occurs. While the issue I'm brought in to fix is something that, while often time consuming, is not a recurring action. And as such can easily be handled by an external asset who can be safely let go once the job is done.</p>\n\n<p>Have you actually asked your boss(es) why they prefer hiring consultants for these issues in stead of going with your recommendations?<br>\nIf they are competent managers, the answer might surprise you, and have less to do with their perceived competence of your skills than you think.</p>\n",
            " <p>Catalogue all the times this has happened, get estimates for how much was spent on consultants to come up with solutions (as opposed to implementing them), then go as high as you can in the organisation and ask for a pay raise.</p>\n\n<p>The obvious rule of thumb being used here is \"more expense = more excellence\". If they're paying you more, they'll take you more seriously.</p>\n"

        "sft_target": " <p>The best way to prevent the race for a consultant is present a convincing business case that doesn't include a consultant.  From the business cases I've developed the main points are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Thoroughly define the problem being solved - Do not include your solution within the problem definition.  Concisely state the problem in business terms rather than technical terms.  For example \"Based on submitted bug reports customers find feature X confusing.  This confusion leads to frustration and reduces engagement in the overall product.\" is much better than \"The UI of feature X is flawed in these ways...\" because it states the problem in terms of business value.  In terms of solution ownership this shows that you understand the issue from a business perspective which is key since this is the same perspective that the decision makers will be looking from.  This will get everyone on the same page as to what the problem is from a high level.</li>\n<li>State your solution along with several other possible plans of\naction including the null case of doing nothing and state the\ncosts/benefits for each. For the above example I would go through\ndoing nothing, scrapping feature X, improving user training/help\ndocuments, reworking the UI on feature X.  This shows that you have\nlooked at the issue from several sides rather than immediately\nhopping onto your pet solution to the exclusion of all others.</li>\n<li>Show how you can effectively test if your solution eliminates the\nproblem.  This is huge in selling non-technical people on technical\nsolutions.  They want assurance that their investment is working so\nif you can give them concrete parameters and a way to measure\nsuccess.  If the definition of success is murky it is\npsychologically much harder to buy in to an idea.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My best real world example regarding going to a consultant is imagine you go to a mechanic for routine inspection.  If you hear \"Your garbles are cracked.  It's $800 to change them out.  Should I go ahead with that?\"  you are not going to be very confident in your ability to know if your money is being well spent and you may get a second opinion.  If you hear \"Your garbles are slightly cracked which could lead to your steering failing if you hit a pothole.  We could wait and see but that's risky.  I could weld across the crack for $500 but I wouldn't trust it long run.  It would be $800 to swap them out.  Swapping them out is the only way we can be sure they will hold.  What do you want me to do?\" you are going to feel more empowered to make a good decision even if the ultimate decision is the same.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note in a lot of places you are going to be fighting the culture to make headway on this.  Don't take it personally if the default answer is consultancy, just continue to work on your sales skills for selling your ideas to management.  When a decision goes against you on this remember that you may be missing pieces of the bigger picture (ie cost of failure may be higher than it generally appears due to interdependencies) or the opportunity cost for you doing this project rather than something else might be too high.</p>\n",
        "rejected_target": " <p>I've seen the same type of issue in my own past.  As noted by Myles part of the issue might be a communication problem. Often, people will not necessarily understand a technical person's description of a problem or the appropriate solution. Graphs, pictures and external supporting references sometimes confer some comfort to the reader.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of your communication skills I suggest there is a very difficult to overcome reason for such behavior as a company grows. Higher level people who are making decisions often abhor making a decision that they can be held directly accountable for. If they take a risk on a solution you propose and it doesn't work out they either stumble themselves or a strong internal resource stumbles.</p>\n\n<p>Neither is acceptable to some people.</p>\n\n<p>When a brand name consultant comes along, which of course appears to represent expertise, which at times is simply not any more advanced than internal resources, there is a nice convenient place to put the blame. I went with what the consultants proposed and so did the rest of the stakeholders involved. It came in a flashy document with loads of details which must mean it was correct.</p>\n\n<p>So, yes, if there's a problem we fire the consultant. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not a fan of this but I have seen the reins handed over to bumbling consulting and development groups too many times to discount this effect. Now, there are other good reasons, such as not having the time and resources to tackle the issue internally -- or quite simply not having a large enough team with solid skills in the area being considered even though one or two folks may.</p>\n\n<p>My viewpoint may be peppered with a touch of jaded... ;)</p>\n"
