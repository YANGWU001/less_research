I have passed every requirement throughout my graduate career, but as it stands my adviser (P.I.) is unwilling to discuss anything graduation.  I have met with the dean and she was as unhelpful and non-committal as one could expect from someone in her position.  At this point I don't care about a letter of rec. or keeping any form of a relationship with my adviser.  All I wan't is that stupid piece of paper that says I have my PhD.  I have tried discussing things with my adviser and it turned into a verbal assault in which I stood their and was called horrible names for bringing the subject up (this doesn't begin to describe the level of abuse that my adviser exhibits over myself and other students).  I am most certainly not alone, there are three other students in my lab that are my year and going through the same experiences.    What I am really asking is does anyone know of a process by which I can force my graduation.  Whether it is petitioning or speaking to a certain representative.  The dean that I spoke with said that the only way for me to graduate is with my advisers signature, but I cannot believe that the university does not have a fail safe to protect its students from sociopath professors.  Especially considering I have passed every bench mark asked of me (besides my thesis defense of course).    Any help would be appreciated.\n\nAssistant:"

Hi everyone,  I am a current postgraduate psychology student, and I am training to become a psychologist. I am looking for the perspectives of academics.  I have a complex medical history, and I take multiple medications to manage my health. The university are aware of this. In 2015, the police caught me at the airport in Australia headed for the UK with opioids. I had a prescription, but it wasn't on me. They charged me with unlawful possession of a controlled substance. I went to court with a lawyer, and the charge was withdrawn.  When I applied to become a provisional psychologist, my application was significantly delayed because I had to declare my medical history, incase it was considered an 'impairment'. They were not, however, concerned by my criminal history once they understood the circumstances. I am now a registered provisional psychologist.  I also applied for a Working With Children Check in October last year. They wrote to me and asked me to explain the charges. They said I had no proof that I had a prescription, so they were going to reject my application, but my lawyer and I decided to hire a forensic psychiatrist. He wrote to them, and said I am no risk to children, and I sometimes take opioids to manage severe pain, but I am not addicted to opioids. We sent the report in July, and have not heard from them since.  The university have forgotten about the WWCC, and have organised a placement as a provisional psychologist. I contacted my lawyer, and she said it is illegal for me to commence the placement. WWCC are not answerable to anyone, and are unwilling to provide a timeline.  I think I need to tell the university, but I am nervous. I am worried they will think I am addicted to opioids. I am worried they will think I am lying about my criminal history - because, really, how are opioids related to working with children? I am also worried they will think the reason my registration took so long to process was because of my history. Ultimately, I am worried I will lose my place in the course.  What are your thoughts? What should I do?  Many thanks in advance.\n\nAssistant:"

Fast forward to today, I have already accepted a TT position and suddenly find myself on the other side of the table -- recruiting students, planning for independent grant applications, etc., which are all very new to me. So, I come back here with a few questions on grad student recruitment:  1) How do you attract grad students to work with you as a new PI? This year is particularly tricky for me because I am not listed on the department's website and do not yet have a functioning lab. I see a few good applicants whose research interests overlap with mine, but they applied to work with other professors in the department. My future colleagues are okay with them working with me. In this case, do you have any suggestions on how I should reach out to the applicants and present myself as a potential alternative advisor?  2) I understand that students are still learning (so am I!) and may face challenges in their lives, and it is my job to support them and help them grow. However, I have also heard some bad stories from my colleagues about their students/trainees. (By \"bad stories,\" I am not talking about regular difficulties but the more extreme cases, like academic dishonesty, toxic personality, and extreme procrastination/stubbornness that significantly delays project progress, which can be detrimental to a new lab.) So, in your experience, at the stage of reviewing applications/interviewing applicants, what are the ways to identify red flags/potentials of the student? Thank you!\n\nAssistant:"

What I've been able to read of the book demonstrates the same problems.  As a white archaeologist, I can only speak with authority on the archaeological knowledge side of things. So, I suggest you read this post first. This quote from the writer summarizes it well:  > contradictions that result from differing details related through stories are often reconciled simply by letting them be. For Indigenous peoples, trying to choose a narrative as being \"true\" or \"correct\" over another isn't necessarily an issue - nor is it considered the \"right\" thing to do. They are seen as mutually existing and overlapping where they do, but parting where they may.  The origins of humans in the Americas are one such story.  You'll find that indigenous groups and archaeologists agree on one thing: humans have been here a very, very long time. So long, in fact, that conceptualizing indigenous Americans as having \"arrived\" to the continents is not helpful unless the question is specifically about those early migrations. For all the intents and purposes of 99.99% of social scientists, indigenous Americans have always been here.  Issues arise when people attempt to classify \"very, very long time.\" Archaeological knowledge relies on material evidence, which is used to give the all-important Number of Years Ago when humans first settled in a region. That number can be at odds with indigenous understandings of the past, which derive from a different epistemology and make very different types of claims   Steeves presents a simple solution: latent bias and anti-Indigenous sentiment have prevented archaeologists from recognizing archaeological sites of great antiquity in the Americas.  Does that sound like a contradiction of the above point? To me, at least, it does.  Steeves excels as a historian of American archaeology and as an advocate for indigenous perspectives in academia. Thus, the first half of the book (what I've been able to read of it) is quite good, even if it doesn't break new ground. And then she gets into the archaeology of it all... and things fall apart.   For one, it presents very little new material. If you have kept up at all with American archaeology, you will have seen the sites she discusses before. And if you have not yet been convinced that the Cerrutti Mastodon site is anthropogenic, Steeves won't be the one to do it. Numbers beyond 80kya aren't usually rejected because of anything particular to American archaeology, but because they precede the emigration of modern human lineages from Africa. Steeves presents sites like Pedra Furada, excavated by Niede \"occupation-of-the-Americas-could-go-back-100,000-years-and-the-first-settlers-'might-have-come-not-overland-from-Asia-but-by-boat-from-Africa\" Guidon, are presented as certain fact. It's indiscriminate and uncritical.  At the same time, the parts I've read do not engage well with current discussions of human presence in the Americas. Clovis-first is quite decidedly dead for all but the most stubborn defenders, and has been for at least two decades. Discussing refusal to acknowledge pre-Clovis sites as a contemporary issue, rather than in a historical overview, feels inappropriate in 2021. The introductory preview for the book attacks the word \"Caucausoid\" as if any American archaeologist has said that word in the current century.  It's difficult to look at Steeves's critiques and then look at the response (in my circles at least) to the footprints found recently in New Mexico and feel like it's the same group of people. It's not clear at many points if she's critiquing archaeologists, how archaeology gets taught, or popular archaeology.   Much of what I can about this book I have said in more detail regarding *Lies My Teacher Told Me* by James Loewen. Both books feel preoccupied with the way some Truth or Real History has been erased by American nationalism/imperialism. Both books are also outrageously indiscriminate with the evidence they use to support alternate narratives. Having (correctly) established that bias can pervade academic inquiry, they proceed to treat every single dismissal of \"inconvenient\" findings as purely ideological.   Steeves offers an important and necessary critique. American anthropologists have historically overlooked, discredited, ignored, and actively attacked indigenous perspectives. They continue to do so. Yet Steeves seems to believe that there is a single Truth about human origins in the Americas and that archaeological and indigenous knowledges must be reconciled to discover it. This is rather inconsistent with the approaches outlined by those quoted/cited in the first link I provided. Different forms of knowledge *will* contradict each other, and it's more productive to let them be and learn from the overlap. It's almost as if she is looking to the archaeological record to find material evidence to \"prove\" oral histories, even though those histories are not meant to be \"proven.\"  **TL;DR** The archaeology in the book is bad. Steeves's portrayal of indigenous knowledge, in that it must temper archaeology so that it may more close resemble some Absolute Truth, is not in line with the way other indigenous scholars have addressed the (non-)issue of competing knowledge claims."

You sometimes hear accounts of sailors, missionaries, anthropologists and such who go to live among people  with entirely foreign languages. If there is no common language how long is it likely to take to learn. I recall hearing about a guy by the name of Jack Renton who was a castaway who lived among the Lau at first as a slave but later marrying into them. By the end he apparently knew their language well. Is there any research or accounts on how long this process might take in such a situation where there is no common tongue and what it involves that you could direct me to?.

                "content": " Awesome, something I'm semi-qualified to talk about.  In a case of full immersion where you are totally cut off from your native language, you will start to have the basics in a few weeks, be minimally conversant in around a month and should be able to hold a decent conversation in 6-8 weeks.  Fluency will depend on your commitment, willingness to study and natural ability but will come in around 4 months to a year, assuming sustained no contact with people who speak a language you speak.   ANY contact, even extremely limited (5-10 minutes a day) with a language you speak will delay this schedule. This is because humans are social creatures with an intense desire to communicate, and so in a case of total immersion in a foreign language, that intense need to communicate will highly motivate you to learn. Satisifying that need even a little with your native language (or any language you speak well) will reduce the visceral need to learn the new language, having a huge impact on progress.   Strategies to accelerate acquiring a language include:  - Learn the 100 most common words in a language. Memorize them, make sure you recognize them when spoken and as quickly as possible, learn to use them including their conjugations. Even better if you do this before arriving.   - Learn a semi-complex sentence like, \"I need groceries, so I am going to to the store to buy milk and bread.\" Get a native speaker to help you develop this single sentence into every possible form. Switch the tenses, switch \"I\" to \"you, he, she, they, it\", formal and informal etc. Memorize these forms to build a basic familiarity with the grammar. Refer back to this early on.   - Spend as much time around children as possible. This is a big one for two reasons. One, kids tend to talk about the here and now,  basic needs and desires and their immediate environment more, generally speak about simple things and thus help you build the basics faster. But actually more important, kids will laugh at you when you make mistakes, and if you ask kids to correct you, they will. Adults will instinctively ignore your mistakes as long as they understand you. (One of the reasons kids learn language so fast is because other kids are better natural teachers.)  - Play games that involve speaking with native speakers as much as they'll let you. Card games, board games, dice or domino/tile games etc. Any game that involves lots of socializing and conversation. (The super bonus ultra secret level is role playing games. If you can find a D&D group in that language to play with, you'll be completely fluent and even reading in 3-4 months or less. I'm not exaggerating here at all.)  - Socialize, preferably with alcohol, especially in weeks 3-6. There is a natural phase of language learning that comes as you've started to comprehend well enough to understand a good chunk of what you hear, but it can be hard to start to form sentences. Language teachers often call this \"the silent period\" (and it's worse for shy people). Getting past this and starting to try to speak really helps you learn, and so relaxing (or lowering your inhibitions with a few drinks) can really help you break through this phase.   - Finally, and obviously, in the first month or two, do absolutely everything possible to avoid any languages you speak. This includes reading, radio, movies etc. You will start to crave hearing a language you understand. Don't give in, nothing will fuel your development faster than the need to communicate."

Names beginning in *W*-, which isn't used in Portuguese at all except in borrowings, are particularly popular, as are names ending in -*son*, both of which appear to be in vogue since they make names appear English (alternately, both *Nelson* and *Wellington* have been popular Portuguese names since the Napoleonic wars, so this may play into it as well). Compare how some African American names run the gamut of actual African names (e.g. *Jamal*) to invented but \"African sounding\" names: Brazilian first names include actual English first names (*Wilmer*), repurposed English surnames (*Davidson*, *Washington*), respelled English surnames (*Deividson*), invented English-sounding names, some of which are quite popular (*Edilson*) and entirely unique names (*D'Jane*). This phenomenon isn't restricted to purely English-sounding names, although that's the stereotype. I've met many Brazilians with unusual first names of no obvious origin, but Brazil is diverse enough that it's not always clear whether a name is invented, native, or passed down through immigration."

In other words, if there's a positive, there must be a negative as well, right?  Such reasoning, though, usually implies a misunderstanding of the role(s) of those norms within a society, and the way that a society works in the first place.  When we look at other social species-- not even just mammalian, but even insects-- what we see is that in *all* of these social species, various rules exist governing sex, sexual access, rights / permissions, etc. Sex is, after all, a fundamental part of biological existence. It's what allows species to propagate themselves. And in order for that propagation to result in viable offspring, the development of various behavioral rules was favored. Not every member of a society has or can have sexual access to every other *potential* mate. You simply can't allow that kind of free-for-all, because competition for mates-- and sexual selection-- are two major factors that contribute to adaptive change.  Behavioral norms regarding sex are part of what allow animal societies to continue to function. We can see this kind of behavior among all of our close animal kin (great apes and other primates, for example). We see it in bees. We see it in... as I said, practically every social animal species.  Humans are somewhat unusual among animals (but not unique) in that we can and do engage in sex for other reasons besides pure procreation. Pair bonding, recreation, etc. But in the end, we still are social animals, and a functional society requires certain norms of behavior-- guidelines, taboos, etc.-- governing what is, at its most basic, a fundamental biological process by which we propagate our species. For most of our existence, sex has had the likely potential outcome of offspring. And since producing viable and competitive offspring constitutes a significant survival advantage, various norms (biological and social) regarding mate selection, access, and restriction have been strongly selected.  Coming back to my opening sentences... the existence of a positive (rules governing sexual behavior) might seem to imply the potential for the existence of a negative (no such rules). But simply put, it's not possible to have a functional society under such circumstances.  **edit:** It's worth noting that attempts to establish so-called \"free sex\" societies have generally resulted in the fairly rapid establishment of rules governing who does and does not have access."

According to Harris 1989, in classical Athens the literacy rate was probably 5-10 %, and the Roman empire at its zenith did not have a higher rate than around 10 %. It's hard to estimate literacy in the first writing cultures, but de Mieroop 2016 notes that in the Ur III (~2K BC) period, it was remarkable that even small villages had people who could read and write. It may have been on a comparable level as elite cities in the later classical era. In some states literacy was a closely guarded secret. The Maya elite, for example, deliberately kept literacy to itself.   Everywhere else it would have been lower, and in many regions it would have been zero since there was no writing.   Literacy had a very short time to be chosen for by evolution. It is conceivable that in elite families that were expected to be literate, dyslexia could have been selected against, but for the vast majority of the population, that would have been an invisible and unknown disorder.  Evolution is unlikely to be very important to whether you were literate or not in the pre-modern era. It was almost exclusively a question of what family you were born into.

Trying to plan out Thanksgiving turkey and have come across 2 methods that claim to make better turkey than roasting it whole. Spatchcocking and Roasting in Pieces.   Now I almost never work with whole poultry. My experience is usually with pre-cut pieces like thighs, drums, and breasts. That being said, I agree that these 2 methods seem better than roasting the whole bird. But Thanksgiving can be hectic enough and I cook it solo, so the less chaos/unpredictability the better.  What method would you say is easier, spatchcocking and cooking in pieces? Both involve some initial cutting of the raw turkey and I dunno which is better as a starting spot for an amateur cook.  Far as I can see, the advantage to spatchcocking is that the bird remains as one cohesive thermal unit so it roasts evenly; and that you can do it at one time with one uniform temperature for the whole bird. The downsides to spatchcocking seem to be cutting out the backbone - not sure if my kitchen shears are sharp enough, they might be but I've never tested it out. Also when you pull the bird out at 150F internal breast temp, the leg meat remains kinda pink even after resting. I know it's cooked and safe to eat, but my family will freak out at pink poultry meat and claim it's uncooked. We've gone to war over pork meat like this and it's ruined more than one meal in the past.  For roasting in pieces, the upsides seem to be that I can more precisely control the internal temps of the turkey pieces to be exact for each part of the bird (nobody screaming at me over pink meat). The problem is that it requires even more initial carving than spatchcocking, and although I know my knife is sharp enough to make those cuts, I have little experience carving whole turkey. Additionally I would guess that the dark meat and white meat need to be cooked at different oven temperatures for optimal results and thus finish at different times, so I need a good way to keep one warm while the other cooks.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanksgiving is maybe my favorite holiday and I've recently gotten into cooking, so I want to do as good a job as I can.\n\nAssistant:"

How To Make The Best Homemade Vanilla Extract Full credit to Kimberly Killebrew on daringgourmet.com  https://www.daringgourmet.com/make-best-homemade-vanilla-extract/#wprm-recipe-container-43930  Ingredients  Grade B Madagascar bourbon vanilla beans\u00a0(grade B is specifically meant for extracting but if you have grade A those will also work)  Vodka\u00a080 proof (vodka has the most neutral flavor but you can also use bourbon, brandy, or even rum as long as it's 80 proof)  2 ounce brown glass jars  4 ounce brown glass jars  Metal funnel for pouring  For single-fold vanilla extract\u00a0like the kind you find in most stores: Use .8 ounces (or 22 grams) of vanilla beans per 1 cup of vodka  For double-fold vanilla extract\u00a0much stronger flavor and many professional bakers prefer it: Use 1.6 ounces (or 44 grams) of vanilla beans per 1 cup of vodka)  Instructions  Cut the vanilla beans in half lengthwise and scrape out the vanilla flecks inside. Add the flecks and the beans to the vodka in a glass jar with a fitted lid. Place the extract in a dark, cool place, shaking occasionally. The extract can be used in as little as 8 weeks for gets better and better with age. For far better results use after 6 months and for optimal results wait a year.  Once the extract is ready, place the funnel on the glass jars and fill them with the extract. Slice the vanilla beans to fit the length of the jars and place about 2 pieces in the 2-ounce jars and 4 pieces in the 4-ounce jars. That way the extract will continue to \"ripen\" as it sits.  Notes  One of the most important factors that determines the quality of the outcome is how long you allow the vanilla extract to age. While you can use it in as little as 8 weeks the flavor becomes vastly superior the longer it ages. For better results wait 6 months, for best results wait a year. I make a large batch every year to use the following year, that way I always have 12-month aged vanilla on hand. __________________ Let's be honest, why would you go through the effort of making it yourself if you didn't want fantastic results? WAIT THE FULL YEAR."

NETs+Syndrome.  I realize this might be against the rules since it is not a question but I felt I should share. Sorry mods if this is not acceptable and remove if necessary. ______  Several years back I made a few posts on r/AskDocs aka \"Ask A Doctor\" looking for help with symptoms that had been getting progressively worse for a few years. They were quite detailed and each time I got a little bit of basic advice and suggestions but nothing that helped resolve or figure out the issues. I delayed going to a doctor and then even when I did, I downplayed the symptoms.  I deleted most of the posts for privacy reasons after advice was sought and received but the last one I posted remains (it got no responses and was specifically about flushing and did not contain some of the other symptoms so I didn't think to delete it)...   https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/69w3ai/flushing_tingling_of_face_and_body_help_please/  It is not the best representation of the help I was seeking but I figured I would link it.  ____  I finally sought help from a specialist a few months after that and after plenty of testing and multiple referrals, I was diagnosed with Stage IV Neuroendocrine cancer and Severe Carcinoid Syndrome. It was bad enough progressed that I was told by the doctor team and surgeons who initially treated me after the diagnosis, that they were shocked at my condition and were surprised I had not had either a heart attack or liver failure yet. One doctor even stated that if I had kept going without seeking help I would have been dead within 6 months for sure.  While the situation is far from resolved (I have gone through multiple surgeries and treatments since) and while there is no cure or resolution currently, I am now way better off than I was before and am a research patient contributing to cancer research for young Neuroendocrine patients. I may be dealing with this the rest of my life but I am alive and contributing to research that may help others.  ____  I post this because I want to make it clear that /r/AskDocs is great as a sounding board and to get general advice but it is no substitute for actually seeing doctors and pushing for help. One of my first posts someone stated that I should push my doctors on the matter if I was that concerned. I wish I had done exactly that sooner. Instead, I kept seeking advice on r/AskDocs, and downplaying my situation in the real world.  I read a lot of posts on this subreddit and often see people seemingly dismissing going to an actual doctor or stating they don't think it is helpful and expecting the subreddit to figure out their problem. If you do not trust your doctor find a new one, but please folks, SEE A REAL DOCTOR FOR YOUR ISSUES. And PLEASE communicate fully and don't downplay things. This subreddit may help you get ideas for questions, and maybe even find possible solutions, but it is NOT a substitute for a real doctor.   Take my case as an example. I delayed and delayed, and kept posting on this subreddit hoping for answers and while I did see real doctors, I did not push my situation or give as much detail as I should have. I downplayed it and figured that if no one on /r/AskDocs seemed to know what it was, it probably was not serious.  How wrong I was.\n\nAssistant:"

I don't know what to do. Good morning and thank you for any replies in advance. Basic medical info is below.  25F, 5'0\", 120lb, half Japanese/half white, located in Philadelphia, less than a pack a day smoker, I use medical marijuana, never drink. Existing conditions are idiopathic hypersomnia, depression, anxiety, c-ptsd, and Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease. Current medications: trintellix 10mg, lamotrigine 100mg, vyvanse 60mg. I also just had two 5-ish hour IVIG infusions last week.   I was diagnosed with Kikuchi Fujimoto disease in December 2020 after being sick since February 2020. I had gone through many specialists and finally got a 2nd opinion  and diagnosis from a whole team of specialists at Penn. I am currently treated there in the oncology department.   This disease is apparently pretty rare, and usually sorts itself out within 6 months. Unfortunately I did not get better on my own and thus have been feeling sick for a year now. My symptoms are swollen lymph nodes, drenching night sweats, nausea/vomiting, a plaquey rash on my back, weird blood work, really bad fatigue, abdominal pain, weight loss, and I run a low grade fever every day. I did a month of a really high prednisone taper, as soon as I stopped all my symptoms came back. I did two long IVIG infusions in the hospital last week but so far I haven't noticed any improvement. My doctor told me that he has seen a few patients with this before and has had success with an infusion called Rituxan, but as of now my insurance is denying it and its far too expensive to tackle out of pocket. The reason the insurance is denying the rituxan is because this disease is so rare there's very little literature or research on treatment already.  I trust my doctor and I have faith that their team is doing all they can for me in terms of care and also trying to get me the Rituxan for free. I feel unwell most of the time and while I think I've done a pretty good job of keeping it together for the last year, It's starting to become a struggle to keep going. I can't find a single other human who can relate to what I've gone through. I almost feel like an imposter because I'm treated in the oncology department because what I have is cancer like, but not cancer. A stupid part of me is afraid I'm taking time and resources away from cancer patients during a global pandemic and maybe I should just be suffering and hope eventually my symptoms resolve. My thoughts are veering to a dark place. I am not afraid to die but I am afraid to live like this, constantly feeling ill. I sent a message to my care team this morning asking if there's some kind of special therapist who deals with rare diseases or difficult diagnoses but I haven't heard back just yet. I have a therapist who I speak to every other week, but I want to talk to someone who deals with this more often.  How can I find someone, a patient or a counselor, who can relate to me? I can't find online forums for Kikuchi Fujimoto disease. Is a rare disease counselor even a thing? Have you had patients with super rare conditions? How did they cope? I always put on a happy face when I go to Penn because everyone there is always so nice to me, should I be more open about my despair?   Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.\n\nAssistant:"

This is really just a question I never thought to bring here until right now, when my phone decided a news byte I needed was someone growing hair out of their gums.  Which reminded me of something that happened ages ago that I've never found an answer for.  When I was a kid, a hair fucking grew out of my tongue.  Towards the back, too far for me to really reach.  I discovered it when it got tugged by my back teeth.  Screamed my head off; still remember how much it hurt.  My grandparents were watching me at the time and they were just like \"...what the fuck is this child's damage?\"  I reached far back enough to try and feel around, and the end broke off (you know how it does when you use tweezers, and you don't get the root, but the hair breaks off?) just a bit, but enough to confirm that yes, this was a hair.  However, I realized that convincing people that there was a hair growing out of my fucking tongue was going to be an uphill battle, so I resolved to deal with it.  I have no memory of what happened after that, but I assume it didn't bother me again because I surely would've lost my resolve if it had; the pain was intense.  I also remember the explanation I came up with as a kid: I must have eaten something that cut my tongue and somehow it scabbed over and trapped a hair I'd accidentally gotten in my mouth.  In hindsight that seems only slightly more likely than a hair actually growing out of my tongue, but it was far less terrifying, so I went with it.  Except it happened again.  Not sure if it was when I was a teen or a young adult; old enough to take the pain of it without losing my shit, but long enough ago that I can't place it on any sort of timeline.  Same thing happened; enough of the end broke off that it stopped getting snagged and never bothered me again.  Honestly?  While I always remembered it, I'd assumed for a while that it was just one of those weird kid memories you eventually realize didn't actually happen.  Sure I could remember it clearly but I can also clearly remember things I know I'm not remembering correctly.  And hair just...doesn't grow out of the back of someone's tongue.  But the second time I was well past the age for that.  No matter how much I google, I only get results for the disgusting but irrelevant condition colloquially known as \"hairy tongue.\"  And one site that claims to have medical photos of hair growing out of tongues, but one looks photoshopped and the other one looks like a dog with stitches in its tongue.  And a lot of dream interpretation sites. I'm fully expecting any responses I get to accuse me of making shit up (to what end, I don't know) or misremembering, and I get it.  I'm just hoping someone here will say \"Oh I heard of that happening to a guy\" or whatever.   Hell, at this point I'll take \"Sometimes people with X disorder have vivid hallucinations of hair growing out of their tongue.\"    This has been bothering me for 30 years.\n\nAssistant:"

So my question is, is this likely a short temporary policy while they try to confirm the cases/ isolate them and will be over soon...or is this likely to be a weeks long thing?"

I was really sick with a bad cough so I went to the doctor to get checked out. They wanted to see if it was pneumonia so they took me to take an x-ray. I\u2019ve had x-rays on my chest many times before so I knew I had to take off my bra. That alone makes me really uncomfortable, but I\u2019ve always pushed through for this purpose. For context I HATE my body showing. I panic at the thought of people seeing me nude, and yes, it does get in the way of medical exams. This particular time when I was getting an x-ray, after I had taken my bra off from under my shirt they wanted me to take off my shirt as well though. That\u2019s never happened before. (It was just a basic graphic tee. I\u2019m almost positive I\u2019ve worn that same shirt before for an x-ray) They wanted me to stand in this room naked from the waist up. It was a male nurse, which was hard enough, but honestly it wouldn\u2019t have mattered for me if they were female. I said \u201cI don\u2019t have metal or anything on my shirt. I\u2019ve never had to take it off before\u201d but I was already panicking and kind of shutting down. My response to things that make me uncomfortable is to freeze. He just repeated \u201ctake off your shirt.\u201d And he started walking over to me. My arms were crossed over my chest and he reached down, grabbed the bottom of my shirt and forced it off of me. I was hyperventilating at this point and crying very obviously, but he just told me to move over to the x-ray board. I did what he asked and let him move me in the position he needed me in, but I hated every moment. At one point he said \u201cStop crying. You\u2019re okay\u201d in a very annoyed voice and he kept looking at me like he was irritated. Even rolled his eyes numerous times like I was being completely unreasonable of a patient. This happened a little over a year ago and it still effects me. Like I\u2019m shaking just typing this out. Especially going to doctors now. Thankfully there is no way for me to ever go back to that clinic as I don\u2019t live there anymore.\n\nAssistant:"

Bit of a heavy one here, but I NEED advice. (Also sorry for the spelling and grammar I\u2019m not the smartest when it comes to that stuff.)  So on the first of December I gave birth to the most beautiful baby girl. She weighed 6lbs 2oz and was the picture of health and happiness. Everything was going perfect until the end of her first week of life , I looked down at her and she was red and wide eyed and flopping her head around in distress... I realised she was choking, I scooped her up and when she was up right and had a few sharp blast to the back vomit started to come out of her nose and mouth, she started crying when the vomit started gushing so I knew that she could breath again. Now this whole incident only last in total 5-8 seconds, but it really shook me. After she was better I was so relieved but I was immediately worried it was going to happen again so I asked my partner/ mum/ partners mum and dad/ friends who are parents / doctors/ midwife/ health visitor and they all pretty much told me it would be fine and she would have cleared it herself if had of been asleep or not watching her because \u2018that\u2019s how babies are designed \u2018 , but they didn\u2019t see it , they didn\u2019t see the fear in her eyes and how she was acting. It was honestly so frustrating to not be listened to or taken seriously about this of all things. Nevertheless even though it went against what I believed, I listened to them and settled myself and made myself chalk it down as a freak accident and told myself that she would have been fine if I hadn\u2019t of helped her.  Fast forward to Christmas Eve and me and my partner where just about to go to sleep, I was actually already drifting off and he screams she not breathing, it was happening again but this time it was way worse , she was wide eyed again and flopping about in distress but this time when she was sat up and patted on the back nothing was happening and she started moving a lot less and her eyes closed, she was starting to turn purple, basically she was about to choke to death. Thankfully after the last time I watched some infant first aid videos, so i asked my partner to hold her head down and I opened her mouth and stuck my finger in and hooked the thick liquid stuff that was in the throat and started pulling it out, she let of one little tiny cry so I knew it was working to some degree so I ran into the kitchen and got the mucus sucker and with one hand used it on her nose and the other hand to hook the stuff out of her throat again . Finally she cried a few times and began to breath and even though she was foaming at the mouth and very weak I could tell she was atleast breathing again , this whole incident last 40 seconds. Once we got her breathing again we called an ambulance, they took her in to hospital and observed her for a while and advised on some changes in food (both the amount and type) and said she should be fine.  Now here\u2019s my problem, everyone said she was fine the first time too, but clearly it happened again and to a much worse degree!  Now me and my partner are taking full shifts so she is always with someone who is awake and fully alert, which is fine but I can\u2019t relax, I spent eight hours solidly just staring at her watching her breathing and panicking every time she moved or made a noise. I genuinely don\u2019t know how I am meant to cope with this fear that she is going to die any second, I can\u2019t enjoy any time with her because I\u2019m so stressed even though I want to be able to enjoy being with her I just can\u2019t over the past few days. I don\u2019t know what to do , does anybody have advice or has anyone been through similar experience?\n\nAssistant:"

He is slightly obese but in a healthy way.   When he first got sick he was at home and really puffed up and coughing. Other than that he was in good spirits. After about 4-5 days he was admitted to a hospital where they don't have ventilation but oxygen tanks and he has been declining in health there.  His first xray indicated that 1/4 of his right lung was killed off or white and today (about 3 days after admission) we recieved news that he's at 30% lung capacity and requires oxygen at all times.   Can someone please just be straight up with me here and give me some sort of ballpark on the chances to recovery?

I found a paper discussing the effects that the 1918 flu pandemic had on Iran, and it included some background about the effect of WWI on the Iranian populace as well. A lot of this post is taken directly from this article, either verbatim or slightly paraphrased. (The citation is : Amir Afkhami. \"Compromised Constitutions: The Iranian Experience with the 1918 Influenza Pandemic.\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 77, no. 2 (2003): 367-392. https://muse.jhu.edu/)  So Iran declared its neutrality during WWI, but despite this the great powers used Iran as a battlefield at times. Russia and Britain both had imperialist designs on Iran for various reasons, interfering with its internal politics to try and secure their own interests, and as a result it became a target during the war. Some of the incidents during the war include: the Ottomans chasing the Russians into northwestern Azerbaijan in 1914; In 1915 Wilhelm Wassmuss organized a revolt among the Qashghai tribesman in southern Iran against the British who controlled oilfields in the area; The Russians counterattacked the Ottomans allowing the British to recover control of Southern Iran by 1916; A revolutionary Iranian group called the Jangalis emerged to control the countryside of Gilan in 1917-1918; Britain also tried to use Iran as a springboard to attack Russia in an attempt to reverse the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the new Soviet Union responded by annexing parts of northern Iran.  As a result of the warfare occurring in Iran, there was damage to Iran's economic, industrial and agricultural power. The occupying armies forcefully requisitioned or looted supplies. This led to widespread famine and the spread of disease. Iran's government was also essentially a protectorate surviving at the whims of whichever power was present and winning at the time, leaving them with little ability to actually help their own people. In addition, Ahmad Shah Qajar, the ruler of Iran at the time, was a weak ruler with little influence in his own government. The populace resented his father for authoritarian policies, and in an attempt to address this, Ahmad Shah tried to appoint only the best ministers, but he was unable to control their actions. In the face of the great powers of WWI using their country as a battlefield, and the threat of the Soviet Invasion and their humiliating demands, the populace resented the government's weakness, contributing to the political instability.  While political instability and warfare can lead to famines, the biggest cause is often climatic. 1916 and 1917 were both years with very dry summers, leading to crop failures. This, coupled with the foreign armies seizing what food they could, resulted in widespread famine, which was worsened by hoarders and speculators. When the influenza pandemic broke out in the spring of 1918, grain supplies had hit a low point, prices had doubled from six months before, (which had reached a ten-year peak). In addition, there were outbreaks of bubonic plague, cholera, malaria and typhus. The British were also building up for their attack on the Soviet Union, and sponsoring a native military contingent known as the \"South Persia Rifles\", making long-term contracts with large landowners for grain to feed the troops, adding to the scarcity.  F.A.C. Forbes-Leith describes the situation in what I assume is a memoir, Checkmate: Fighting Tradition in Central Persia. (I haven't read the actual book and am using a citation from Afkhami's article).  >\"The country was in a terrible state and the peasantry was in the last stages of starvation. Every time I was forced to stop my car, I was surrounded by hundreds of near-skeletons who screamed and fought for such scraps as I was able to spare. In a single day's journey of fifty-six miles between the towns of Kirind and Kermanshah, I counted twenty-seven corpses by the roadside, most of them those of women and children, and the general condition of life amongst the peasants was so frightful that I was ashamed to eat my simple rations in their presence.\"  So the Iranian famine of 1917-1918 was primarily a man-made catastrophe exacerbated by climatic conditions in which there was also an influx of infectious diseases. The wikipedia listing states that Majd's initial population estimate of 19 million is called into question with other estimates only being 11 million. Afkhami's article says that Iran's projected population at the beginning of 1918 was 11 million, so it may be that the 19 million number comes from *before* WWI broke out, and after the famine it had hit 11 million, at which point the influenza pandemic hit, killing a further 8% to 21% of the population according to Afkhami. (0.8 to 2.3 million). Although Afkhami's footnotes say that the population in 1918 was not too different from the population in 1913, before the war, which I am not sure whether to believe or not, given the effects of famine prior to the flu's arrival."

This is the place to apply for a flair \u2013 the colored text you will have seen next to some user's names indicating their specialization. We are always looking for new flaired users, and if you think you have what it takes to join the panel of historians, you're in the right place!  For examples of previous applications, and our current panel of historians, you can find the previous application thread here, and there is a list of active flaired users](/r/AskHistorians/wiki/flairedusers) on our wiki.  **[Requirements for a flair**  A flair in /r/AskHistorians indicates extensive, in-depth knowledge about an area of history *and* a proven track record of providing great answers in the subreddit. In applying for a flair, you are claiming to have:  * **Expertise in an area of history**, typically from either degree-level academic experience or an equivalent amount of self-study. For more exploration of this, check out this thread.  * The ability to **cite sources** from specialist literature for any claims you make within your area.  * The ability to provide **high quality answers** in the subreddit in accordance with our rules.    For a more in-depth look at how applications are analyzed, consult this helpful guide on our wiki explaining what an answer that demonstrates the above looks like.  **How to apply**  To apply for a flair, simply post in this thread. Your post needs to include:  * Links to **3 to 5 answers** which show a sustained involvement in the community, including at least one within the past month.    * These answers should **all relate to the topic area in which you are seeking flair**. They should demonstrate your claim to **knowledge and expertise** on that topic, as well as your ability to write about that topic **comprehensively and in-depth**. Outside credentials or works can provide secondary support, *but cannot replace these requirements*.  * The **text of your flair** and which category it belongs in (see the sidebar). Be as specific as possible as we prefer flair to reflect the exact area of your expertise as near as possible, but be aware there is a limit of 64 characters.  * If you are a former, now inactive flair, an application with **one** recent flair-quality answer, plus additional evidence of renewed community involvement, is required.  One of the moderators will then either confirm your flair or, if the application doesn't adequately show you meet the requirements, explain what's missing. If you get rejected, don't despair! We're happy to give you advice and pointers on how to improve your portfolio for a future application. Plenty of panelists weren't approved the first time.  If there's a backlog this may take a few days but we will try to get around to everyone as quickly as possible.  **Updated Procedures**  Note that we have made some slight changes to the requirements of the past. Previous applications required all answers to be within the past six months. But we realize that this can sometimes be tough if you write about uncommon topics. We have changed the temporal requirement to be *one* answer that was written in the past month. The answers as a whole will be evaluated holistically with an eye towards a regular pace of contributions. i.e. 3 answers each spaced 3 months apart would be accepted now, but we would likely ask for more recent contributions if an application was one recent answer and the rest over a year old. Flair reflects not only expertise, but involvement in the AskHistorians community.  **\"I'm an Expert About Something But Never Have a Chance to Write About It!\"**  Some topics only come up once in a blue moon, but that doesn't mean you can't still get flair in it! There are a number of avenues to follow, many of which are dealt with in greater detail at the last section of this thread.  **Expected Behavior**  We invest a large amount of trust in the flaired members of /r/askhistorians, as they represent the subreddit when answering questions, participating in AMAs, and even in their participation across reddit as a whole. As such, we do take into account an applicant's user history reddit-wide when reviewing an application, and will reject applicants whose post history demonstrate bigotry, racism, or sexism. Such behavior is not tolerated in /r/askhistorians, and we do not tolerate it from our panelists in any capacity. We additionally reserve the right to revoke flair based on evidence of such behavior after the application process has been completed. /r/AskHistorians is a safe space for everyone, and those attitudes have no place here.  **Quality Contributors**  If you see an unflaired user consistently giving excellent answers, they can be nominated for a \"Quality Contributor\" flair. Just message the mods their username and some example comments which you believe meet the above criteria.  **FAQ Finder**   To apply for FAQ finder, we require demonstration of a consistent history of community involvement and linking to previous responses and the FAQ. We expect to see potential FAQ Finders be discerning in what they link to, ensuring that it is to threads which represent the current standards of the subreddit, and they do so in a polite and courteous manner, both to the 'Asker', and also by including a username ping of the original 'Answerer'.  **Revoking Flair**  Having a flair brings with it a greater expectation to abide by the subreddit's rules and maintain the high standard of discussion we all like to see here. The mods will revoke the flair of anybody who continually breaks the rules, fails to meet the standard for answers in their area of expertise, or violates the above mentioned expectations. Happily, we almost never have to do this.  **Additional Resources**  Before applying for flair, we encourage you to check out these resources to help you with the application process:  * Our Rules Roundtable on what a 'Good Answer' looks like * Our Wiki Guide on what makes a good application * The Previous Application Threads, to see what makes for successful - and not successful - applications.  * The Sunday Digest, and Monthly Awards which can provide many examples of we are looking for regarding the caliber of flaired users.\n\nAssistant:"

Best to start afresh and just answer the main question: 'what would Jesus have considered the year to be?'  The answer is that in the Roman province of Syria during Jesus' time the standard practice was to refer to years by the regnal year of the Roman emperor.  New year in the Syrian calendar corresponded to 1 October in the Julian calendar, so when Tiberius took the emperorship in August 14 CE, that was the start of 'Tiberius 1'. Two months later, in October, began 'Tiberius 2'.  So for example the most popular ancient choice for the date Jesus died, spring 29 CE, would have been 'Tiberius 16', which began in October 28 CE.   You can in fact see this system being used at one point in the New Testament: *Luke* 3.1-3 puts Jesus' baptism and the start of his ministry in 'the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar's reign'. As a backup it also lists a number of local contemporary rulers and a magistrate.  As in my other post, I recommend E. J. Bickerman's Chronology of the ancient world (2nd ed. 1980) as a guide to these matters. I do not recommend Wikipedia, or pretty much any other encyclopaedia, as they can be guaranteed to contain lots of misinformation about ancient chronography."

What are the factors that explain the resilience against any historical and archeological evidence that explain the existence of the Holocaust? Why is there such resilience against this infamous genocide versus other controversies that occurred? Please, I want to highlight that I am not a denier here.  I like to look into different sides of the argument as people and I learned that how history is taught is also what it is written and interpreted.  Now the evidence that we have (from what I have gathered) of the existence of the Holocaust are plenty.  Firstly, Hitler's speeches and his Mein Kampf book show many hints of the hatred and scapegoating of Jews.  Next are the anti-Jewish acts that occurred in Germany before they are hunted and killed such as businesses that were owned by Jews were closed and declared illegal, homes and shops of Jewish people were vandalised, synapogues were closed, and Jewish people had to wear tags or labels or the Star of David as a clear indicator.  Then, there are the documents and the places that show the existence of the Holocaust. Auschwitz is the most obvious example and a powerful one. The conditions of the place show how the Jews were treated and the uniform that they wore, and the amount of shoes collected of the ones that were killed and gassed, numbers and tattoes in every one and so on.  The Nuremberg trials are also evidence of the existence of war criminals who used the war effort or had some influence in the Nazi party on the acts that were conducted against Jews and other people that were deemed inferior or the enemy of the Germans.  The sheer number, scale and intensity of it feels unbelievably unreal (I must admit, even I find it hard to swallow that people were and are go to such extreme lengths) but many evidence show that this genocide existed.  Now, I want to show a different side here.  When I hear a revisionists' argument or an argument of an Denialist who wants to question the evidence that was gathered, I also want to look into that argument as well.  Is the evidence actually valid and real? Do the Denialists' evidence and arguments also hold as much validity and merit? Can the science of psychology show that the human species is indeed capable of such extreme acts?  At the same time, I am also puzzled and curious as to why there is this level of confirmation bias about this topic, particularly towards the Holocaust.  What are the factors or the reasonings that explain why some people are inclined to deny the collected evidence or question the actuality of this era?  As there a common theme involved such as paranoia or a certain upbringing or anti-governmental attitudes or imperialistic values?  Why is there such focus on wanting to deny the actions that occurred that were made by those who took part of the Holocaust than for example in other genocides or controversial topics that existed, especially in recent memory such as the Armenian genocide or when Japanese-American citizens were put into concentration camps of their own by America when the latter entered the war?  (please correct me if I am wrong whether the concentration camps of the Japanese-Americans were of the same level of poor quality and poor conditions as those of Nazi Germany)\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " My Monday methods on Holocaust denial has already been posted but I also want to repost something I have written some time ag about holocaust denial, its history, prevalence and motive.  **Part 1**  The short version is that people adjust what they choos to believe in accordance with their political prejudices and opinions most of the time and people who advocate Holocaust denial are, in large parts, anti-Semites of some flavor or another.  ## What is the Holocaust? What is Holocaust Denial?  As a starting point, I'm going to define what is the Holocaust and subsequently, what is Holocaust Denial.  Within the relevant scholarly literature, the term Holocaust is defined as the systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of approximately six million Jews and up to half a million Roma, Sinti, and other groups persecuted as \"gypsies\" by the Nazi regime and its collaborators. It took place at the same time as other atrocities and crimes such as the Nazis targeting other groups on grounds of their perceived \"inferiority\", like the disabled and Slavs, and on grounds of their religion, ideology or behavior among them Communists, Socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses and homosexuals. During their 12-year reign, the conservative estimate of victims of Nazi oppression and murder numbers 11 million people, though newer studies put that number at somewhere between 15 and 20 million people.  Holocaust Denial is the attempt and effort to negate, distort, and/or minimize and trivialize the established facts about the Nazi genocides against Jews, Roma, and others most often with the goal to rehabilitate Nazism as an ideology.  Because of the staggering numbers given above, the fact that the Nazi regime applied the tools at the disposal of the modern state to genocidal ends, their sheer brutality, and a variety of other factors, the ideology of Nazism and the broader historical phenomenon of Fascism in which Nazism is often placed, have become \u2013 rightfully so \u2013 politically tainted. As and ideology that is at its core racist, anti-Semitic, and genocidal, Nazism and Fascism have become politically discredited throughout most of the world.  Holocaust Deniers primarily seek to remove this taint from the ideology of Nazism by distorting, ignoring, and misrepresenting historical fact and thereby make Nazism and Fascism socially acceptable again. In other words, Holocaust Denial is a form of political agitation in the service of bigotry, racism, and anti-Semitism.  In his book *Lying about Hitler* Richard Evans summarizes the following points as the most frequently held beliefs of Holocaust Deniers:  > (a) The number of Jews killed by the Nazis was far less than 6 million; it amounted to only a few hundred thousand, and was thus similar to, or less than, the number of German civilians killed in Allied bombing raids. > > (b) Gas chambers were not used to kill large numbers of Jews at any time. > > (c) Neither Hitler nor the Nazi leaderhsip in general had a program of exterminating Europe's Jews; all they wished to do was to deport them to Eastern Europe. > > (d) \"The Holocaust\" was a myth invented by Allied propaganda during the war and sustained since then by Jews who wished to use it for political and financial support for the state of Israel or for themselves. The supposed evidence for the Nazis' wartime mass murder of millions of Jews by gassing and other means was fabricated after the war.  Richard Evans: *Lying about Hitler. History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial*, New York 2001, p. 110]  ## A short history of Holocaust Denial and its methods in the West  Holocaust denialism has its roots in the Nazis' own efforts to hide their crimes from the world. I have gone into this before [here. Especially the efforts of Sonderkommando 1005 and the destruction of records at the end of the war was intended to hide and deny these crimes and thus portray the regime in a more positive light.  This was , of course, used in Nuremberg and other various post war trials by the defendants, who either pushed a narrative of not having known, not having been involved, or all going back to Hitler, Himmler, Heydrich and others who were dead or otherwise not present at Nuremberg (Eichmann e.g., who was made out by Dieter Wisliceny to be sort of a master mind of the Holocaust). Similarly, several defendants at Nuremberg engage in what has developed to become a classical tactics of deniers, e.g. minimizing the numbers, taking code language out of context with phrases such as resettlement, chalking up deaths to disease etc.  Also, surrounding Nuremberg and the revelations of the Nazi crimes, several different strands of fascist, right-wing extremist, and Nazi political agendas started to deny the Holocaust for a variety for reasons. In Germany, you -- of course -- have all the former Nazis who in order present a clean image of the regime and to rehabilitate themselves and the Nazi regime started to write books where they claimed the Holocaust to have either not happened or be the result of a Jewish conspiracy. For example, Otto von dem Bach-Zelewski, former head of an Einsatzgruppe, who had freely given information at the Nuremberg trials and thus saved his skin started in the 1950s to once again reverse his stand and put out a wealth of denialist literature. Similarly, a plethora of former Wehrmacht generals and officers engaged in their own form of denial by either denying the crimes of the regime outright or by presenting the Wehrmacht as not involved in such crimes. Especially the latter, the myth of the clean Wehrmacht, was one of the most successful forms of Holocaust denial and was very popular in Germany until the 80s and can still be observed today.  Another political agenda that used Holocaust denialism as its tool right after the war, was a certain strand of proto-fascist and right-wing extremist thinkers who wanted to clean fascism and their ideology from the strain of being associated with Hitler and the Holocaust. Douglas Reed is such an example. Reed, who was a prominent journalist in Great Britain, was against Hitler but not against Nationalsocialism (he favored the Otto Strasser position). In the late 40s, early 50s he started publishing books which claimed Hitler had been a Zionist agent and his policy of killing the Jews was a Jewish plot to justify the creation of Israel and which was done against the wishes of many Nazis. At some point it became increasingly hard for him to find publishers, so he moved to South Africa and became involved in supporting apartheid politics in SA and Rhodesia.  Another -- and rather odd -- strand of denialism comes from a pacifists. Pacifism had been very popular during the time between the World Wars because of the effects of WWI and after World War Two, a couple of people of the radical pacifist movement saw their positions threatened because the crimes of the Nazis were a major reason why the war against Nazi Germany was portrayed as a moral and necessary war. In the United States, a former mainstream historian and pacifist activist, Harry Elmer Barnes, started publishing literature that claimed the Holocaust was an Allied invention to justify their war against German, which they had started in 1939.  Another example of this is the -- still cited by Holocaust deniers to this day -- work of Paul Rassinier, who in many a ways is the father of modern Holocaust denial. Rassinier, also a staunch pacifist, was a member of the French resistance, where he -- unsuccessfully -- tried to get the Resistance to engage the Nazi occupation peacefully rather than with violence. Arrested by the Nazis in 1943 and deported to the Buchenwald and later Dora-Mittelbau Concentration Camps, Rassinier did write several books and pamphlets after the war in which he denied the existence of gas chambers and of mass extermination - ostensibly because he had never experienced it.  Rassinier was an odd fellow, whose work could be engaged in its own journal article. He, for example, did not deny the brutality of the camps but instead of holding the SS responsible, he blamed his fellow prisoners. Something, which could and has been engaged in modern scholarship as the result of the perfidious Nazi camp system.  But aside from the reason of Rassinier denying the Holocaust because he never experienced it, he also started to engage in Holocaust denial because he was an anti-Semite and a lot of his writing is informed by his hatred for Jews and the state of Israel, which he saw as based on a Jewish lie and as a threat to peace. The fact that Rassinier was a survivor, an academically trained historian, and a Holocaust denying anti-Semite makes his works favorites in denialist circles to this day.  Holocaust denialism the way we know it today started in the 1960s/70s with the rise of neo-fascist and neo-extreme rightits political movements and causes. Not directly referencing Nazism and old-school fascism as their sources of inspiration but still viewing themselves in the same historical lineage, a lot of these people saw themselves as the right counter-movement to the New Left of 1968 and so on. From Arthur Butz to David Irving, it was this generation who had not themselves taken part in the war and in the Anglosphere rejected the narratives of their elders as the Second World War being just, which formed the most tropes, arguments and methods used by Holocaust deniers to this day. This ranges from the supposedly \"scientific\" denialism of Leuchter and Z\u00fcndel to the more subtle relativism of Irving and Nolte to the outright denial of everything like Faurisson's."

                "content": " While there's so much to be said about this topic, I'm going to mention one specific incident that might illustrate some difficulties with reintegration that you might not be familiar with.  As you may know, pre-war Poland had a Jewish population around three and a half million.  During the Holocaust around 98% of them were killed.  Several thousand made it back to Poland afterwards, joining those few who had survived in place and those who had fled to Poland from genocide in other countries.  In July of 1946, just over a year since the end of the war, there were about 200 Jews who had returned home to the town of Kielce, Poland.  Their former homes were no longer available -- a phrase that glosses over another injustice against them -- so most of them were staying in a building they had purchased for temporary housing.  A young boy from the community went missing for two days.  When he turned up, he at first told his father that he had been kidnapped (though it turned out he had just been staying with another family).  The community and local authorities decided that the Jews were to blame, and that they were kidnapping and murdering local children.  -----  This kind of bizarre and unfounded accusation is a centuries-old conspiracy theory called *blood libel* that is still used to this day.  Accusing your rivals of kidnapping and murdering children without any evidence sounds like an impossible slander that couldn't gain any traction.  But this kind of accusation *works*.  Some people will believe their enemies are capable of any crime, justifying any degree of cruelty in return as they imagine themselves to be defending children.  -----  The local authorities in Kielce sent the militia to investigate.  They broke into the Jewish housing and found that (of course) there were no abducted children there.  In any halfway-reasonable investigation, this should have been the end of it; they searched and found no evidence of the supposed crime.  But I think their response to the lack of evidence is illustrative of the situation the Jews of Poland were in.  The militia and the hundreds of people that had gathered outside started robbing, attacking, and murdering their Jewish neighbors.  Many were dragged into the street and beaten to death, some were shot, some were stabbed with bayonets.  By the time soldiers arrived to put a stop to the massacre, 42 people had been killed and dozens more injured.  Then the wounded were attacked on their way to the hospital, then attacked at the hospital, then a lynch mob arrived to demand they be turned over, then people murdered several Jewish passengers on trains passing through...  Over the next year, the majority of the surviving Jews in Poland fled the country.  -----  To answer your question, in many places Jewish survivors of the Holocaust weren't *allowed* to reintegrate, as the genocide wasn't over."

                "content": " There was a significant timegap between the 'last helicopter out of Saigon' and the final PAVN push to capture the city.  Ambassador Martins was flown out at 0500 Saigon Time on April 30, with the last helicopter (carrying the last few Marine guards) left at around 0700 to 0800.    CBS News' Ed Bradley was one of those evacuated at the embassy, and described:  >\"Once inside the compound, for the Americans and those Vietnamese who managed to get in with legal documents and the many who managed entrance without, the rest was easy. It was just a matter of waiting your turn for a helicopter to take you to one of the ships on station off the Vietnamese coast.\"  With Martins having ordered that only Americans be evacuated earlier that dawn, we can deduce that likely no Vietnamese were granted access to the last round of helicopter flights out to sea.  As PAVN troops were assaulting downtown Saigon at the same time, and with South Vietnam unconditionally surrendering at 10:24, we can deduce that few South Vietnamese decided to stick around at the embassy for the three hours after the last helicopter left.  The following days, PAVN forces consolidated their control in Ho Chi Minh City, with the Embassy and other government buildings being raided.    Afterwards, as stated in the Texas Tech Vietnam Oral History Interview of Phong Xuan Nguyen (a former South Vietnamese government official who was imprisoned for five years in a reeducation canp):  >It was decreed that all the high ranking officials\rof the former Saigon regime would have to report for re-education for a period of thirty\rdays...  Nguyen describes that his reeducation was later extended as he had been a very high ranked official.  He describes his conditons at Tu Doc prison in the South:  >Oh, it was very primitive. It was completely empty, the orphanage was\rcompletely empty, no furniture whatsoever and there were buildings with aluminum sheet\rroofing and it was just tiles, very primitive tiles as the floor. We slept on the floor and\rthe food was provided twice a day, lunch and dinner by the administration, very primitive\rtoo but we had rice.  Nguyen interestingly mentions that although familial visits were not allowed, the guards were actually South Vietnamese, who treated the prisoners very courteously.  Nguyen was later moved to a prison camp in North Vietnam, where all prisoners were directed to write a 'self-confession'.  Nguyen was later put to work alongside other prisoners; he, specifically, became a mason and designed decorative ceramics.  Other prisoners might be assigned to work in the fields or in other craftsmen roles.  He was paid a small allowance as well.  All in all, I doubt that any Vietnamese were arrested at the Embassy, but if they were high ranking officials, they likely were imprisoned in reeducation camps for anywhere between thirty days and five years.  I took the Fall of Saigon timeline information from Olivier Todd's *Cruel April* and the interview from Texas Tech's Vietnam Archive"

                "content": " The charge that Islam was an import to Africa did show up among Nation of Islam\u2019s (NOI) critics. Kwame Ture (at the time known as Stokely Carmichael) of the Black Panthers charged that \u201cIslam is not an African religion,\u201d and argued Islamic expansion was linked to the slave trade. NOI members rebutted this in different ways. The most common way was to argue on the basis of NOI\u2019s cosmology that Islam actually predated Muhammad and was connected with the creation of the Black people.  **Nation of Islam\u2019s Creation Story**  The Nation of Islam\u2019s (NOI) version of Islamic history differs quite dramatically from most historians' or popular understandings of Islamic history. NOI understood Islam to be the original religion of humanity from the beginning of time 66 trillion years ago and original humans to be Black. According to NOI\u2019s understanding, Black people had brought Islam to the Middle East, not the other way around.  According to the teachings of Elijah Mohammad, the founder of NOI, the first people were Arabic speaking Black Muslims of the Tribe of Shabazz. Earth was originally a utopia governed by a council of 24 Black Muslim scientists. This paradise was lost when an evil scientist named Yacub created white people out of experiments on the Black race. White people were understood to be devils. Islam\u2019s origins according to NOI were not actually in the Middle East or connected with Muhammad.  **Defending Islam as a Black religion**  In 1971 Edward L.X. Truitt spoke out against Carmichael\u2019s claim that Islam was not an African religion by contending that \u201cIslam is the religion of the Original people, who are Black, brown, red, and yellow descendants of the original Black Man, the maker and owner of planet earth.\u201d Thus, Islam was actually the creation of Black people. Embracing Islam for Black people was seen as a restoration of a lost heritage.  Other NOI members argued that the any effort to portray Islam as foreign to Africa was a plot to undermine NOI and Elijah Muhammad. Diogenes X. Grassal, for example, denounced any contemporary focus on African culture as a plan by white people to undermine Black men. According to Grassal, Yoruba and Swahili were inferior languages to Arabic, and Islam was the source of all Black achievement in Egypt, Arabia, Asia, and West Africa. Charles 67X denounced Black nationalists like Amiri Baraka for contending Arab Muslims had harmed Africa. 67X maintained that Islam had brought advanced civilization to Africa. NOI members often took harshly critical views towards Africa, which they believed to be primitive without the teachings of Islam.  **NOI and Moorish Science**  I have previously written on AskHistorians about the NOI\u2019s roots in the earlier Moorish Science Temple, an Islamic movement which appeared in Chicago after World War I. Like the later NOI movement, Moorish Science, was not grounded in traditional Sunni or Shia understandings of Islam or deeply concerned with the historical particulars of Islam, Muhammad, or early Islamic history in the Middle East. Both movements instead claimed that Islam was racially connected with Black Americans.  **Summary**  NOI\u2019s understanding of Islam\u2019s origins, teachings, and spread, had little to do with secular or mainstream Islamic understandings of history. For NOI, Islam was not a Middle Eastern religion, it was a Black religion, which had been associated with Black people since human beings had existed. Debates about Islamic expansion and involvement in the slave trade did not matter to NOI\u2019s sense of sacred history.

                "content": " The term \"U-Boat\" has an interested and complicated history. It has been ingrained in popular consciousness through decades of books, movies, TV shows, and video games. There are a never ending parade of new books come out that have U-Boat in the title. Some include:  * *Hitler\u2019s U-Boat War: The Hunters, 1939-1942*, * *America\u2019s U-Boats: Terror Trophies of World War I*,  * *The Merchant U-Boat: Adventures of the Deutschland, 1916-1918*, * *Hitler\u2019s \u201cWonder\u201d U-Boats: The Birth of the Cold War\u2019s Hunter Killer Submarines*  It is safe to say this is a very truncated list of \"U-Boat\" books but are some examples of the way that it gets used today: to refer exclusively to German submarines. Now, it is a term I try to avoid in my writing - even when discussing German submarines. The first reason for this is that there exists a direct English translation for *unterseeboot*: submarine. It is a word whose meaning is fully captured by a direct translation. Secondly, it is a *half translation* of the German. The short german version of *Unterseeboot* is *U-Boot*, not \"U-Boat\".   I also wish to avoid the romanticization and mystification that comes from utilizing German terminology. The term \u201cu-boat\u201d adds a layer of mystery to German submarines that did not exist during the First World War and through using the term, usage of the submarine gets tied almost entirely to Germany. In equating submarines with Germany, authors can give a false impression about the scope of submarine operations to the war, while also giving a romantic edge to a policy which resulted in the deliberate deaths of civilians. It gets used as a term of romanticization, that makes German submarines into an \"other\", even though many other countries were using their submarines in the same or similar ways during both World Wars. The Germans **DID NOT** have a monopoly on submarines or submarine operations. Why use a term which invites a romantizied and simple interpretation?  The term additionally invokes images of Nazi Germany and its submarine campaigns during the Second World War. There was nothing particularly special about German submarines during the First World War that necessitates identifying them by a German word. Authors do not refer to French submarines as \u201csous-marins\u201d in their writing, thus the same standard should be applied to the Germans. What set German submarines apart was how they were utilized, but this was not inherent to the submarine itself and that can be appropriately expressed without utilizing the term \u201cU-Boat.\u201d  I would go as far to say that the same applies to German submarines of the Second World War. The linked answer from u/Georgy_K_Zhukov best frames these sorts of reasons for avoiding the term.  OK so, with the reasons why *I* try to avoid \"U-Boat\" in my writing, lets dig into some of its history.  \"U-Boat\" starts to appear in English publications as shorthand for \"Submarine\" in late 1915. The beginning of the war saw positive comments in the American press about British, French, and German submarines - but these articles always used the word \"sub\" or \"submarine\" with the nation acting as an adjective. It's not until months after the *Lusitania* was sunk on May 7th, 1915 that \"U-Boat\" starts to appear.  This may seem like a logical point for the \"otherizing\" nature of \"U-Boat\" to have begun - but it's actually not! At this point, the phrase was being used in lieu of \"Sub\" or \"Submarine\" in headlines and photo captions. \"U-Boat\" was being used as a direct substitute for those words in newspapers to *save space* in areas where that was a key concern. This interpretation is borne out by the fact that the phrase \"U-Boat\" was utilized in headlines and captions to describe **ANY** submarine, not just German ones. There were articles about American submarines called \"Uncle Sam's U-Boats\" (referring to submarines built and operated by the US, not the captured ones discussed in that book I mentioned above) and \"British U-Boats\" and \"French U-Boats\". In the text of these articles, the term \"U-Boat\" wasn't used instead they said \"German subs\" or \"American submarines\". So in essence the phrase first took hold as a way of saving space in headlines and captions in newspapers during the First World War, and it's clear that there was at least some understanding that the Allies *also* were using Submarines in various ways.  Even the American war history for Submarine Division 5, whose sole purpose in Ireland was to hunt for German submarines, does not use the term. They use \"the enemy\", \"hun\", \"Germans\", \"submarine\" - but not \"U-Boat\". And they were fighting them!  What set the Germans apart in the First World War was mostly their usage. Not in specifically waging an anti-shipping campaign (as the British and Russians conducted one in the Baltic Sea, and the British and French in the Sea of Marmara) but in an \"unrestricted\" campaign where merchant vessels (initially belligerent in 1915, but eventually also neutral in 1917) were liable to be sunk without warning - their crew and passengers not allowed to get to safety. The *overall* usage of German submarines was often similar to the Allies, and their boats were roughly the same. Yes, there were some differences in endurance, class types, and specific pieces of technology (the Allies usually bemoaned their periscopes compared to the German ones, for example)  - but these were not huge gulfs in submarine technology (especially since the British developed and deployed some of the most sophisicated submarines of the war). German submarines were pretty similar to their Allied counterparts, and this is reflected in the phrase \"U-Boat\" being applied to all nations.  This practice did not end with the start of the Second World War in Europe. There were newspapers applying \"U-Boat\" to British and French submarines up through 1941. So not even the unrestricted campaign up to that point of the Second World War was enough to entirely associate \"U-Boat\" with Germany. It's not seen after 1942, leading me to suspect that US entry into the Second World War was a decisive factor in needing to \"otherize\" German submarines.  That is in more popular parlance. The term may have gained hold among those in the Naval service when talking about a specific **class** of German submarines. A piece of evidence for this is a lecture given Captain T.C. Hart in 1920. He had been an officer in the US Submarine force during the First World War. In his lecture, he does refer to \"U-Boats\", but when he does he is referring specifically to the \"*U*\" Class. He differentiates them from the \"*UB*\" and \"*UC*\" classes. This is an area which requires a bit more investigation.  So in essence, no it's my opinion that we should not be using the term \"u-boat\". They're just submarines, and we're doing readers a historical disservice to treat German submarines as a mysterious \"other\", when they were so very similar to their Allied counterparts and to how the term was historically used.  Also tagging /u/tough_guys_wear_pink as you might find this interesting."

                "content": " There is a plethora of definitions for Fascism, from defining it as a very narrowly by limiting it to the historical phenomenon of Mussolini's rule in Italy to a very broad definition like the one used historically by Marxists, which I have described in-depth in this thread.  The one I found most useful and sensible within the context of my own historical work  is the approach used by Robert Paxton in his book *The Anatomy of Fascism*, which defines Fascism from a praxeological standpoint.  Paxton points out in his introduction that despite Fascism being a major phenomenon of the 20th century, even now no definition of Fascism has obtained universal assent as a complete satisfactory account of the phenomenon. Fascist movements varied so strongly from one national setting to another that some scholars even cast doubt that the term is more than a political smear word.  However, it is also impossible to ignore how many movements in inter-war Europe and even beyond chose the descriptor of Fascism for themselves as well as what kind of structural and practical similarities existed between many of these movements.  One of the major factors, Paxton points to when examining Fascist movements its view on what drives history: Unlike the advocators of liberal democracy, it is not reason or modernization, which drives forward and unlike communists, it is not material relationships. For the Fascist the engine of history is conflict, whether between nations, peoples or races. History is a constant struggle in which a community of mythical qualities needs to assert itself in order to gain dominance over others. Dominance is the core goal and must be asserted. And only if the right and rightful people dominate will a golden age begin.  The political utopia of the Fascist differs greatly from liberal or communist visions of utopia: Both of the latter are build on a vision of a utopian future that needs to be build and achieved. The Fascist on the other hand looks to the past for its utopia since most fantasies of dominance are historically justified. Whether it is the return to the Roman Empire or the mythical Lebensraum of German kings, all Fascist utopian visions are build upon a return to a hazy, mythological past in which the world was right.  This factory is depended on and at the same time leads to the strong inherently anti-modernist rhetoric of Fascist movements. From tropes such as the city corrupting the purity of rural live or the return to a blood-and-soil type romantic idyll or decrying the devaluation of the core family and the place of women in society as \"unnatural\" Fascism espouses a rhetoric that uses the past to justify a complete and total criticism of the present and advocates building an alternate modernity in the image of a supposedly \"pure\" past.  Consequently, Fascists see themselves as not merely espousing an ideology but rather, a creed or \u2013 as the Nazis called it \u2013 a Weltanschauung (roughly translated as \"world view\"). As Paxton writes:  > In a way unlike the classical \"isms\", the rightness of fascism does not depend on the truth of any proposition advanced in its name. Fascism is \"true\" insofar as it helps fulfill the destiny of a chosen race or people or blood, locked with other peoples in a Darwinian struggle, and not in the light of some abstract universal reason. (...) The truth was whatever permitted the new fascist man (and woman) to dominate others, and whatever made the chosen people triumph. > > Fascism rested not upon the truth of its doctrine but upon the leader's mystical union with historic destiny of his people. (...) The fascist leader wanted to bring his people into a higher realm of politics that they would experience sensually: the warmth of belonging to a race now fully aware of its identity, historic destiny, and power; the excitement of participating in a vast collective enterprise; the gratification of submerging oneself in a wave of shared feelings, and of sacrificing one's petty concerns for the group's good; and the thrill of domination. Fascism deliberate replacement of reasoned debate with immediate sensual experience transformed politics, as the exiled cultural critic Walter Benjamin was first to point, into aesthetics. And the ultimate fascist aesthetic experience, Benjamin warned in 1936, was war. >  > Fascist leaders made no secret of having no program. (...) Fascism radical instrumentalization of truth explains why fascists never bothered to write any casuistical literature when they changed their program as they did often and without compunction. Stalin was forever writing to prove that his policies accorded somehow with the principles of Marx and Lenin; Hitler and Mussolini never bothered with any such theoretical justification.  In the same vein, Paxton goes on to define Fascism as   > a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victim-hood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.  What is important here is not only that Fascism operates always under the assumption of threat resulting from the inherent view on the way history always functions as a conflict; it's also imperative that Paxton defines it as a form of political behavior rather than a stringent world-view.  In service of the core narrative of threat and conflict, an ill-defined and mythical past to which the goal is to return, and Fascisms use of authoritarian means to these ends, Fascism is the turning of politics into spectacle and an aesthetic experience. It doesn't matter in a sense what kind of program it is espousing at the moment but the imperative lies in an utopia with an open definition in whose service the experience of community against the forces that threaten the community, the way of life, the \"chosen race\" have rallied. Who these enemies are depend on historical and national context, it is the underlying practice that is so essential to the political behavior of Fascism.  Paxton's approach to the subject has been immensely useful in my own studies of Nazi Germany because rather than listicles providing definitions of fascism according to its content or trying to cut through the literature published by Nazis and Italian and other Fascists in order to analyze common threads and construct a Weberian \"ideal type\" of fascism, this approach is best able to serve as a framework when it comes to what is often perceived as the internal inconsistencies of Nazism, from revolutionary rhetoric in its early periods to alliances with traditional social elites to the eclectic mix of Roman, Germanian and other aesthetic to serve propagandist ends. Even the self-description of \"National Socialism\" can best understood as embracing a certain political methodology and practice rather than a profession for what we tend to understand as any form of actual socialism.  Fascism is therefore about function and form, not so much concrete content. Paxton goes on in his book to examine historically fascist movements throughout the various stages they moved through and while expanding upon them here would probably lead too far, I can not recommend his book highly enough. Towards the end of his book, he writes about Fascism outside of Europe and in light of recent renewed interest in the subject in the US, I think the following passage is especially pertinent:  > The United States itself has never been exempt from fascism. (...) Much more dangerous [than movements like the American Nazi Party, which utilize already established tenants and creeds from Europe] are movements that employ authentically American themes in ways that resemble fascism functionally. The Klan revived in the 1920s, took on virulent anti-Semitism, and spread to the cities of the Middle West. In the 1930s, Father Charles E. Coughlin gathered a radio audience estimated at forty million around anti-communist, anti-Wall Street, pro-soft money, and \u2013 after 1938 \u2013 anti-Semtic message broadcast from his church in the outskirts of Detroit. (...) Today a \"politics of resentment\" rooted in authentic American piety and nativism sometimes leads to violence against some of the very same \"internal enemies\" once targeted by the Nazis, such as homosexuals and defenders of abortion rights. > > Of course the United Staes would have to suffer catastrophic setbacks and polarization for these fringe groups to find powerful allies and enter the mainstream. I half expected to see emergence after 1968 a movement of national reunification, regeneration, and purification directed against hirsute antiwar protesters, black radicals, and \"degenerate\" artists. I thought that some of the Vietnam veterans might form analogs to the Freikorps of 1919 Germany and Itlaian Arditi, and attack youths whose demonstrations on the steps of the Pentagon had \"stabbed them in the back\". Fortunately, I was wrong (so far). (...) > > The language and symbols of an authentic American fascism would, of course, have little to do with the original European models. They would have to be familiar and reassuring to loyal Americans as the language and symbols of the original fascism were familiar and reassuring to many Italians and Germans. (...) No swastikas in an American fascism, but Stars and Stripes (or Stars and Bars) and Christian corsses. No fascist salute, but mass recitation of the pledge of allegiance. These symbols contain no whiff of fascism in themselves, of course, but an American fascism would transform them into obligatory litmus tests for detecting the internal enemy.\""

                "content": " I can offer a bit of (partial) information about the return of German tourists in France after 1945.   German people, in the decade following WW2, were not much able to travel for a simple reason: the \"economic miracle\" had yet to materialize, and they had other priorities, such as the reconstruction of their households. From V-Day to the currency reform of June 1948 that took place in the Western occupation zones, German economy was dominated by barter and black market. While the reform had positive effects, people lost their wartime savings. In 1950, an average middle-class German family of four could only spend about 7% of its budget on leisure, recreation and entertainment: the rest of the budget was used for food, rent, heating, power and essential transport (Kopper, 2008). Vacations, if they were feasible, were taken at home or domestically. In addition, the German tourist industry had been thoroughly destroyed. In the early 1950s, it was still about one-third the size it had been in 1936 (Kosha, 2000). It is thus not suprising that the numbers of German visitors (tourists and business) were extremely low in the late 1940s. British statistics show that there were 55000 German visitors in the UK in 1938: they were 1000 in 1946, 8000 in 1947, 18000 in 1948 and 20000 in 1949 (vs 87000 from France the same year).  It was possible for Germans to go to France in the immediate postwar if they had a good reason to do so that was not \"leisure\", such as business, administration, or academia. In August 1945, Jesuit priest and former Resistance member Jean du Rivau founded the Franco-German magazine *Documents/Dokumente* with the purpose of advancing the cause of Franco-German reconciliation. Rivau organized a first meeting of French and German intellectuals in Offenburg, Germany in 1947, and then another one in Royaumont, France in October 1948. Among the German participants were Joseph Rovan, Eugen Kogon, Walter Dirks, and Elisabeth Langg\u00e4sser, who all had been opponents to the Nazi regime (Kogon had spent the entire war in Buchenwald), which certainly gave them proper credentials to visit France (Plum, 2007). They were not \"tourists\", but it shows that the French border was not closed to \"good\" Germans.   Another type of German visitors who were the first to arrive were catholic pilgrims. A German delegation went to Lourdes in 1947 (Courtabessis, 1947) and, two years later, four trains departing from Cologne, Munich, Hannover, and Mainz, transported 1200 German pilgrims, a cardinal and a bishop to Lourdes (*Combat*, 14 July 1949; *L'Aube*, 20 July 1949). In 1950, German visitors in Paris were business people (27%), functionaries (31%), and academics (25%) (*Carrefour*, 25 July 1951).  In 1951, France authorized Germans to get tourist visas. The money they could spend was limited to 500 DM + 100 DM for automobile drivers (this limit was raised in 1953, and removed in 1959). The first \"official\" German tourists spent their time in Paris, Lyon, and the Riviera. Numbers of German visitors grew steadily, from a mere 25,000 in 1949 to 400,000 in 1955, reaching 732,000 in 1961, more than British tourists. Half came by road and 35% by train. They were poorer than British and American tourists, with two-third of German tourists staying in 1-star and 2-star hotels vs 49% for the British and 28% for the Americans. Group visits resumed in 1954 (Ginier, 1963). By then, the German economy had been revived, and its tourist industry was working again, with German tour operators sending people abroad by thousands. In 1958, more West Germans traveled abroad than foreigners visited the Federal Republic (Koshar, 2000).  How were German visitors received in France? An article from 1951 (*Carrefour*, 25 July 1951) presents German tourists in a gently mocking way (\"The Germans have always been very fond of France. In their own way, of course...\"). A cartoon shows a (male) German tourist looking at the Eiffel Tower, at Mona Lisa, at a can-can dancer, and then running (lusting) after a woman. The article describes the tourist attractions preferred by the Germans: museums, religious sites, the Eiffel Tower, music halls, and prostitutes. Concerning the latter, the article recommends that the German tourist presents himself as a Swiss citizen: French prostitutes, while loving foreign customers, are not fond of German ones. The article ends by presenting German tourists as discreet and self-effacing, preferring wine to beer, and avoiding to be identified as German. It concludes:  >In general, he is held by hoteliers, taxi drivers, restaurant owners, transporters, to be \"exact, clean, correct and very disciplined\". The war is already far away...  According to Wackerman (1994):  >The Germans, satisfied on the whole with their stay in France, although often below expectations as regards the quality of the service and the tourist offer in general, still complained repeatedly about the coolness of the welcome in the shops or in the street, the psychological barriers being tenacious in all categories of the population and all age groups; in young people, a \"thawing\" or the absence of rejection was nevertheless noticed.   Genier (1963):  >[The German tourist] does not appreciate the excessive prices charged by a hotel that is questionable for its cleanliness and the vulgarity of its staff. Finally, he would gladly exchange the evening meal, which is too copious, for a modern and better lit room!   From these short and incomplete presentation, it seems that German tourism was normalized rather quickly in France, basically as soon as Germans were able to afford vacationing abroad in the 1950s. France, of course, was counting on foreign tourists, including German ones, to recapture its position as the Number 1 tourist nation in Europe, which it had lost in the late thirties (Commissariat G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Tourisme, 1950). The fact that there was more than 700,000 German tourists in 1961 is an indication that they were relatively well received, with the older generations of French people being somewhat colder to them than the younger one.

                "content": "\n\nHuman: Dealing with Fallout of a Terminated Employee     Hi HR folks and r/AskHR  I am posting so I can get your advice on a tough situation and hopefully gain a different perspective of POV on a weird situation.  I figured my best is to ask the professionals directly!  Thank you in advance for your help - I really do appreciate the time you take to help me out on your personal time.  **Background**  I manage a team of 10 professionals in North Dakota, USA. My team specializes in a highly technical field. The firm is a well established consulting company and is pretty traditional. About a year ago, I hired a former employee of mine from a competing firm. He was a good employee, dependable and a delight to be around when we worked together. I even considered Bill to be a friend and he would often talk on the phone, more often than not he would share things he is struggling with and asked for advice. Let's call him Bill. After a brief amount of time joining me at the new company, Bill recommends I hire his friend Steve. Bill and Steve had worked together recently, and given the respect I had for Bill, I figured Steve would be a good fit for the company and we needed some help. Bill really stuck his neck out for Steve, even though Steve's resume was a little light. I went with it because I figured it to be trustworthy referral and when I have managed teams before, referrals end up being the best employees.  **Here is the skinny**  Steve had a rough start. Very defensive. Prone to emotional outbursts and verbally attacking me. He constantly argued about really simple stuff and saying it wasn't my job to tell him what to do, even though I was his supervisor. HR stepped in and I essentially took the blame for all of this. I was directed to take leadership training and couldn't have any direct communications with Steve unless a 3rd party was involved. I really go thrown under the bus hardcore.  I thought the personal side of things were getting better between Steve and me after the first run-in with HR; however, his technical side of things was not improving. He struggled to meet deadlines. The quality of his stuff was not improving even though it is relatively cookie cutter stuff. He also kept repeating the same mistakes over and over and over. I gave him all the training he asked for but still complained about needing more. And then he started to really lose it. He went back to his old ways but this time, HR saw all what he was doing and everything was being monitored by the 3rd party person. HR essentially came to the conclusion that Steve had to be let ago and he was terminated back in early November 2019.  I got wind recently of the convos between Bill and Steve. All the text, emails, and DMs. Everything. Bill doesn't know this. It appears that Bill and Steve were kinda conspiring against me. This whole time Bill was telling me he was my friend and just wanted everyone to get along . . . but was was telling Steve the times he was going over my head, meeting with HR trying to get Steve to report directly to Bill and bunch of other conniving things to get me fired or demoted. Bill used what I perceived as a friendship to manipulate and take advantage of me. I feel betrayed and has really eroded my trust with about everyone I work with.  **Here is my ask of you**  Now that Steve is gone, how do I go about handling Bill? How I address his behavior and what all do I share with him about what I know happened in the background? Do I not share at all and if so, why? I want Bill to stay for the long term and I want to minimize any interaction with HR. I don't want HR to think I can't manage my team and that they need to step in all the time something goes wrong. if HR is required to step in, I not opposed to doing so, but I don't want to come off as meek or unable to manage a difficult situation. I also have no trust in my company's HR group. I don't want to come off as threatening to Bill or give him the impression of \"its this way or the highway\". That is not my style. I do want to make sure there is no doubt his behavior is unacceptable. How do I use this opportunity to establish that I am the leader of the group and how can I best learn from this situation? How do I further insulate and protect myself so I don't come off as a the bad guy and best protect my job?  There are a bunch of questions out there and I am probably not asking them all here. Any help, suggestions, feedback, or action items would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAssistant:"

Having someone actively sowing discord on your team is never going to work out well. This was an unforgivable act of insubordination.   I\u2019d be documenting as much as possible, writing him up as often as you can, and always ensure you gave a \u201cthird party\u201d present when your giving constructive feedback or write ups. Then fire him. HR knows his history as part of the \u201ccoup\u201d so with write ups, it\u2019s shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to fire him. If they push back on you, I\u2019d mention all the ways that this is opening them up to liability, \u201ctoxic work environment\u201d, \u201cworkplace bullying\u201d, etc. There\u2019s no such thing as an employee you can\u2019t live without.  And this would be an alright way to show you can manage your team. Managing isn\u2019t just making do with the shitty people you\u2019ve got, it\u2019s building a successful team... sometimes that requires subtracting a few people.   In future, it\u2019s a pretty easy line to draw to just not be friends with employees. Be friendly, but not friends. Either they expect special treatment bc if your friendship or your opening yourself up to employees using your personal info against you though this is a pretty out there situation... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you\u2019ll encounter again anytime soon."

Somebody will make reference to her quick bathroom break.  She says \"oh yeah, I save time by not washing my hands when I pee.\"  And usually a few people will chuckle.  I thought it was disgusting once but she's done it four times total now.  She does it in meetings with C-suite executives and meetings with her direct reports.  This woman is our VP of operations and has an MBA.  Am I a prude? I just find this topic of conversation disgusting. Nobody needs to know your bathroom habits. I know some people don't wash their hands after going Number 1. Whatever fine, I side on you're touching bathroom surfaces covered in god knows what. But whatever, fine. Why does she need to disclose this, repeatedly. I think it's unbecoming for anybody in a professional setting, let alone a vice president in the organization.

Given that - according to Thompson - no one has any obligation to restrict themselves in this way, the acceptance of this argument would seem to also push one to reject the enforced lockdowns we have seen throughout 2020.

Lockdowns, mask laws, etc. are not in the same category - they are regulations about public activity, like requiring clothing in public or preventing people from pooping on the floor in public cafeterias.  So when you assert that lockdowns \"restrict people's bodily autonomy greatly\" you are making a category error. They restrict other things like apparel and movement, but do not affect bodily autonomy because they do not involve changes to the subject's body.

(actually a physics question, I promise) I was thinking about the structure of the universe, the distance of objects close to the edge of the observable universe, Doppler shift, background radiation and stuff, and I had a sudden realization that I'm wondering about:  Given that space itself is mostly empty, and therefore colorless, is the night sky dark because of one or a combination of the following factors?  A) (this is the big one for me) the sky is mostly dark because even if we could see infinitely distant, there was a time in the early universe before there was light, and that was true for the whole universe at the time, therefore as we look back in time the more distant we see, everything is dark.  B) very distant objects and early structures are receding from us so fast that their light will never reach us.  C) light from very distant objects gets absorbed or reflected by whatever atoms or molecules get in the way, and because the distances are so insignificant great, even though space is a NEAR vacuum, there are so many atoms between us and the edge of the observable universe that most early light never makes it to us.  *Bonus thought that I also might posit as its own question: Given a distance of let's say 5 billion light years between two points in space-time, not objects just positions in the universe: Since the early days of the universe they've remained proportionally the same distance apart, but observationally would they appear more distant from each other? Because space is expanding - so the \"length or size\" of a unit of distance is expanding - for example due to the expansion of the universe the proportional distance between millimeters stays the same, but the space between subatomic particles ever so slightly grows, as does the size of a millimeter. It's still just one millimeter, but would it seem longer than it did a long time ago? Does that mean time is getting longer as well? If we define a second as so many oscillations of a certain atom, but the distance that atom has to swing is growing, does that mean that the length of a unit of time is expanding too? If a person from today were to count seconds in 5B years, would our person seem to tick seconds off too fast?*\n\nAssistant:"

To a radio telescope, the sky is uniformly bright - it is filled with the cosmic microwave background.  As for your second question you have some misunderstandings. The length between two distant points does grow (the number of rulers that one could fit between them is greater now than in the past) but the space between atoms does not. The universe's expansion only affects the largest scales - it does not operate on individual atoms, or even individual galaxies. And it is purely an expansion of space - there is no effect on time."

But most of the visible light you encounter on a normal day is way less powerful than a 2 kw microwave oven. A rule-of-thumb power level for received light from the sun is max around 1300 watts per square meter of ground, in full on sunlight. From there it drops very rapidly for low angle sun, clouds, aerosols etc.. Your microwave is a tiny box and it's 2000 w.  Given that you've got the same focusing and the same absorbance (which isn't to be taken for granted), you'd get the same amount of power out of 2 kw of microwave and 2 kw sunlight. This effect would only be heating. But with sunlight parts of it would be in the uv range which is ionizing and so it has much higher potential for harm for living creatures.  If you want some context to this, try to imagine what 2 kw of light is actually like. I've got LED ceiling lights that consume something like 10 w and they're pretty damn bright, and I don't know their exact efficiency but it's not close to 100%.

The most likely effect it would cause would be seizures or headaches. However, the response of a brain is quite variable and wouldn't act exactly like a circuit.  ---  I did a study a while ago performing transcranial magnetic stimulation, where you *do* induce a current in someone's neurons to fire them. This allows you to among other things twitch a person's muscles using an EM field on the region of the scalp connected to the muscle in question.  However, it takes a rather strong magnetic field of about 2 Tesla, which is about as strong as an MRI magnet. Compare this with the strength of magnetic fields from household appliances or nearby power lines, which are all in the 100 nT\u2013100 \u00b5T range (LIPA - Magnetic Field Levels Around Homes) and at least 10 000 times too small.  But even still at this strength, the cortex (outer structures, involved with cognitive processing and movement coordination) of the brain is what is made to fire since the inner structures (involved with emotional functions) are kept insulated. So, you could potentially cause someone to have a seizure or headache but would be unlikely to (electrically) induce an emotional response. This fits with what you would see in the comparatively uncoordinated EM field used in electroconvulsive therapy.  It's also important to remember that neurology isn't electronics and it's quite an incomplete model to think of the brain as an electronic circuit of neurons. In many ways, the brain is far more adaptive, flexible, and durable. Similarly, a neuron is not made of solid metal with a sea of electrons carrying charge like a wire but is instead a bag of fluid within fluid enclosed by a membrane keeping potassium ions inside and sodium ions outside. The mechanism (the action potential, AP) a neuron uses to carry a current involves a change in shape of certain proteins triggered in a certain sequence, which allows the sodium and potassium ions to swap places. If an AP is properly induced, it reaches the tail end of the neuron and can trigger the next neuron in sequence to be fired via neurotransmission across the synapse. You would effectively need the effect to go across the synapse for it to have any relevance in more than just once neuron.  Inducing a *sufficiently strong* current allows this mechanism to occur. Otherwise, you won't get a full AP and no effect *between* cells. The neuron is able to effectively ignore small transient currents that aren't strong enough to induce an AP."

I probably have over 10,000 hours of recordings of waterfalls and whitewater features. Most of them have some peak frequency or at least plateau frequency band, generally in the tens to hundreds of Hz range but lower at big waterfalls, and with power dropping off gradually at higher and lower frequencies. White noise, by contrast, is the same at all frequencies. * This field is extremely small, and I don't know of a single scientist who has devoted significant effort into the mechanisms explaining waterfall spectra. There's a lot of arm-wavy explanations in this thread, which is better than nothing. If you disagree that this is an unsolved problem, show me a citation or equation quantitatively explaining waterfall sound spectra. * What mechanisms could be involved? Some possibilities I've heard are the impact sounds of water drops hitting the pool, bubble-related processes (e.g., collapses due to high transient pressures), standing waves (hydraulic jumps), and turbulence. Note that not all noisy whitewater features have water drops falling through air and striking a pool; however, all noisy whitewater features have turbulence (and most, if not all, have bubbles). * Bottom line, **we don't really know**, which is pretty exciting but also pretty inconvenient. I think a big reason why we don't know is that this is a pretty challenging problem (there's turbulence\\*\\* and complex waterfall geometries involved), spanning multiple fields (hydraulics, acoustics, and geomorphology), and understanding it isn't a huge societal or industrial priority (unlike, say, turbulence around aircraft). * Maybe a better approach to your question is to instead pick a thing that waterfalls could sound like (e.g., trumpets) and ask why they don't sound like that. Lots of familiar sounds involve pure tones with or without overtones; those are often produced by some sort of resonance. Other things, like car engines, are inherently cyclical and driven at some RPM. Waterfalls don't have resonance and are not cyclical.   \\*My own research is very observational and focused on hydrological needs--what kinds of whitewater features result in what kinds of noise, and what can the noises tell hydrologists about stream discharge and changes in stream characteristics. I'm focusing on hydrological applications because that's what I have funding to do.  \\*\\*If you are not aware that turbulence is a hard problem, now you are.

Krugman for example writes about the 1980s Savings & Loan scandal. Thumbnail summary and full audit reports here:  >During the 1980s, the savings and loan industry experienced severe financial losses because extremely high interest rates caused institutions to pay high rates on deposits and other funds while earning low yields on their long-term loan portfolios. During this period, regulators reduced capital standards and allowed the use of alternative accounting procedures to increase reported capital levels. While these conditions were occurring, institutions were allowed to diversify their investments into potentially more profitable, but risky, activities. **The profitability of many of these activities depended heavily on continued inflation in real estate values to make them economically viable**. In many cases, diversification was accompanied by inadequate internal controls and noncompliance with laws and regulations, thus further increasing the risk of these activities.  >As a result of these factors, many institutions experienced substantial losses on their loans and investments, a condition that was made worse by an economic downturn.    Sound familiar?   Krugman points out that around 60% of the S&L losses occurred in Texas, which amounted to about $75 billion in direct federal aid to that one state. Krugman points out that this aid wasn't in the form of loans that Texas had to pay back, nor did the government assume an equity stake in exchange for the aid; instead this was just an outright transfer of capital from taxpayers to banks and their counterparties in order to bail them out of terrible high-risk investments. $75 billion at the time amounted to 25% of Texas' total GDP. Can you imagine Germany & France agreeing to simply grant 25% of Greece's pre-crisis GDP in Euros with few strings attached? Krugman remarks:   >I think you can make a strong case that if Texas had been an independent country in 1986-87 it would have experienced a huge financial and fiscal crisis.    Indeed. So why did US taxpayers & Congress agree to this massive bailout for a single state? The answer is that they didn't, or not exactly. The bailout was basically automatic, as federal depository insurance corporations and regulators like FDIC, FSLIC, FHLBB and so forth stepped in to stop the bleeding before it could spread into an even wider bank crisis and recession. Later the FTC was created to unwind the accounts of several thousand \"zombie\" banks that collapsed during the crisis.   So one answer to your question is that the US has much stronger & more effective federal insurance provisions designed to mitigate bank failures, as well as other economic (and state budget) crises. In effect, taxpayers stand behind the banks of other states, ready to bail them out should the need arise. Some point out that this backing might create a moral hazard, effectively encouraging banks to make riskier investments because they know Uncle Sam will help them out when their schemes backfire. Others respond that this is the only effective way to stop a banking & liquidity crisis before it can become a full-blown economic depression, and that in exchange for insuring the investments of private banks, taxpayers should demand more effective regulation, accounting standards and stringent lending/investment rules.  **TL;DR -** US taxpayers are in general more willing to be generous when it comes to bailing out the state budgets and local economies of other states -- or at least the structure of federal & state government (particularly for example the power the US Senate gives to small states with low populations) give them little choice. This willingness to help, and a sense of good faith in general, is somewhat lacking in the EU."

Basically, it's a low-level form of political terrorism. Not something which is very useful for international actors in our current global environment."

I give ample citations in that longer response, but in short evidence suggests their are multiple reasons:   1) Self-identity rather than actual actions can be misleading: if you look at what people actually do rather than what they say, they're less different than the look,   2) Supply-side: competition between American religious organizations (rather than the monopoly of European state churches) improved their services,   3) Demand-side: Religion is in part driven by demand, and tends to be most popular among the financially and socially insecure, and the European welfare states reduced that demand,   4) Political identity: in Europe religion was at times close to unpopular regimes which made them unpopular, but also in places in Europe where religion is still popular religion was either opposed to previous unpopular regimes (anti-Communism in Poland and Slovakia). In America, historically religion wasn't tied to politics until the rise of the Religious Right in the 1980's and since then we've religion being slightly more important to those politically right and rapidly (in only 30 years) much less important to those politically left. An effect of \"If that's what religion is, count me out.\" A similar process played in socialist politics in Europe over 100 years ago but is relatively new in the American context.  5) National identity: in some places, to be X means to be Y. Historically, to be a Turk meant to be Muslim (it's how populations of the Ottoman Empire were split in the 1910-1923 period), to be Quebecois meant be Catholic (as opposed to the Protestant-majority Anglos). In Quebec, this was disrupted by the Quiet Revolution of the 1960's and in Turkey, arguably, it's happening since 2002 and the dominance of a mild strain of political Islam. That is, when religion becomes a partisan political identity it can break up religion as a unifying national identity. Arguably, American had being religious (any religion, Protestant, Catholic, or Jew) as a national identity starting in the 1940's and 1950's which increased religiosity and then this has only started to decline again since it began to become a more partisan political identity in the 1970s."

Deutsche became dominant.   Behind them was Dresdner, also very well developed on the retail front and they joined with a UK investment bank,  Kleinwort Benson to form DKB. London was where the IB was happening but the show was sponsored with the money coming from the German retail investors.   There was also Commerzbank which had again a mostly retail operation in Germany but a thriving IB division in London (I forget who they took over). Commerzbank was being chased by DKB.   Finally there was HVB who were again mostly retail but were aggressively chasing IB business.   Along came Lehmann. The point is that many of the IB operations were run at arm's length so it was really a trigger for something that was probably going to happen anyway.   HVB had  big problems and it finally ended up being taken over by an Italian banking group, Unicredit. DKB had big problems but the Germans did not want to lose another major bank so they looked for a partner, Commerzbank to take over but the insurance business from both went to Allianz. Commerzbank was very active overseas but it had to consolidate it's operations. Deutsche had issues with a joint venture with Commerzbank for property investment called EuroHypo which had major problems with mortgage backed securities. Luckily for Deutsche, the venture was majority owned by Commerz so they took the hit politically but financially Deutsche had issues too. Commerz had government support to take over Dresdner but as a condition they had to keep as many German jobs as possible so they also were forced to curtail their overseas activities.   Underneath the big banks are the regional banks. In general they had a good retail base but were under pressure to increase their returns which is why banks like WestLB started playing in London, but without the boards really being aware of the risk that their investment banking activities worked under. Many of them had big issues.  At the same time the EU was applying pressure on the German government to remove the state guarantees for these banks. So the Landesbank were forced to curtail their activities.   Below that were the savings banks. These go down to the size of individual towns or cities. Effectively they their own corporate investment bank that was called DG at the time (it is now DV or something) . This had existed for a while and was not particularly exciting with their risk taking. They survived fairly well.

There are too many factors to consider many factors that could be argued either way.  If some could calculate everything perfectly to find out the overall benefit of purchasing one phone over another, I can guess that the benefit would be so minimal that it would not be worth the effort to actually figure it out.  In order for money to remain in the United States economy, it has many ways to be cycled back in, but I will focus on 3.  Purchasing of products used in manufacturing an item, employment of US workers, and taxes paid to the US government.    First if the purchasing of products used in the manufacturing of an item.  Since it is a smartphone that means that the majority of the products used to manufacture the phone come from all around the world, and very little of those items come from the US.  This means that of all the little parts that are manufactured for smartphones don't benefit the US in their manufacturing.  Neither company benefits the American economy on this front.  Employment of US workers would be another way for money to be retained in the US economy since American workers would pay income tax and purchase goods and services that will perpetuate the movement of money.  Since manufacturing for both phones does not take place in the US that means that neither company benefits the US from manufacturing.  Now Apple claims to have 66,000 employees in the US at of 2015.]  (https://www.reference.com/business-finance/many-employees-apple-b335018ef06d0da4) So that is 66,000 employees that receive paychecks and spend money in the US due to being employed.  [Samsung is a Korean company, but does maintain several divisions in the United States that employ American workers.  Samsung claims to employ 325k employees worldwide.  I can't find how many are employed in the US, but it is safe to say that it is significant.  In order to know which company benefits the US most in terms of employment, we would have to know the total amount employed by Samsung, and the total amount paid in American wages.  Wrapped up into this math is the employment derived from building store locations and other ventures that are hard to account for.  The third is taxes.  Companies have to pay US taxes even if they are not US companies, but there are a lot of loopholes that companies use.  In 2012 Apple paid about $6b in taxes to the U.S. while Samsung paid about $4b.  The problem is that I couldn't tell you the amount of taxes they are going to pay this year, and that would be knowledge needed in order to decide which phone to purchase this year.  There are also several outliers when it comes to figuring this all out.  Apple has made very little in philanthropic contributions, and until recently was know as a company that didn't give charitably.  Apple does pay a higher dividend yield to investors than Samsung, but since it is a tech company it does not have the same loyalty that companies like Pepsi or Disney have, which means lower overall stock value than the actual worth of the company.  You also have to look at the overall benefit of the world economy, because that will have a benefit on the American economy.  Since Samsung employs so many people and does a lot of charitable and environmental work, there is a great world economy benefit that allows for greater overall American exports.  In the end, it is impossible to actually calculate the benefit of purchasing either one smartphone or the other.  If one of these companies manufactured in the US then there would be a clear choice, but with things as they are it is best to just purchase the phone that tickles your fancy."

I've seen many men argue that women just \"get away with crimes more easily.\" But no way in this earthly hell is so many crimes unreported that molestation cases get skewed to 90+% male from 50-50. It would be the number one biggest issue in law right now. It would be a complete failure of the law system that every criminal analyst would able to pinpoint with a spear. I'm not buying that as even 10% of the explanation.  I've briefly researched this for an hour and these statistics basically hold true all over the world. The only category women are overepresended is with crimes related to prostitution (or like things cis men can't do like illegal abortions)  Why are men responsible for close to all crime?

                "content": " This is a complex topic with few strongly established answers (as far as I am concerned). Interest in female offending (more often with respect to the gender gap in offending) has increased substantially over the past few decades, but there are still many unknowns. Before continuing, I invite reading sociologist Kruttschnitt (2013) summary of what research on gender and crime has found (click here).  --- Gender & Gendered differences (socialization, criminalization, etc.) --- Broadly speaking, two popular lines of research concern gendered socialization and differential treatment according to gender. For illustration, I quote criminologist Rosemary Gartner (2011):  >**If the sexes are more alike than different in the nature of their criminal behavior and the factors associated with it, why are they so different in the levels of their offending? One important reason is sex differences in socialization practices and family supervision that encourage conventional behavior among girls and risk-taking behavior among boys** (Hagan 1988). Girls are less likely to engage in delinquent acts because they are socialized to fear risky behaviors, to develop empathy for others, to value close personal and family relationships, and to avoid aggression; and because they are likely to spend more time with family members and other girls who reinforce conventional behavior. In contrast, boys are typically encouraged to value risk-taking, to associate masculinity with physical power and control, and to prize autonomy and independence; and they are likely to spend their time with male peers who reinforce these characteristics. **Delinquent activities for boys then tend to be more rewarding and more affirming of their identities. These tendencies are reinforced as boys and girls move into adolescence and early adulthood, when women\u2019s criminal opportunities are more limited than men\u2019s, and women\u2019s family responsibilities make the costs of crime greater for them** (Steffensmeier and Allan 1996).  The second line of research is concerned with the differences in how men and women are perceived, conceptualized, and treated by society and its institutions. For instance, for crime to happen, you need opportunity (e.g. see Clarke, 2012). Men and women tend not to share the same roles, statuses, lifestyles and routine activities, therefore there are differences not only in socialization but also in crime opportunities (e.g. see historical trends below). There is also the matter of how society reacts/responds to men and women's behaviors (e.g. with respect to the criminal justice system, see the chivalry hypothesis, the concept of judicial paternalism, and the evil woman hypothesis).  --- How the gap varies through time and space --- For a recent illustration of how the sociopolitical context matters, see Savolainen et al. (2017). Analyzing data collected by the ISRD-2, the WVS, and the GII, find that the gender gap in delinquency varies according to differences in national environments:  >The results of our analyses offer qualified evidence that **the degree of patriarchy in a society is in fact related to the gender gap in delinquency.** The results from a series of multilevel regression models showed consistent support for the hypothesis that patriarchal national environment moderates the association between gender and delinquent offending: **The average \u201cmale effect\u201d on delinquency was observed to be the largest among nations that adhere to more patriarchal gender norms and where the position of women in the social structure is the most disadvantaged.** This finding was robust in analyses aimed at examining the hypothesized interaction effect across four measures of both delinquency and patriarchy. In other words, we found a statistically significant and positive cross-level interaction effect in each of the 16 models estimated.  Also see historical research on crime which shows that the gender gap under discussion is not invariant across time. Here is the first paragraph of social historian of crime Van der Heijden's review of *Women and Crime, 1750-2000* (2016):  >**It is generally observed by criminologists that women are responsible for a smaller proportion of indictable offenses than men**: approximately 13 percent of all prosecution in Europe (Aebi et al. 2010, p. 195). **This strong gender difference in criminal behavior is generally linked to the dissimilar public lifestyles of men and women: the fact that women have less freedom and fewer opportunities may cause a lower participation by women in crime and may also lead to more lenient treatment by prosecutors** (Pollak 1950; Adler 1975; Arnot & Usborne 2003; Burke 2006; Silvestri & Crowther-Dowey 2008, p. 27). Furthermore, **scholars generally assume that the sex differences in recorded crime have been consistent across time**, stressing the continuity rather than change in men\u2019s excessive contribution to criminality (Heidensohn 1996; Burkhead 2006, p. 50; Silvestri & Crowther-Dowey 2008, pp. 26, 191). **However, historical data on early modern Europe show that in France, England, and the Netherlands, between 1600 and 1800 women played a much more prominent role in crime than they did in the twentieth century** (Farge 1974; Feeley 1991; Feeley 1994; King 2006; Spierenburg 2008, p. 117; Van der Heijden 2013; Van der Heijden 2014).  And here is part of the conclusion:  >Sociologist Steffensmeier and behavioral scientist Allan argue that scholars should distinguish between the types of offenses committed by women and the explanation for their crimes. They agree that there is variability across time in the female percentage of offending, though such changes are limited mainly to minor property offenses or less serious forms of delinquency (Steffensmeier & Allan 1996, p. 482). **Throughout the period 1600\u20132000 women were most likely to be prosecuted for simple thefts, rather than offenses involving serious violence** (D\u2019Cruze & Jackson 2009, p. 31). **Statistical data on various regions in Europe in the early modern period show that variation in female crime rates was often linked to specific circumstances such as changing moral norms and double standards of prosecutors, as well as to economic marginality and opportunities that were related to migration, family structures, and labor participation.** The data also clearly show that **women were more likely to commit crimes in urban environments than in rural areas.**  Along the same lines, here is the perspective of social historian of crime Greg Smith (2014):  >The greater representation of males among the ranks of criminal offenders is indisputable. **The gender gap has been particularly pronounced for serious violent crimes, but it appears to have decreased somewhat over time because of relatively greater reductions in male violence over the centuries.** For other types of crimes, males also generally predominate; however, historians have been at least as interested in instances where this sex difference is trivial or nonexistent because of what it tells us about variations in the roles, status, and activity patterns of men and women. **In times and places where food and shelter were difficult to come by for some, women showed themselves as willing and able as men to do what was necessary\u2014except perhaps to kill or seriously injure\u2014to survive.**  >What these general patterns and trends obscure are the occasional departures from them in some times and places or for some types of crime. **Historians have revealed a number of these deviations, but more evidence about them could enlighten our understanding of sex differences and similarities in crime.** Furthermore, greater documentation of the extent to which officially recorded crime exaggerates or understates one or the other sexes\u2019 illegal behavior would shed more light not only on the gendered nature of crime but also on the gendered nature of responses to it. For example, **what we know about women\u2019s violence against men** (Cook 2009) **or their involvement in financial or white-collar crime** (crimes for which women were rarely convicted; Palk 2006) **could be greatly enriched by looking at sources closer to the actual behaviors.**  As noted above, scholars have observed convergences in more recent years. Lauritsen et al. (2009) and Rennison (2009) have found a narrowing of the gap in violent offending in the US, and Estrada et al. (2016, 2017) also find a similar pattern in Sweden. These trends seem to be driven by male offending decreasing more than decreases in female offending (i.e. changes in men's behavior more than women's behavior). Beatton et al. (2019) analyzed both violent and property crimes, and find a narrowing of the gender gap in offending among young people in Queensland, Australia. For some of the more popular explanations for these patterns, see Lauritsen et al.'s discussion of their results (click here).  Although further research is needed\u2122, it is clear that the sociohistorical context matters in shaping the extent to which men and women differ with respect to crime.  ---  [Continues below, with regard to research on biological differences between males and females, and a conclusion]"

                "content": " Here's a study that suggests playing violent video games has a desensitizing effect on real world violence, at least in a period of time immediately after playing a violent video game. That doesn't indicate that individuals are more likely to commit violence, though, or that the desensitizing effect is long-term. The study examined 257 college students.  Here's another study from a few years later with similar findings. The study only examined 30 teenage boys, which may not adequately represent the full spectrum of individuals who play video games (all ages, both genders).  It does suggest that there are some physiological or psychological effects to video games that we don't fully understand, even if those effects are not primarily ones that incite or encourage violent behavior.  There are some studies that tie violent video games to increased aggression. Note, though, that this isn't necessarily the same thing as saying that video games incite violence. When we hear someone say \"video games cause violence or increased aggression,\" we tend to think of someone flying off the handle and shooting up a shopping mall. The effects may be far more subtle than that.  For example, \"increased aggression\" could simply mean that an individual who plays violent video games, when presented with a triggering scenario, may respond more aggressively. Example: someone accidentally bumps into you on a crowded street and causes you to step into a puddle. If video games cause increased aggression, we may see statistical differences in the way people who play them respond to this situation than people who don't play video games. They may feel more offended or angry, they may feel more like the action was deliberate, they may curse or shout more often, or otherwise be less likely to shrug it off as a harmless mistake. Those are all emotional responses that we might classify as aggressive, but don't necessarily indicate any intention to cause violence.  That doesn't mean that everyone who plays video games will respond aggressively, or that people who don't play video games *won't* respond aggressively. But if video games cause increased aggression, it may show a statistically significant increase, for example, if we find that people who play violent video games are 17% more likely to react in those ways.  Of course, that doesn't necessarily indicate causation, either. It could be that people who are naturally more aggressive are attracted to simulated violence in video games, and therefore more likely to gravitate towards those games.  Here's a study that found that men who frequently read magazines that objectify women in their content show \"lower intentions to seek sexual consent and lower intentions to adhere to decisions about sexual consent.\" \"The study also found that exposure to women\u2019s magazines was often associated with greater intentions to refuse unwanted sexual activity.\" One criticism of a study like this is that it may not indicate that these magazines cause this behavior, but that men who are dismissive of consent are more attracted to magazines that enforce their views.  We know that dehumanizing individuals often encourages violence against them. This study found that when participants associated black individuals with apes, they were more likely to note a video of a black person being beaten as justified violence. This study also found that descriptive use of words that \"connoted bestial or subhuman\" qualities in articles about death-sentence-eligible criminal defendants was correlated with juries deciding to sentence those defendants to death.  Historically, we've seen numerous other examples of dehumanizing and objectifying behavior being correlated with violence. Nazi propaganda stressed the inferiority of Jews; in Rwanda in 1994, the Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Libre des Mille Collines broadcast media labeling the Tutsi as \"cockroaches\" that should be crushed.  edit: clarity and to address issues regarding my comments on sample size"

She is soon 6 years old. I found her randomly on Facebook and fell in love with her. When I picked her up, her previous owner told me that she does not know much about the cat, as she got it from someone else too and I suppose she didn't care much. Even though her previous owner did not give a flying BEEP about her and allegedly did not know if the cat is vaccinated or any of her medical history, I wanted to save her and give her a permanent home. 4 months went by and I managed to save enough money to get her to the vet and spay her. I took her to the vet and the doctor told me she will give me a call when she is done with the surgery. I leave the vet clinic and as soon as I get home I receive a call from the vet saying that they will not be able to perform the surgery because they found two cysts on the cats abdominal area. The doctor said there is a 90% chance that those would be malignant tumors and the cat has mammary cancer. Of course, I started crying as I grew very attached to the cat in the time I spent with her. The doctor then urged me to make a quick decision as the cat was still under anaesthesia, either sample the tumor to make sure it's malign, go through surgery or put her down. This was a very hard decision for me.   First of all, sampling the tumor or performing the surgery right away would have been extremely expensive and I did not have the money at the time, and second of all, I cannot just put down my cat while I am having a breakdown. I felt like my world fell apart in that moment. Quickly made an appointment at another clinic for a second opinion. I asked the doctor if I have time to start a GoFundMe to get the money as quick as possible and have surgery done and they told me that there is no time and no reason to do that because the cat was still under anaesthesia and I should decide in that moment. If I could go back in time I would tell them how unprofessional it is to make a cat parent go through such a thing. In the end, when they saw that I could not decide as they left me no choice but to put her down in that moment to not 'waste the anaesthesia', they said that there is no point to perform a surgery or sample anyway because there is a high chance that the cat will die under surgery anyway. After hearing this, I cancelled the other appointment check up I had made at the other clinic, as I saw no point in it anymore.   I want to mention that I have nothing against putting down pets, it was just the shock that made me freeze. Incapable of making a choice, I opted to wait for the cat to wake up and to take her home. I rushed back to the clinic and I met the doctor who then advised me to keep an eye out for any signs of illness, as the cat was feeling fine at the time. Doctor gave the cat one month to live... You can judge all you want but I felt it was shocking and cruel to put down a perfectly healthy and happy cat at that time.  As the weeks went by I went through a period of grieving, preparing to say my goodbyes to my sweet little kitty. Spoiled her tons, gave her the space she needed, her favourite snacks...and I waited.  I live in northern Europe where it's extremely expensive to perform surgery, before anyone tries to jump at my neck for not going through with that. Would have costed me about 3300 US Dollars for the surgery, plus an extra 1000 to see if its a malignant tumor, something that my student job would not be able to cover. The check up they did which only included shaving the hair and the anaesthesia costed me 200 US Dollars. I knew this was going to be a very expensive journey and was ready to take out a loan if I could, start a funding campaign, anything. Gave up on the thought because of the vet's advice.  It's been 6 months since then and she is still here. Still normal bowel habits, appetite of an alligator, sociable attitude, pukes once every two weeks and it's always hairballs. And I am wondering, where did me or the vet go wrong here? Is it possible the cat is indeed sick but not showing it? Was it an attempted money grab by the clinic? Could the chest lumps be something else? (I cannot feel or see them anymore as the cat's hair has completely grown back)  TLDR: 6 year old female domestic shorthair cat got diagnosed with mammal cancer, vet did not give her long to live but she is still alive and thriving after 6 months.\n\nAssistant:"

Let me start off by saying that this is not me advocating for people who are not black to be able to say the word with the same levels of liberty as black people (I'll explain why later). Also I must state that I am a person who is a visible minority living in the western world. (I feel like people would immediately dismiss this argument if I was white)  Also for the most part I'm talking about the word ending with an \"a\" not an \"er\" however the same principles apply.  Essentially, banning *anything* completely and punishing people without consideration of context and intention is foolish. (Maybe besides rape because I can't think of a single competent reason why someone would have to rape another person). This includes physical violence and murder. For most instances its safe to say those are wrong, however under certain circumstances, such as self defense, I do not think it's wrong for one to use physical violence and if the situation calls for it, perhaps even murder.   This is true especially for words. Now I understand, if a white person, or any non-black person chose to use the \"N-word\" to address or refer to a black individual over a race neutral word, it *would* be weird. Why would they use the \"N-word\" specifically? Do you want to \"other\" yourself from them? Do you feel ashamed to imply a similarity between you and them? It would be equivalent to a person who addresses back people with \"Hello black guy!\" But when they address people of other ethnic backgrounds they'll use \"Hey man,\" or \"What's up bro?\" There's clearly a mischievous reason for why they would address the black person differently.  However, when it comes to scenerios where the word holds no demeaning or degrading intent at all, such as reading a quote, or a book, or singing a song, there's no reason for punishing the person who said it. Even if the quote/book/lyric was demeaning, it doesn't mean the person who recites it holds those views.  It seems that people who take offense to the \"N-word\" under those circumstances are acting on pure insecurity. The thing is, I would feel the same way. If people used a racial slur towards my race, even when they're singing a song or reading a quote, I'd also feel a little off put. But I know they mean no harm and that I'm only put off due to pure insecurity, and we shouldn't make any decisions based off protecting people from feeling insecure. That's a quick road to hell. Feeling offended is fine, we are able to feel that way for a reason. Feeling offended due to your insecurity is less fine, but still understable. Acting on your offended feelings which stems from insecurity is no longer fine.  Currently, there are certain words that are fine to use that describe people of a certain group. \"Gay\" for homosexuals or \"special\" for mentally challenged children. Whats stopping someone in the future from saying \"the word gay offends me, no one should use it anymore\" despite the fact that it was not meant to be offensive at all. I believe people should at least get to a point where they could hear a word used with no intention to demean and be able to brush it off.  The argument then becomes \"the 'n-word' is inherently demeaning.\" This is more so for \"er\" and not \"a\" since \"a\" is used as a term of endearment for the most part. But YES, it is inherently offensive. Thats why if one is going to use it, they better have a damn good reason for it, but banning it completely seems almost childish. It has an attitude of \"if i dont see it, hear it, or think of it, it doesn't exist.\"   All in all, I can sympathize with the notion that simply hearing the \"N-word\" can make one feel offended. I can feel it too if someone were to use a slur directed at my ethnicity, even with no intent of demeaning me. However, I still don't think that's a valid reason to ban the word completely and scrutinize anyone who says it in a non-demeaning way. I think the current culture of banning the word allows us to accept the notion that \"it's okay to make decisions out of protecting people from feeling insecure\" which is a quick road to hell. It's much better to make oneself strong enough to overcome insecurity than to try and protect oneself from ever feeling insecure. But if someone does use the \"n-word\" for a stupid reason such as to demean someone, they deserve the hate they get.\n\nAssistant:"

Diversity and societal differences should be celebrated, not denigrated.  However, with that in mind, I believe that- in America specifically, with its history of being a \"melting pot\" country- we should not view cultural appropriation in a negative context.   There are a few reasons for this. The first and most pressing to me is that \"cultural appropriation,\" as I understand it, is just the blending of culture- one person likes a certain aspect of a different culture and incorporates it into their own. This trend is replicated across multiple cultures, with multiple people, leading to a blended society. This then, in turn, leads to a very diverse and multicultural society that embraces the cultures and backgrounds of others... right?  Another is that I think the most common examples of cultural appropriation often lead to higher exposure to the aspect of the culture that is being \"appropriated.\" For example, Elvis enjoys gospel/r&b and wants to incorporate it into his music, so he throws electric guitars and hip gyration on it and boom- rock and roll. Black culture is in the mainstream.   Obviously in this specific instance, this was a pre-civil rights era America, and the aspects of black culture that Elvis incorporated were never explained to have originated in black culture. But had this occurred in a vacuum, with societal conditions at the time notwithstanding, I think you could make an argument that Elvis highlighted, rather than appropriated, black culture, leading to further exposure.   So am I way off base? Do I just not understand cultural appropriation as a concept? CMV.\n\nAssistant:"

It's really only championed by people who cannot feel like they can fully embrace the identity of the culture they live in, but who have more in common with the white people of their own country then the POC in their ancestor's country, so they get upset when white people have access to the exact same cultural links as themselves.  Just look at the Kimono Wednesday controversy at the MFA (https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2015/07/18/counter-protesters-join-kimono-fray-mfa/ZgVWiT3yIZSlQgxCghAOFM/story.html) where Asian-American and white women protested letting people try on kimonos.  The Deputy Consul General of Japan in Boston's comment was, \u201cWe actually do not quite understand what their point of protest is. We tried to listen to those people who are protesting, but we think together with the MFA we should encourage that Japanese culture be appreciated in a positive way.\u201d  Japanese people don't care who wears kimonos, because if you are actually Japanese and live in Japan, your connection with your culture is so encompassing and multi-faceted that the idea that kimonos actually represent anything about you is laughable, any more than we would consider blue jeans to represent America.  So, my point is it's not that cultural appropriation is good or bad, it's that it doesn't even exist in a universal sense.  When people claim cultural appropriation, it's more about how they feel about their cultural identity then anything the person is actually doing, so there's no point in arguing with them about it.  You can't logic someone out of a feeling.  Real Problems Include:  Minority intellectual property theft, on the other hand, is a real, serious problem, where a Westerner hears/sees/reads a piece of art/music/writing a POC created and then copies it, maybe making small changes to make it more accessible for white audiences, and claims it as their own without any acknowledgement of its source.  Fetishizing Otherness. So, I actually do have a problem with a sexy geisha or sexy Indian costume, because the West does have a real history of fetishizing other cultures for being exotic, so I do think it's problematic in a way that sexy librarian and sexy firefighter aren't.  There is a difference between wearing a real sarii that comes from the same shop that Indians shop at (at which point it's fashion and fashion is available to anyone) and wearing it like just another piece of clothing (no wigs, no makeup to try to make you seem more Indian) versus wearing a cheap costume where the cut isn't accurate and you put on a wig and eye shadow to stereotype another culture. But that's not cultural appropriation, because it's not appropriating any real culture."

Most of the things required: The prison, the guards, etc, are already needed regardless for people serving shorter sentences.  The final reason is that death is the most extreme end of the punishment allowed in the west. Even where allowed at all, it is usually reserved for the most extreme crimes. If you executed everyone who was sentenced to life to death, you have removed any incentive to not commit worse crimes to cover up others.

This is not a belief I hold because I'm a conservative or libertarian or Republican or whatever (I don't like labels, anyway). I live in Canada, and don't own a gun, so I have no personal interest in this. This is something that occured to me when, in the wake of the recent Oregon shooting, I was researching various mass shootings, noticed something interesting. Especially after the Sandy Hook shooting (for which an assault rifle was used), the conversation was not only that of mental health (which is great and all), but even more so a practical discussion for gun control. Specifically, many talked of banning civilian semi-automatic assault rifles and \"high-capacity\" 30-round magazines. It makes sense, but here's what caught my eye:  The deadliest mass shooting of all time was the 2011 attack committed by Anders Breivik in Norway, on the island of Ut\u00f8ya. In the span of one hour, he managed to kill 69 people and wound 110, 55 of them seriously. This was all done with a .223 Ruger Mini-14 semi-automatic carbine and the 9mm Glock 34 semi-automatic pistol.  Similarly, the deadliest shooting in America was the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, during which Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people and wounded 17 more. This was all done with just two pistols: the 9mm Glock 19 and the .22LR Walther P22. Note that the .22LR round is tiny compared to the 9mm round, and so a .22 caliber *pistol* would probably be the last gun banned if we were to ban all guns.  Columbine High School, 1999. 13 killed, 21 wounded. 9mm TEC-9 semi-automatic pistol, 9mm Hi-Point 995 Carbine, Savage 67H pump-action shotgun, and the Stevens 311D double barreled sawed-off shotgun.  The biggest takeaway is probably the Virginia Tech shooting. It's remarkably deadly considering its humble arsenal. It seems that the type of weapon used has little effect on the outcome of the shooting, with circumstance and police response being more important factors. I mean, if people planning to shoot up a school want guns, they'll get them, legally or not. Even a complete ban of all guns for civilians would do little to curb the black market for guns considering their pervasive use in law enforcement and military alike.  I'd appreciate it if someone were to show me some facts and statistics to prove me wrong with regards to the effect of gun laws on mass shootings and gun violence in general.

The same thing happens on the black-market.  As the guns are no longer manufactured, the existing supply gradually shrinks as guns break or criminals dispose of them after committing crimes.  When the supply shrinks the price goes up and committing gun crimes becomes more expensive.  One of the failings of the pro-gun control group is they either as an error of omission or maybe because they don't realize it themselves but if guns were banned tomorrow, it wouldn't be for many years after that that we'd see a meaningful decrease in black market guns.  Sure a day after a gun ban, only criminals have guns.  However ten years after a gun ban and only a very small minority of criminals have guns instead of a very large majority having them."

Prescribing to my view also means that although I believe in the potential of extraterrestrial existence, any \"evidence\" presented so far is not true or rings hollow in the face of the universe.   * UFO's assume that extraterrestrials need vehicles to travel through space.   * \"Little green men\" and other stories such as abductions imply aliens with similar body setups, such as two eyes, a mouth, two arms, two legs. The chances of life elsewhere is slim; now they even look like us too?   * Urban legends like Area 51 imply that we have taken completely alien technology and somehow incorporated into a human design.   Overall I just think that should we ever face this event, it will be something that will be filled with shock, horror, and a failure to understand. To assume we could communicate is built on so many other assumptions that it feels like misguided optimism.   I'm sure one might allude to cosmic horrors, etc. Things that are so incomprehensible that it destroys a humans' mind. I'd say the most likely thing is a mix of the aliens from \"Arrival\" and cosmic horrors, but even then we are still putting human connotations all over it.   Of course, this is not humanity's fault. All we have to reference is our own world, which we evolved on and for. To assume a seperate \"thing\" followed the same evolutionary path or even to assume evolution is a universally shared phenomenon puts us in a scenario where one day, if we meet actual aliens, we won't understand it all.\n\nAssistant:"

Much, much, much faster. You waste less time, and if taking notes, you can get down much more info.  3: It is far, far easier to edit and revise  4: Your hand doesn't hurt.  5: Typing is standardized, which means it is more legible and also removes the bias some people have against people with bad handwriting.  6: Computer files are much harder to lose, especially if you back them up. They also don't fade over time or get smudged.  Finally, to preemptively take out the \"handwriting aids in retention\" argument, the sheer speed of typing allows one to more accurately transcribe new information with great speed, leaving more time to review.  Note that this only applies to the written word. Clearly, using paper and writing utensils may be preferable if you are painting or drawing or doing some fancy calligraphy.\n\nAssistant:"

I've honestly never understood why ridiculing someone's poor life choices is considered a bad thing. The same goes for people who are anorexic, bulimic, etc. Why is it considered a good thing to encourage people to basically slowly kill themselves instead of make them confront their problems head on?  And I get it, the media is always depicting people that 99% of the population will never be able to look like. That's not what I'm going after. It just seems like that if someone calls a morbidly obese person \"gross and disgusting,\" suddenly that person is an asshole. But is that person not correct? Being fat *is* gross and disgusting. It's not like someone is saying \"all black people are disgusting criminals,\" because that statement that would be racist and entirely untrue. So why are people who tell the truth by calling out fat people for living shitty lives considered to be on the same level as racists?   I mean like, if you get that offended over someone telling you the truth, why not just lose weight instead of complaining? It's really not that hard to lose weight.

That doesn't mean shaming those who are unhealthy.  People who are overweight are aware of that. Many of them are already ashamed. More shame isn't going to encourage them to be better, it's going to make them feel worse. Stress and willpower should be thought of as resources that need to be managed, just like caloric intake. When you add stressors to someone's life, you chip away at their will power and their ability to feel good about themselves. If they have no reason to feel good, they need to do something to escape the crushing feeling of helplessness and negativity. That something is often food. To help people in a healthy way you shouldn't be making them more stressed, you should be encouraging them in positive ways. I suspect though that most people shaming fat people aren't doing it out of genuine empathy or desire to improve the life of the person they're shaming, they're doing it so they can feel superior to someone else.   There are even studies that support what I'm saying.   http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/09/140910214151.htm  > Discrimination against overweight and obese people does not help them to lose weight, finds new research. In a study of 2,944 UK adults over four years, those who reported experiencing weight discrimination gained more weight than those who did not. On average, after accounting for baseline differences, people who reported weight discrimination gained 0.95kg whereas those who did not lost 0.71kg, a difference of 1.66kg.  http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0070048  >  A total of 6,157 participants (58.6% female) completed the discrimination measure and had weight and height available from the 2006 and 2010 assessments. Participants who experienced weight discrimination were approximately 2.5 times more likely to become obese by follow-up (OR = 2.54, 95% CI = 1.58\u20134.08) and participants who were obese at baseline were three times more likely to remain obese at follow up (OR = 3.20, 95% CI = 2.06\u20134.97) than those who had not experienced such discrimination. These effects held when controlling for demographic factors (age, sex, ethnicity, education) and when baseline BMI was included as a covariate. These effects were also specific to weight discrimination; other forms of discrimination (e.g., sex, race) were unrelated to risk of obesity at follow-up. The present research demonstrates that, in addition to poorer mental health outcomes, weight discrimination has implications for obesity. Rather than motivating individuals to lose weight, weight discrimination increases risk for obesity.  It's clear: fat shaming doesn't work."

In developed countries with stable and reliable grids they are rare, but in places where the infrastructure is not really fit for purpose you may end up in situations where there is more demand for electricity than you can supply with the power plants you have.  Normally you have vast interconnected power grids where these things can be even out across many different countries and also have power plants that stand by and can be brought online to make up for the shortfall.  In some cases such as isolated power grids on islands, places with poorly maintained infrastructure and developing countries you may find yourself in a situation where there simply is not more power to be had.  If the operators in this case the operators have a choice. If they do nothing, physics happen, the frequency of the electricity on the grid goes down and either breaks a lot of stuff or causes things to automatically shut down to prevent being broken. This would mean no electricity for anyone for a long time.  The other choice is to cut of some customers until the remaining demand matches what you can supply. Critical infrastructure like hospitals etc and things necessary to keep the grid itself running are not going to be cut of.  You could either pick a neighborhood to have no power for a day or you can pick 24 neighborhoods to have no power for an hour each one after the other to lessen the misery by spreading it around.  That is a rolling blackout. The are that gets blacked out rolls around and affects most people for a short time.  It is not good but better then the alternative.  However many people in many places especially ones where corruption is rampant will pointed out that poor neighborhoods seems to be more likely to be hit by that supposedly equal spread of the blackout.   There are also odd cases like the whole Enron thing in California in the US a while back where fraudsters deliberately caused a problem with supply by shutting down plants that were perfectly fine and thus caused the need for blackouts  to make money. They had manged to exploit the electricity was paid for make money from shortages they cause themselves.  Regulations and oversight prevent that sort of thing in most places though."

Now in someone who's depressed (due to lack of chemicals), their river is barely a trickle, barely enough to support some shrubs and small trees or grasses. What SSRIs (Selective Seratonin Reuptake Inhibitors) do is build a dam in the river. Over time, that small trickle of water adds up and forms a small pond. Now there's plenty of water, and once the pond is established, trees and bushes can grow along the banks and we've got a nice environment going.  But what happens if you tear down that dam? All of the water in the pond rushes away, and you're left with a large, bare area where it used to be. The little trickle of water is still flowing, but it's not enough to fill the pond, let alone to keep the large trees alive. So you have to rebuild the dam and let that trickle of water slowly fill the pond back up, which will take a little while, depending on how much of the water flowed out, or leave it gone and let the small bushes and grasses go back to where the creek flows, which will probably take longer."

Also her mother works at the daycare and may refuse to let me take him.   &#x200B;  My question is what is my legal right to see my son and pick him up from day care if I want to spend time with him while she is at work. And what is my legal right to all the stuff she took from my house?  Also I live in Illinois.\n\nAssistant:"

Getting into fights about picking up your son, trying to outdo each other by beating each other to the daycare, etc., is a recipe for absolute disaster. This can have very bad consequences, and they're entirely avoidable. Here's what you do:  1. Call a lawyer and make an appointment. Do this immediately.  2. Take the emotion out of the situation. Feel free to try to arrange time with your son in the time between now and your meeting with your lawyer, but don't get aggressive about it. \"Hey, I'd love to spend an hour with son at the park so he knows everything is going to be OK.\"   Don't bother taking him out of daycare without discussing with you spouse. This will get cops called, and all manner of nastiness.   3. Protect your bank accounts. This is actually before your calls re: son, but open a you-only account, put your money in it, and switch direct deposit. With your free time, update beneficiaries, etc.   Also, save as much money as possible. Necessities are obviously fine, but you're going to have to come up with cash for the lawyer, and there's going to be a whole lot of looking at your finances.   Finally, no arguing, name calling, or nastiness. You're blindsided and probably angry, but that will only cause you problems. Keep cool, especially for your son. He's going to need a lot of love and support.   Good luck."

Throwaway account because\u2026well, I\u2019m terrified and embarrassed by all of this. Probably going to cross post this, because I really need some advice.   I (29M) had a fling (28F) from 7 months ago, and she just told me that she was pregnant and that the baby is mine. She found out sometime last month, so somewhere around the 6-7 month mark she discovered that she was pregnant. Her due date is at the beginning of March.  I slept with this girl twice, around late May/early June. She told me she had an IUD, and I used condoms. She lives in Oklahoma, and I moved away in the summer to Kentucky.   So basically, I got a text two days ago from her that said we needed to talk. She told me she was pregnant with my child. I tried calling her, but she refuses to talk on the phone, only text. She originally said that she didn't want anything from me, just wanted me to know.   I started questioning paternity and the timeline\u2013how can she just now be discovering she\u2019s pregnant? Hasn\u2019t she had her period? How does she know I\u2019m the father? Can I speak with her doctor? Can I see a sonogram of the baby?   She says that she has bled since we had sex, but that her periods were always light and irregular. So she never suspected anything. She isn\u2019t really showing, but may be growing now, idk. She still lives with her parents and they supposedly still don\u2019t know.   She says I\u2019m the only person she has slept with all year\u2013which may be true, but I know she\u2019s gone on dates since (she was really obsessive and weird, part of the reason I ended things, and after I ended things and moved, she would send me snapchats of her texts/ her on a date with a guy). She is denying my request for a paternity test until after the baby is born.  She says that the doctor won\u2019t speak to me. Idk how she knows this since I just requested it, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that were true. And she has not sent me any ultrasound proof, despite my numerous askings.   I just signed a one year contract with a company, so my life is pretty much locked in for the next 12 months, at least as far as physically moving goes. My work is sending me to Dallas in January, and I have offered to drive to her and Oklahoma to talk and figure out logistics, but she is refusing to acknowledge my offer/ request to meet.  After texting back and forth, she started telling me that she needs my signature to put the baby up for adoption. I told her to send me the paperwork so that I can read over it, but that I don\u2019t want to sign anything until I can prove paternity. Additionally, I want to be involved in the adoption process\u2013but pending paternity results, I want to be prepared to take in the child and raise it myself. I think it's unfair that she has just now informed me about this and I have 2 months to prepare to raise a child that may or may not be mine. I think adoption is great, and there are a lot of parents that would benefit from an adopted child, but I don\u2019t want to burden the system and would like to be a father, even if I have to be a single dad (I\u2019ve told my girlfriend about this situation, and she has been very supportive and is requesting that I steer clear of adoption and raise the child myself. Mostly because she has a half brother that she has never met from her dad\u2019s similar experience, and her dad never tried to be a part of the kids life after adoption, so she doesn\u2019t know who her half brother is\u2026 and it really frustrates her). I\u2019m not sure what Oklahoma laws are for adoption, so any insight would be helpful.   She works in radiology, and has told me she has done a lot of procedures, such as portable CT scans in the OR this summer and fall. She is worried about the health of the baby due to the amount of radiation it may have been exposed to while she was pregnant and working. She says she doesn\u2019t want to do a paternity test before the baby is born because it could affect the health of the baby.   The whole idea of leaving me in the dark about paternity is really frustrating. Her and I slept together twice, both with protection. As a timeline of our relationship\u2013we met on tinder and hooked up. The next day, I got a call from my family saying that my mom was severely injured while on vacation in New Mexico, and I was the closest member of the family, distance-wise, to her. I dropped everything and left the following morning to drive to NM. I have a cat, and I really needed someone to watch my cat while I was gone. After some rapid texts, none of my friends were pulling through. As a last ditch effort, I texted the girl I had just met on tinder and asked if she could cat sit. She said she could, but it would have to be at my apartment. So I gave my keys to a pretty much random person and left in a rush to New Mexico for two weeks, until my mom was stable enough to travel home. I realized this girl was really weird while I was gone, because she didn\u2019t just drop by to feed my cat and leave, she hung out at my apartment for literal hours. When I got home, it was obvious she had snooped through pretty much everything I owned and had read my journals. We had sex one more time when I got back, mostly as a way to keep things cool and  say thanks, but I was already on the outs with her, was planning to, and was forward about my intentions to move back home to take care of my mom. The second time we had sex she held me in as I said I was going to come. I was wearing a condom so I didn\u2019t think much of it, but I noticed after we had sex and I went to the bathroom that she laid on her back and raised her knees up. I have no way of knowing if she tampered with the condoms that were in my bedside drawer for the two weeks I was gone and she was house/ cat sitting. I saw a lot of red flags in her, so I was happy to end things and move away. When I left, she wrote me a huuuuge handwritten letter, and hid it in my suitcase for me to discover as I unpacked, about how she wants to marry me and how I\u2019m her person and how she wants to spend the rest of our lives together, no matter what it takes. I mean, fuck, we only hungout like a grand total of 4 days.   I don\u2019t generally post to social media, but I recently made my first instagram post in like 2 years. It was about my current girlfriend and I\u2019s relationship, a bunch of pictures of us together, and a caption talking about how grateful I am to be dating someone like her. The following morning I got the text from the girl with the news that I may be a father. Merry Christmas, I guess?  Tl;dr  Girl I may have knocked up is refusing paternity test to prove I\u2019m the father, at least until after the baby is born. She lives in Oklahoma and I used to live in OK. She says she needs my signature to sign away the baby for adoption. I may want to keep the child, if they are mine. I don\u2019t trust her, tbh. She is refusing to provide any proof to the existence of her pregnancy. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being manipulated or if I\u2019m going to need to make a large amount of life moves to try and take care of a child, or if I need to consider adoption more seriously.\n\nAssistant:"

I am literally in the middle of a neighbor war.  **Context --** A few weeks back, my neighbor at 4307 who I will call Jane was caught moving my trashcan so it would not be emptied by my neighbor from down the street. She denies it ever happened. She moved it because it was in her handicap parking space on the road in our neighborhood. On the north side of the road where her car is parked is clearly indicated as a 'no parking zone' due to the road's narrow width. Even if it was a parking zone, it's not indicated as being a parking space by paint, or signage as required by ADA compliance.  I went to our city manager asking for clarification if I am placing my garbage can in an incorrect location. She stated that she should not be parking there, and will have code enforcement cite her for doing so. As a result she is now parking in the alley and walking on my property to get inside her home even though she can walk through her own property to get inside it. I have sent her a few messages on facebook asking her to not use my property as a thoroughfare and she wrote back saying she has an easement to the property which my landlord and I have both failed to find any evidence of either verbal or written.   **The Letter --** I got a call from my landlord stating that she sent a letter from an attorney claiming she will sue if we do not comply with things. I have reasons to believe that most, if not the entire letter was written by her due to some peculiar details. Click to view.  Just looking for advice on what I should do to remain out of litigation, and keep her from moving my garbage can, and keep her off my property.\n\nAssistant:"

Can we keep girls against their mom\u2019s will? My husband got a call from his ex SIL last night saying that her two oldest daughters (17 and 14) had taken an uber with their cats and belongings to go stay with their dad (husband\u2019s brother). The girls told their mom that they\u2019re moving in with their dad because of their mom\u2019s boyfriend. Husband\u2019s brother had no idea until husband called to tell him. Husband\u2019s brother and ex SIL had a bitter divorce and are not on speaking terms. Husband\u2019s brother was also not in his daughters\u2019 lives for 3 years while he dealt with his own mental/addiction issues. He has recently tried to make amends and repair his relationship with the girls, but still refuses to talk to or see their mom, so it\u2019s usually us or husband\u2019s mom that must mediate visits as the girls\u2019 mom has full custody. After the girls showed up on their dad\u2019s doorstep, their mom arrived soon after, cops got involved, and there was some arguing between the girls and their mom until we offered to have the girls stay the night with us. We try to stay on good terms with the girls\u2019 mom to facilitate communication with the girls, so she accepted this over letting them stay with their dad on the condition we stay in constant contact with her.  This morning, we asked the girls for specifics on what\u2019s going on and they said that they are fed up with their mom\u2019s boyfriend and he is always yelling at or berating them. They also said he is \u201ccreepy and touchy\u201d. When we asked for specifics, they said he yells at them about not wearing bras. The oldest has mentioned moving out in the past and the mom\u2019s bf threatened \u201cI have lawyers little girl. I will ruin your life so you can\u2019t ever go to college.\u201d He seems to be the most aggressive and cruel to her. The 14-year-old appears to have the worst problems as she doesn\u2019t work like the oldest and is around more. She said he forces hugs on her when she\u2019s not wearing a bra even though she asks him to stop. When she brought this up to her mom, she got annoyed and told her that he\u2019s just trying to bond with her. She said that he grabs her by the waist to move her out of the way even though there is ample room to go around her. Both girls say they don\u2019t feel safe or comfortable in their own home and will stay in their rooms with their ears to the door to make sure they don\u2019t hear him outside before they will leave the room.  They both want to move in with their dad permanently, and their dad wants to take full custody of them. My husband and I said we need to talk to a lawyer and go about this carefully, but with their dad having been out of the picture for about three years, I\u2019m not sure how much of a chance he has. We left a message with a lawyer and expect a call back tomorrow, but I expect we'll have to have a conversation with the girls' mom before then. We also want to discuss grandparent\u2019s rights with the lawyer when we have the chance since husband\u2019s mother has been involved with the girls all their lives and takes care of all their major expenses. The girls\u2019 mom wanted to pick them up today, but we asked her to let the girls stay with us one more night and we can all talk tomorrow. We don\u2019t want to force the girls to go back home with their mom knowing that they\u2019re uncomfortable with their mom\u2019s bf, but I\u2019m not sure we can keep them against their mom\u2019s will if she forces it. I guess what I want to know is, can we tell their mom that we won\u2019t let the girls go back home while her boyfriend is in the same house? Or will this cause us more problems when husband\u2019s brother/mother pursues custody later? The girls have one more younger sister with special needs who is in the house, so we are also concerned for her safety, but the girls make it sound like he doesn\u2019t give her a problem really.\n\nAssistant:"

When i contacted the school to discuss a refund do to an unsafe environment amidst the pandemic and high risk household, they stopped communicating with me. Then beginning at the end of november i saw that they started logging him in and put of activities at school through an app that monitors his day with updates of what he is doing. I have pictures and videos of me and him at my house playing when they are logging him for culircle time or lunch and things like that. I am not certain if this is to try to keep my money and claim that he is attending school or because they are trying to claim he is attending to defraud the govt for funds. I have not yet spoken with the school about the log ins as they seem fairly unwilling to communicate with me after my refund request.  Either way, my question is what agency do i contact to discuss this situation? Is this a covid relief situation where i contact those authorities? Is this a state level funding issue?

They also said it would really be a great help if I hand over any phones, tablets or computers that my son has had access to in the last year, removing any passcode or login restriction.  I was shocked about hearing this. I asked about the incident and I was told that they can't tell me since it doesn't directly concern my son, that they only seek this to see if there has been any mention of it in the communications that my son has had with his friends which might help them uncover some information.  I declined. Told them that I'm happy to talk to them about the incident in person if it concerns my son but other than that this is very unreasonable and really none of our business.

She said that she hopes we're not trying to make this difficult as \"lives are on the line here\", I insisted that I want it for my records. She said they might do that.  So my question is... WTF? They can't be serious about this. My instinct is to get a lawyer if we received anything in writing but really what I'm wondering about is how far can they go in this so-called \"investigation\"? Let's say when school starts, my son takes a phone or iPad to school? Can they confiscate and look through it? Can they force him to reveal the passcode to it or force him to use his fingerprint to unlock? How do I make sure they can't just invade our privacy like that?\n\nAssistant:"
