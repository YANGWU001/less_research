    "\n\nHuman: I am a graduate student who is in desperate need of help (throw-away account). I'll try and give as much info as possible, but mainly I'm just hoping someone has been in my shoes and can help me.  I am a 6th year PhD student in chemistry.  I have passed every requirement throughout my graduate career, but as it stands my adviser (P.I.) is unwilling to discuss anything graduation.  I have met with the dean and she was as unhelpful and non-committal as one could expect from someone in her position.  At this point I don't care about a letter of rec. or keeping any form of a relationship with my adviser.  All I wan't is that stupid piece of paper that says I have my PhD.  I have tried discussing things with my adviser and it turned into a verbal assault in which I stood their and was called horrible names for bringing the subject up (this doesn't begin to describe the level of abuse that my adviser exhibits over myself and other students).  I am most certainly not alone, there are three other students in my lab that are my year and going through the same experiences.    What I am really asking is does anyone know of a process by which I can force my graduation.  Whether it is petitioning or speaking to a certain representative.  The dean that I spoke with said that the only way for me to graduate is with my advisers signature, but I cannot believe that the university does not have a fail safe to protect its students from sociopath professors.  Especially considering I have passed every bench mark asked of me (besides my thesis defense of course).    Any help would be appreciated.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: What would you think and do if a student [30/F] confessed to a criminal history? Hi everyone,  I am a current postgraduate psychology student, and I am training to become a psychologist. I am looking for the perspectives of academics.  I have a complex medical history, and I take multiple medications to manage my health. The university are aware of this. In 2015, the police caught me at the airport in Australia headed for the UK with opioids. I had a prescription, but it wasn't on me. They charged me with unlawful possession of a controlled substance. I went to court with a lawyer, and the charge was withdrawn.  When I applied to become a provisional psychologist, my application was significantly delayed because I had to declare my medical history, incase it was considered an 'impairment'. They were not, however, concerned by my criminal history once they understood the circumstances. I am now a registered provisional psychologist.  I also applied for a Working With Children Check in October last year. They wrote to me and asked me to explain the charges. They said I had no proof that I had a prescription, so they were going to reject my application, but my lawyer and I decided to hire a forensic psychiatrist. He wrote to them, and said I am no risk to children, and I sometimes take opioids to manage severe pain, but I am not addicted to opioids. We sent the report in July, and have not heard from them since.  The university have forgotten about the WWCC, and have organised a placement as a provisional psychologist. I contacted my lawyer, and she said it is illegal for me to commence the placement. WWCC are not answerable to anyone, and are unwilling to provide a timeline.  I think I need to tell the university, but I am nervous. I am worried they will think I am addicted to opioids. I am worried they will think I am lying about my criminal history - because, really, how are opioids related to working with children? I am also worried they will think the reason my registration took so long to process was because of my history. Ultimately, I am worried I will lose my place in the course.  What are your thoughts? What should I do?  Many thanks in advance.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Cheating in STEM specifically is so rampant and widespread that I doubt anyone could ever put a lid on it.  I know many, many students who had very high GPAs, but also had all the previous midterms, assignments and labs.  I'm not a PhD candidate, just an engineer who at 32 is considering doing a masters because my deteriorating health condition. Id like to see professors be more practical and encourage the use of resources while test taking and studying. This is how it is in industry. The way these programs are structured, it is impossible to retain the vast majority of information as an undergrad.  Much like we rely on calculator functions, it would be interesting to see how people faired if instead professors taught students how to navigate tools like textbooks effectively and disseminate relevant information instead of saying \"study 6 chapters for the MT\". This approach of getting people to study everything is dumb, and often times ensures the greater picture is missed.  Myself, who did not cheat earned a mediocre B average (though I battled mental and physical illness/didn't apply myself quite the way I wish I had until my last year).  The entire system needs an overhaul IMHO. In North America, we reward those already doing well with scholarships and job placements, earned legitimately or not. It is unfair/unhealthy competition. If they're getting rewarded for it, most people level the playing field by following suit and accessing old assignments and web resources as well. It is almost human nature.  You could even argue that since large amounts of monies are paid, youre getting the degree however you have to, rather than pay again (or a third time!) for the same course. Maybe cheating would be discouraged of you could take it again for free? I don't know, just brainstorming.  Let's call a spade a spade. If an instructor were adequate, people wouldn't be relying on chegg and coursehero to pass (controlling the student variable by assuming they're at least semi indelligent/capable), leaving with subpar comprehension.  I'll be real with you: nearly every student has those tools in STEM. Every.one.of.them.

He would always eat lunch in my room and was one of those kids we had to drag across the finish line to graduate. I felt a lot of guilt because after he graduated he would message me on social media to chat, but I never really felt comfortable with talking online. In hindsight, he was clearly very lonely and needed someone to talk to. I wish I had recognized it then, but I didn\u2019t. I tried to channel the guilt I felt by telling myself I\u2019d do better for the next student who needed me, but this didn\u2019t really help resolve my pain. The pain is still there nearly five years later, but it\u2019s not nearly as acute as it was for this first half a year.  If you get the chance, attending a funeral was helpful for managing my grief. The first student did have a funeral and I felt a lot more closure being able to spend time with other members from our school community. The second student didn\u2019t have a funeral, and it seemed like it was more difficult to resolve my grief without the social/ceremonial aspects of saying goodbye with others.

Fast forward to today, I have already accepted a TT position and suddenly find myself on the other side of the table -- recruiting students, planning for independent grant applications, etc., which are all very new to me. So, I come back here with a few questions on grad student recruitment:  1) How do you attract grad students to work with you as a new PI? This year is particularly tricky for me because I am not listed on the department's website and do not yet have a functioning lab. I see a few good applicants whose research interests overlap with mine, but they applied to work with other professors in the department. My future colleagues are okay with them working with me. In this case, do you have any suggestions on how I should reach out to the applicants and present myself as a potential alternative advisor?  2) I understand that students are still learning (so am I!) and may face challenges in their lives, and it is my job to support them and help them grow. However, I have also heard some bad stories from my colleagues about their students/trainees. (By \"bad stories,\" I am not talking about regular difficulties but the more extreme cases, like academic dishonesty, toxic personality, and extreme procrastination/stubbornness that significantly delays project progress, which can be detrimental to a new lab.) So, in your experience, at the stage of reviewing applications/interviewing applicants, what are the ways to identify red flags/potentials of the student? Thank you!\n\nAssistant:": {

I'm 25 (f) and not in my doctoral program yet, but despite this I got a lot of 'wiggle room' in my role as a junior lecturer- I got to design and teach my own undergraduate course in my discipline and was able to teach first-year master students as well (again in my area of interest which is African gender studies).

How does it read on an academic CV?   I also got an offer to lecture full time in a masters program around African Studies and Global health, which I have not yet declined.

    "\n\nHuman: Will having a baby during grad school interfere with getting a post doc when I'm done? Hi Everyone. I'm a \\~30 yo female PhD candidate in Canada starting my 4th (and hopefully final) year of a field-based program. I've been recently pursuing post doc positions for when I complete my degree and have had some interest from potential advisers. My concern is that my husband and I have been seriously discussing having a baby within the next year. This is something I have wanted for a couple years now, and I have finally wrapped up the majority of my field-based research. However, I'm worried that having a baby at this point will mess up the connections I've made re. post doc positions. I'm guaranteed funding during parental leave for at least a year from my uni, my husband is also able to take parental leave (he's a post doc) and I strongly believe both my adviser and his would be supportive during that time. I'm concerned that nobody will want to take me on as a post doc with a young baby in tow, especially if that baby delays the start time of the position or any potential field work. I'd like to think that any potential adviser worth working with would be supportive and understanding, but it still worries me a lot. Does anybody have any relevant experience? I am looking for similar stories, support from colleagues, and some advice. Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to reach out!   PS. throw away account in the off chance my real account is known to colleagues and collaborators\n\nAssistant:": {

Numbers beyond 80kya aren't usually rejected because of anything particular to American archaeology, but because they precede the emigration of modern human lineages from Africa. Steeves presents sites like Pedra Furada, excavated by Niede \"occupation-of-the-Americas-could-go-back-100,000-years-and-the-first-settlers-'might-have-come-not-overland-from-Asia-but-by-boat-from-Africa\" Guidon, are presented as certain fact. It's indiscriminate and uncritical.  At the same time, the parts I've read do not engage well with current discussions of human presence in the Americas. Clovis-first is quite decidedly dead for all but the most stubborn defenders, and has been for at least two decades. Discussing refusal to acknowledge pre-Clovis sites as a contemporary issue, rather than in a historical overview, feels inappropriate in 2021. The introductory preview for the book attacks the word \"Caucausoid\" as if any American archaeologist has said that word in the current century.  It's difficult to look at Steeves's critiques and then look at the response (in my circles at least) to the footprints found recently in New Mexico and feel like it's the same group of people.

    "\n\nHuman: How long does it take to learn a completely unfamiliar language through full immersion without any common language or previous contact.  You sometimes hear accounts of sailors, missionaries, anthropologists and such who go to live among people  with entirely foreign languages. If there is no common language how long is it likely to take to learn. I recall hearing about a guy by the name of Jack Renton who was a castaway who lived among the Lau at first as a slave but later marrying into them. By the end he apparently knew their language well. Is there any research or accounts on how long this process might take in such a situation where there is no common tongue and what it involves that you could direct me to?. How quickly (weeks months years) is it likely to take to make progress and what factors might be important. Asking as research for a story I am writing.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Awesome, something I'm semi-qualified to talk about.  In a case of full immersion where you are totally cut off from your native language, you will start to have the basics in a few weeks, be minimally conversant in around a month and should be able to hold a decent conversation in 6-8 weeks.  Fluency will depend on your commitment, willingness to study and natural ability but will come in around 4 months to a year, assuming sustained no contact with people who speak a language you speak.   ANY contact, even extremely limited (5-10 minutes a day) with a language you speak will delay this schedule. This is because humans are social creatures with an intense desire to communicate, and so in a case of total immersion in a foreign language, that intense need to communicate will highly motivate you to learn. Satisifying that need even a little with your native language (or any language you speak well) will reduce the visceral need to learn the new language, having a huge impact on progress.   Strategies to accelerate acquiring a language include:  - Learn the 100 most common words in a language. Memorize them, make sure you recognize them when spoken and as quickly as possible, learn to use them including their conjugations. Even better if you do this before arriving.   - Learn a semi-complex sentence like, \"I need groceries, so I am going to to the store to buy milk and bread.\" Get a native speaker to help you develop this single sentence into every possible form. Switch the tenses, switch \"I\" to \"you, he, she, they, it\", formal and informal etc. Memorize these forms to build a basic familiarity with the grammar. Refer back to this early on.   - Spend as much time around children as possible. This is a big one for two reasons. One, kids tend to talk about the here and now,  basic needs and desires and their immediate environment more, generally speak about simple things and thus help you build the basics faster. But actually more important, kids will laugh at you when you make mistakes, and if you ask kids to correct you, they will. Adults will instinctively ignore your mistakes as long as they understand you. (One of the reasons kids learn language so fast is because other kids are better natural teachers.)  - Play games that involve speaking with native speakers as much as they'll let you. Card games, board games, dice or domino/tile games etc. Any game that involves lots of socializing and conversation. (The super bonus ultra secret level is role playing games. If you can find a D&D group in that language to play with, you'll be completely fluent and even reading in 3-4 months or less. I'm not exaggerating here at all.)  - Socialize, preferably with alcohol, especially in weeks 3-6. There is a natural phase of language learning that comes as you've started to comprehend well enough to understand a good chunk of what you hear, but it can be hard to start to form sentences. Language teachers often call this \"the silent period\" (and it's worse for shy people). Getting past this and starting to try to speak really helps you learn, and so relaxing (or lowering your inhibitions with a few drinks) can really help you break through this phase.   - Finally, and obviously, in the first month or two, do absolutely everything possible to avoid any languages you speak. This includes reading, radio, movies etc. You will start to crave hearing a language you understand. Don't give in, nothing will fuel your development faster than the need to communicate.",

So far, I know I need: -sunscreen -repellent -water -food (snacks and lunch) -hand sanitizer -phone (to be stored carefully in a protective case) -sunglasses -hat -buff (to cover hair/neck) -mini first aid kit -wallet -toilet paper/wet wipes (because this is a very primitive site and there are no facilities.....considering a Shewee or something similar)  The site director is providing dig kits with tools, paperwork, and writing implements (he is very particular). What other items or clothes make it easier to be out in the field?  What type of shoes do you use? Boots? Combat or hiking? Low top or high top?  Thanks!\n\nAssistant:": {

In a certain sense, that\u2019s just where it happened; that\u2019s where all the right variables and factors aligned to produce the specific outcome. It goes without saying thats where our ancestors were (where they evolved), so that obviously paved the way for humans. Homo sapiens are part of a long chain of the Homo genus, most of which happened to be present in and around Sub-Saharan Africa. Homo sapiens began as a small band that became more successful over time, ultimately outperforming members of its same genus. It would\u2019ve been impossible for groups of sapiens to spawn simultaneously around the globe because the exact same ancestral chain would\u2019ve also had to exist in other continents.   All continents, while wildly different, also have many similar climatological and geological characteristics across space, so I\u2019m not sure there are any profound arguments as to what makes that region particularly special (I could be wrong). My understanding of human migration is we originated in East, Sub-Saharan Africa (conducive to any life with its diversity of flora and fauna, as well as the accessibility of water) and subsequently migrated out of Africa to modern day Asia, over the Bering Strait and into the Americas. Although as of late, the Bering Strait Theory has come into major question, newer theories of human migration into the Americas would still follow the same sort of patterns, but would include the use of maritime technology that was previously considered nonexistent for that respective time period. The great thing about Anthropology  and Archeology is there are always new discoveries that transform our own history, and who knows, maybe one day we\u2019ll learn how humans actually originated in South America or something.

Honestly I would have to spend a ton of time to write out anything and because I am not an expert on this would probably get things wrong.  I will recommend some books from when I studied this back in school though.  The Transformation of Intimacy by Anthony Giddens  and (small parts from)The Origins of Sex  If you are looking for something a bit freeer I believe the History Channel is running a series on sex in history but I don't know how good that may be.  My $0.02 is that a great majority of our current views were likely formed around the time of the Reformation when the Christian religion was spiting up and reforming itself.  And that would be a good time to look into to see where things started, but that is only a mildly educated guess.  Edit: assuming by modern you mean Americas/Europe.  If you mean everyone then see the above but about 100X more complicated."

    "\n\nHuman: Using chocolate pudding for a cake layer &#x200B;  I am making a chocolate cake and want to use chocolate pudding in between the layers.  I usually make the Hershey's pudding recipe on the container of cocoa powder.  Do I need to make it thicker?  If so, how?  Is there anything special I need to do so the pudding doesn't make the cake mushy?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " You have a few options here, depending on how advanced you want to get with technique.   One comment suggested adding chocolate to the pudding, giving you more of a pudding-ganache than a true American pudding. It\u2019s not a bad idea. It will change the flavor quite a bit, depending on the type of chocolate you use. Too dark and you flirt with bitterness/richness, not dark enough you run the risk of it being too sweet.   Next you have the option of gelatin! A little unflavored gelatin goes a long long way.   You could use agar agar, which frankly is the route I would pursue. Similar to gelatin in many ways, a little agar goes even further than its unflavored gelatin cousin. I prefer it because it\u2019s more temperature stable than gelatin (agar\u2019s melting point is 185\u00b0F/85\u00b0C vs gelatin which is somewhere around human body temp). You can buy it on Amazon.   I\u2019m worried I\u2019m rambling. I\u2019d be happy to provide more info if you\u2019re interested in the wide world of agar agar.",

    "\n\nHuman: What are some alternative garnishes to add to hot chocolate bombs other than marshmallows? My partner LOVES hot chocolate and I'm making her some hot chocolate bombs for Christmas. Unfortunately, she does not like marshmallows as they make her stomach go. This sucks because I think part of the fun of hot chocolate bombs is seeing them open up and release marshmallows! I was thinking some sprinkles, but they are a bit underwhelming. I would appreciate any ideas for garnishes that can float or add to the experience.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: A pastry/bread a day! (Would like some suggestions) Hi as the title says I\u2019m going to be attempting for the next 2~3 weeks to make a new pastry or bread a day. Decided to do this since I\u2019ve been sleeping really early recently & waking up around 4-5am & I also got some new kitchen equipment. But really I would just like to start practicing how to bake different things as I am trying to hopefully find a job in a bakery soon within the next month or so.  What I would like help with is coming up with some ideas for what I can make, I mainly love to make bread so some sweet little bread recipes or any kind can help me. For pastries I haven\u2019t done too much of those honestly so Wednesday I\u2019m going to be attempting to make some Macaroons for the first time.  For now the only recipes I can come up with to make are things I make all the time, so if you guys could share some recipes with me or some ideas so I can try them that\u2019d be very much appreciated, thanks!   What my first week looks like: -Milk Bread (Mon) -Baguettes (Tues) -Pizza dough (Wed) -Sour dough (Thurs) -Croissants (Fri) -Macaroons (Sat) -Cannolis (Sun)  But I don\u2019t mind replacing anything from Tues-Thurs with a different recipe as I\u2019ve made everything but macaroons & cannolis a lot. Again, thank you & sorry for the messy rambling of a post \ud83d\udc12\n\nAssistant:": {

Now, I am not the most experienced baker, I pretty much do the same recipe: https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/easy-white-bread  Its always a success, and I enjoy it. However, I haven't got enough bread flour to make a loaf. So, what are my options, can i use the remaining bread flour and mix it with self raising? Are there any other bread recipes for plain/self raising flour?  Would be great for any advice.  Cheers\n\nAssistant:": {

I bought this pack of chicken breasts (my hand for scale). https://imgur.com/a/4ArIB  I also really like the sauce from this recipe. http://www.budgetbytes.com/2016/07/sticky-ginger-soy-glazed-chicken/  The last time I tried buying chicken and following that recipe, I had a difficult time and had to pay a lot of attention to the chicken and ended up burning it as well. I think it would be A LOT easier if I could put the chicken in the oven, set a timer and forget about it. I'm very new to cooking and unsure what the best way of doing that would be, and how/when to add the sauce. I figured I would ask people who are a lot better at cooking than me for advice.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Why do my pork chops always come out tough from a pan? Background: I used to cook pork chops, chicken breasts, and steaks on the grill. They\u2019d come out pretty tender and juicy. I can do a steak in a pan and regularly do chicken cutlets with great success, but my pork chops are always tough.   I\u2019ve tried using a cast-iron and a stainless steel pan, both over medium heat (5 on my electric range), my pork chops marinated or have tried basting them with butter and seasonings. I\u2019ve let my meat sit out for half an hour to come to room temp so they don\u2019t cup as badly.   All of this and my pork chops are still better as dog toys. Any advice would be deeply appreciated.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Spatchcock vs In Pieces Turkey hi r/askculinary. Trying to plan out Thanksgiving turkey and have come across 2 methods that claim to make better turkey than roasting it whole. Spatchcocking and Roasting in Pieces.   Now I almost never work with whole poultry. My experience is usually with pre-cut pieces like thighs, drums, and breasts. That being said, I agree that these 2 methods seem better than roasting the whole bird. But Thanksgiving can be hectic enough and I cook it solo, so the less chaos/unpredictability the better.  What method would you say is easier, spatchcocking and cooking in pieces? Both involve some initial cutting of the raw turkey and I dunno which is better as a starting spot for an amateur cook.  Far as I can see, the advantage to spatchcocking is that the bird remains as one cohesive thermal unit so it roasts evenly; and that you can do it at one time with one uniform temperature for the whole bird. The downsides to spatchcocking seem to be cutting out the backbone - not sure if my kitchen shears are sharp enough, they might be but I've never tested it out. Also when you pull the bird out at 150F internal breast temp, the leg meat remains kinda pink even after resting. I know it's cooked and safe to eat, but my family will freak out at pink poultry meat and claim it's uncooked. We've gone to war over pork meat like this and it's ruined more than one meal in the past.  For roasting in pieces, the upsides seem to be that I can more precisely control the internal temps of the turkey pieces to be exact for each part of the bird (nobody screaming at me over pink meat). The problem is that it requires even more initial carving than spatchcocking, and although I know my knife is sharp enough to make those cuts, I have little experience carving whole turkey. Additionally I would guess that the dark meat and white meat need to be cooked at different oven temperatures for optimal results and thus finish at different times, so I need a good way to keep one warm while the other cooks.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanksgiving is maybe my favorite holiday and I've recently gotten into cooking, so I want to do as good a job as I can.\n\nAssistant:": {

Here's a video demoing it. You can do a better job than them by not playing with it as much (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9WzDGMTr10)   The acid helps prevent gluten formation because gluten is a protein and as a protein, it sticks to itself and other things well in a pretty neutral/slightly acidic environment. The vinegar lowers the pH just enough so that the gluten doesn't have a chance to stick to itself and other ingredients as well, and stay by itself.    You don't want too much gluten, because that's how your dough becomes chewy and hard and not flakey and light.",

Sorry mods if this is not acceptable and remove if necessary. ______  Several years back I made a few posts on r/AskDocs aka \"Ask A Doctor\" looking for help with symptoms that had been getting progressively worse for a few years. They were quite detailed and each time I got a little bit of basic advice and suggestions but nothing that helped resolve or figure out the issues. I delayed going to a doctor and then even when I did, I downplayed the symptoms.  I deleted most of the posts for privacy reasons after advice was sought and received but the last one I posted remains (it got no responses and was specifically about flushing and did not contain some of the other symptoms so I didn't think to delete it)...   https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/69w3ai/flushing_tingling_of_face_and_body_help_please/  It is not the best representation of the help I was seeking but I figured I would link it.  ____  I finally sought help from a specialist a few months after that and after plenty of testing and multiple referrals, I was diagnosed with Stage IV Neuroendocrine cancer and Severe Carcinoid Syndrome. It was bad enough progressed that I was told by the doctor team and surgeons who initially treated me after the diagnosis, that they were shocked at my condition and were surprised I had not had either a heart attack or liver failure yet. One doctor even stated that if I had kept going without seeking help I would have been dead within 6 months for sure.  While the situation is far from resolved (I have gone through multiple surgeries and treatments since) and while there is no cure or resolution currently, I am now way better off than I was before and am a research patient contributing to cancer research for young Neuroendocrine patients. I may be dealing with this the rest of my life but I am alive and contributing to research that may help others.  ____  I post this because I want to make it clear that /r/AskDocs is great as a sounding board and to get general advice but it is no substitute for actually seeing doctors and pushing for help. One of my first posts someone stated that I should push my doctors on the matter if I was that concerned. I wish I had done exactly that sooner. Instead, I kept seeking advice on r/AskDocs, and downplaying my situation in the real world.  I read a lot of posts on this subreddit and often see people seemingly dismissing going to an actual doctor or stating they don't think it is helpful and expecting the subreddit to figure out their problem. If you do not trust your doctor find a new one, but please folks, SEE A REAL DOCTOR FOR YOUR ISSUES. And PLEASE communicate fully and don't downplay things. This subreddit may help you get ideas for questions, and maybe even find possible solutions, but it is NOT a substitute for a real doctor.   Take my case as an example. I delayed and delayed, and kept posting on this subreddit hoping for answers and while I did see real doctors, I did not push my situation or give as much detail as I should have. I downplayed it and figured that if no one on /r/AskDocs seemed to know what it was, it probably was not serious.  How wrong I was.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: I have a very rare version of a very rare disease. I'm finding it harder to cope as time goes on and I can't find anyone who has gone through the same thing. I don't know what to do. Good morning and thank you for any replies in advance. Basic medical info is below.  25F, 5'0\", 120lb, half Japanese/half white, located in Philadelphia, less than a pack a day smoker, I use medical marijuana, never drink. Existing conditions are idiopathic hypersomnia, depression, anxiety, c-ptsd, and Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease. Current medications: trintellix 10mg, lamotrigine 100mg, vyvanse 60mg. I also just had two 5-ish hour IVIG infusions last week.   I was diagnosed with Kikuchi Fujimoto disease in December 2020 after being sick since February 2020. I had gone through many specialists and finally got a 2nd opinion  and diagnosis from a whole team of specialists at Penn. I am currently treated there in the oncology department.   This disease is apparently pretty rare, and usually sorts itself out within 6 months. Unfortunately I did not get better on my own and thus have been feeling sick for a year now. My symptoms are swollen lymph nodes, drenching night sweats, nausea/vomiting, a plaquey rash on my back, weird blood work, really bad fatigue, abdominal pain, weight loss, and I run a low grade fever every day. I did a month of a really high prednisone taper, as soon as I stopped all my symptoms came back. I did two long IVIG infusions in the hospital last week but so far I haven't noticed any improvement. My doctor told me that he has seen a few patients with this before and has had success with an infusion called Rituxan, but as of now my insurance is denying it and its far too expensive to tackle out of pocket. The reason the insurance is denying the rituxan is because this disease is so rare there's very little literature or research on treatment already.  I trust my doctor and I have faith that their team is doing all they can for me in terms of care and also trying to get me the Rituxan for free. I feel unwell most of the time and while I think I've done a pretty good job of keeping it together for the last year, It's starting to become a struggle to keep going. I can't find a single other human who can relate to what I've gone through. I almost feel like an imposter because I'm treated in the oncology department because what I have is cancer like, but not cancer. A stupid part of me is afraid I'm taking time and resources away from cancer patients during a global pandemic and maybe I should just be suffering and hope eventually my symptoms resolve. My thoughts are veering to a dark place. I am not afraid to die but I am afraid to live like this, constantly feeling ill. I sent a message to my care team this morning asking if there's some kind of special therapist who deals with rare diseases or difficult diagnoses but I haven't heard back just yet. I have a therapist who I speak to every other week, but I want to talk to someone who deals with this more often.  How can I find someone, a patient or a counselor, who can relate to me? I can't find online forums for Kikuchi Fujimoto disease. Is a rare disease counselor even a thing? Have you had patients with super rare conditions? How did they cope? I always put on a happy face when I go to Penn because everyone there is always so nice to me, should I be more open about my despair?   Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: I swear a hair grew out of my tongue once but everyone thinks I'm insane 36f USA 5'7 not sure how much I weigh.  No relevant medications or medical conditions.  This is really just a question I never thought to bring here until right now, when my phone decided a news byte I needed was someone growing hair out of their gums.  Which reminded me of something that happened ages ago that I've never found an answer for.  When I was a kid, a hair fucking grew out of my tongue.  Towards the back, too far for me to really reach.  I discovered it when it got tugged by my back teeth.  Screamed my head off; still remember how much it hurt.  My grandparents were watching me at the time and they were just like \"...what the fuck is this child's damage?\"  I reached far back enough to try and feel around, and the end broke off (you know how it does when you use tweezers, and you don't get the root, but the hair breaks off?) just a bit, but enough to confirm that yes, this was a hair.  However, I realized that convincing people that there was a hair growing out of my fucking tongue was going to be an uphill battle, so I resolved to deal with it.  I have no memory of what happened after that, but I assume it didn't bother me again because I surely would've lost my resolve if it had; the pain was intense.  I also remember the explanation I came up with as a kid: I must have eaten something that cut my tongue and somehow it scabbed over and trapped a hair I'd accidentally gotten in my mouth.  In hindsight that seems only slightly more likely than a hair actually growing out of my tongue, but it was far less terrifying, so I went with it.  Except it happened again.  Not sure if it was when I was a teen or a young adult; old enough to take the pain of it without losing my shit, but long enough ago that I can't place it on any sort of timeline.  Same thing happened; enough of the end broke off that it stopped getting snagged and never bothered me again.  Honestly?  While I always remembered it, I'd assumed for a while that it was just one of those weird kid memories you eventually realize didn't actually happen.  Sure I could remember it clearly but I can also clearly remember things I know I'm not remembering correctly.  And hair just...doesn't grow out of the back of someone's tongue.  But the second time I was well past the age for that.  No matter how much I google, I only get results for the disgusting but irrelevant condition colloquially known as \"hairy tongue.\"  And one site that claims to have medical photos of hair growing out of tongues, but one looks photoshopped and the other one looks like a dog with stitches in its tongue.  And a lot of dream interpretation sites. I'm fully expecting any responses I get to accuse me of making shit up (to what end, I don't know) or misremembering, and I get it.  I'm just hoping someone here will say \"Oh I heard of that happening to a guy\" or whatever.   Hell, at this point I'll take \"Sometimes people with X disorder have vivid hallucinations of hair growing out of their tongue.\"    This has been bothering me for 30 years.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: F(24) Is this standard procedure or was I taken advantage of? Or am I overreacting?? (Possible TW?) I was really sick with a bad cough so I went to the doctor to get checked out. They wanted to see if it was pneumonia so they took me to take an x-ray. I\u2019ve had x-rays on my chest many times before so I knew I had to take off my bra. That alone makes me really uncomfortable, but I\u2019ve always pushed through for this purpose. For context I HATE my body showing. I panic at the thought of people seeing me nude, and yes, it does get in the way of medical exams. This particular time when I was getting an x-ray, after I had taken my bra off from under my shirt they wanted me to take off my shirt as well though. That\u2019s never happened before. (It was just a basic graphic tee. I\u2019m almost positive I\u2019ve worn that same shirt before for an x-ray) They wanted me to stand in this room naked from the waist up. It was a male nurse, which was hard enough, but honestly it wouldn\u2019t have mattered for me if they were female. I said \u201cI don\u2019t have metal or anything on my shirt. I\u2019ve never had to take it off before\u201d but I was already panicking and kind of shutting down. My response to things that make me uncomfortable is to freeze. He just repeated \u201ctake off your shirt.\u201d And he started walking over to me. My arms were crossed over my chest and he reached down, grabbed the bottom of my shirt and forced it off of me. I was hyperventilating at this point and crying very obviously, but he just told me to move over to the x-ray board. I did what he asked and let him move me in the position he needed me in, but I hated every moment. At one point he said \u201cStop crying. You\u2019re okay\u201d in a very annoyed voice and he kept looking at me like he was irritated. Even rolled his eyes numerous times like I was being completely unreasonable of a patient. This happened a little over a year ago and it still effects me. Like I\u2019m shaking just typing this out. Especially going to doctors now. Thankfully there is no way for me to ever go back to that clinic as I don\u2019t live there anymore.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Infant girl three weeks of age has had two choking incidents , one of which made her spend her first Christmas in hospital. Bit of a heavy one here, but I NEED advice. (Also sorry for the spelling and grammar I\u2019m not the smartest when it comes to that stuff.)  So on the first of December I gave birth to the most beautiful baby girl. She weighed 6lbs 2oz and was the picture of health and happiness. Everything was going perfect until the end of her first week of life , I looked down at her and she was red and wide eyed and flopping her head around in distress... I realised she was choking, I scooped her up and when she was up right and had a few sharp blast to the back vomit started to come out of her nose and mouth, she started crying when the vomit started gushing so I knew that she could breath again. Now this whole incident only last in total 5-8 seconds, but it really shook me. After she was better I was so relieved but I was immediately worried it was going to happen again so I asked my partner/ mum/ partners mum and dad/ friends who are parents / doctors/ midwife/ health visitor and they all pretty much told me it would be fine and she would have cleared it herself if had of been asleep or not watching her because \u2018that\u2019s how babies are designed \u2018 , but they didn\u2019t see it , they didn\u2019t see the fear in her eyes and how she was acting. It was honestly so frustrating to not be listened to or taken seriously about this of all things. Nevertheless even though it went against what I believed, I listened to them and settled myself and made myself chalk it down as a freak accident and told myself that she would have been fine if I hadn\u2019t of helped her.  Fast forward to Christmas Eve and me and my partner where just about to go to sleep, I was actually already drifting off and he screams she not breathing, it was happening again but this time it was way worse , she was wide eyed again and flopping about in distress but this time when she was sat up and patted on the back nothing was happening and she started moving a lot less and her eyes closed, she was starting to turn purple, basically she was about to choke to death. Thankfully after the last time I watched some infant first aid videos, so i asked my partner to hold her head down and I opened her mouth and stuck my finger in and hooked the thick liquid stuff that was in the throat and started pulling it out, she let of one little tiny cry so I knew it was working to some degree so I ran into the kitchen and got the mucus sucker and with one hand used it on her nose and the other hand to hook the stuff out of her throat again . Finally she cried a few times and began to breath and even though she was foaming at the mouth and very weak I could tell she was atleast breathing again , this whole incident last 40 seconds. Once we got her breathing again we called an ambulance, they took her in to hospital and observed her for a while and advised on some changes in food (both the amount and type) and said she should be fine.  Now here\u2019s my problem, everyone said she was fine the first time too, but clearly it happened again and to a much worse degree!  Now me and my partner are taking full shifts so she is always with someone who is awake and fully alert, which is fine but I can\u2019t relax, I spent eight hours solidly just staring at her watching her breathing and panicking every time she moved or made a noise. I genuinely don\u2019t know how I am meant to cope with this fear that she is going to die any second, I can\u2019t enjoy any time with her because I\u2019m so stressed even though I want to be able to enjoy being with her I just can\u2019t over the past few days. I don\u2019t know what to do , does anybody have advice or has anyone been through similar experience?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Chances of recovery from 30% lung capacity - COVID Age: 40 Sex: Male Height: 6'2 Weight: 275lbs  Hey docs,  My girlfriend's father is currently in the hospital for \"suspected\" coronavirus. He's been sick for just over a week now and has been drastically losing the battle.   He's a healthy 40s non-smoker with no known underlying health conditions. He is slightly obese but in a healthy way.   When he first got sick he was at home and really puffed up and coughing. Other than that he was in good spirits. After about 4-5 days he was admitted to a hospital where they don't have ventilation but oxygen tanks and he has been declining in health there.  His first xray indicated that 1/4 of his right lung was killed off or white and today (about 3 days after admission) we recieved news that he's at 30% lung capacity and requires oxygen at all times.   Can someone please just be straight up with me here and give me some sort of ballpark on the chances to recovery? He's been taking dexamethasone since the admission to the hospital and been relatively strong throughout the battle.  At this point I would just like to be prepared for what is to come.  Thank you\n\nAssistant:": {

After the repair, then another repair after the previous tore down the lung wall and icu for 3 weeks, sent home, seemed slow but able to do stuff. Year later stage 4 contuous o2, 3 powder inhalers, recuse inhalers, nebulizer taking it easy, I feel better. My fve is <30%, it'll be narrowed down to 10/20 etc in sept. Lung age is that of 100 y\\o and I'm 59.  You can live this way for years, avoid sick people, get pneumonia shots, flu shors, stay away from ppl with colds. Live in a dry low humidity if possible. If overweight, helps to lose weight.  If u smoke, stop. If u live w someone who smokes inside, get an air purifier for your room.   I don't think the damage can be undone, but adherence to med Dr's tell you is a great help. Make it much cooler at night as o2 levels tend to lower at night in my case.   Wear your mask 365 days a year. Grandkids tend to bring every home from school. (Helps with allergies too)",

There are plenty of unibody vehicles out there that make plenty of power but their towing capacity is usually rated at less than the weight of the vehicle, for example the Ridgeline, Tesla Model X, Ford Explorer. To prevent warping the frame.  Assuming the cyber truck weighs about 6,000-7,000 pounds, it\u2019s stated towing capacity would be 14,000lbs for the high end package. I have no doubts the engines can produce enough power to do that but how can it have a towing capacity of over twice it\u2019s weight without damaging the frame?

You need 4 things to tow:   1) torque   2) suitable brakes to stop the additional weight (unless the thing you're towing has its own)   3) a frame reinforced so pulling on the hitch won't cause it to buckle   4) suitable suspension/axles/wheels/hubs and appropriate weight distribution so the tongue weight of the trailer doesn't ruin your handling.  More power is a selling feature to a lay consumer, so that's rarely the issue. The other three are only selling features to the small segment who know they're buying a vehicle to tow with.

I think the problem you are having is that the opposite is actually true. The heavier it is, the less spare towing capacity it has.

What do you want to do, not big picture, just tasks.  What do you want to be doing this minute, this task.  An hour from now, what task do you want to be doing?  Our engineering is the sum of the small activities we do.  Working for an employer will provide a certain scope of work, scope of ownership and duty.  The position and type of work will create the tasks that are of that position and type of work, what you will be doing on a daily basic, what opportunities you will get to work on.  A different employer will have the opportunity to allow an entirely different set of tasks and opportunities.  I'll give an example.  I work for a turn-key manufacturer, aka raw materials in, finished goods out with internal fabrication and assembly.  I work for a pretty small company with a small number of engineers.  But we have a broad product base and have our our products and are an oem to most the major companies in the market.  We have standard products but also do custom work.  I'm a manufacturing engineer by degree, but frankly I've hardly done that.  Much of what I do is design enigneering, product development, continuous improvement, manufacturing support, tech support for customer companies and end customers.  The scope of my work is pretty literally everything from A to Z, from vendor sourcing to end customer support and everything in between.  I handle product development, life cycle support, manufacturing support, training, documentation, ERP and database management, work cell optimization, agency control and testing (UL, CSA), programming, maintenance of equipment, quality control, RMAs, continuous improvement (ECO/ECN/ECR, whatever your company calls it), project management, budgeting, hiring, training/mentoring, technical support for internal staff, and...I'm probably missing 50 other things.  Last summer I re-laid out our entirely factory floor, did the statistical analysis on production, inventory, and laid out all the work cells, all the inventory, all the equipment, electrical, air, etc.  The last several months have been work on a new product for a customer, a from scratch build of a new product for them to replace an old product they're phasing out.  A to Z again from vendor sourcing, full design from initial specifications, working with the customer on the design and development, prototype builds, R&D, revisions, and transition to full scale production.  Eventually that'll be $60m in revenue in the next few years.  Next year is going to focus on work cell optimization, process and material flow optimization, waste reduction, process control, tooling and ergonomics, etc.  Then it's back to some big product development stuff, next gen products, and we'll finally start phasing out some decades old products and readjust our position in the market space.  There's a bunch of other stuff too, but you get the idea.    Most of my work is macro and abstract.  I'm seldom stuck at a desk number crunching.  It's highly creative, open-ended, and hands-on.  It's huge in scope and ownership, highly varied, and intimately involved.  These are things I want in my work experience.  I dislike narrow scope.  I dislike being at a desk all the time.  I dislike just crunching numbers or doing just busy work.  I also seek growth and want the opportunity to have access to new materials, new tools, and new skills.  In many cases this is product driven, so if the product or future products/services require it, that drives your growth to develop and support that.  I know what I like, so I seek out this kind of work experience, this day in the life stuff, the what of what I actually do.  I work for an employer that offers a certain opportunity of work, a position, scope, type of work, etc.  If I work for a different employer, all that would be different.  I work where I do because I specifically want this type and scope of work.  It's what I enjoy.  I haven't worked a day in the last decade.  I just go to work and play all day.  It's fun.  It's been fun for a decade.  I'm never bored.  It's exciting and hugely varied.  It fits what I'm looking for.  Also just for reference, my engineering department consists of an manufacturing engineer, a mechanical engineer, and a process engineer.  We've also interned an industrial engineer for a number of years.  Realistically, we all pretty much do the same stuff.  I've found that often degree matters less about what you do and employer matters more.  Who you work for drives most of what you do as an engineer.  A lot of your effort needs to be placed on figuring out what you really like to do and then finding the type or types of companies that actually have that kind of work."

            " I have taken several courses on the history of the ME, but this topic in particular is highly politicized; original documents are highly biased depending on whether they are written by those sympathetic to British or Iranian interests.  The most informative piece of work on this topic is probably Mohammad Gholi Majd's 2013 book.  Generally speaking, there was a famine in the area, exacerbated by British, Russian, and Ottoman forces fighting for control of the area.    In more detail:  Some documents show that the population of Iran was 12 million in 1900, 15 million in 1910, and projections put it at 18-20 million in 1920.  But, census records in 1920 put the population at 10 million, suggesting that \"8-10 million\" people died, per Mohammad Gholi Majd.  Edit: Another user has commented on the veracity of these numbers and, while s/he notes that they are inaccurate, I believe his/her net assessment of the casualties results in a similar conclusion to the one I reach in the following paragraph.    I have not verified whether the census methodologies were consistent, nor have I attempted to vet the records noted by Gholi Majd in his book for internal consistency.  The urban statistics suggest a somewhat more modest reduction in net population.  In wartime, and during famine, there is usually a disproportionate reduction in urban population density relative to rural areas (Bradley Thayer, 2009; Alex de Sherbinin, 1995), and Tehran's population fell from 500,000 to 200,000 in this period (again, per Gholi Majd).  This isn't conclusive, but I would estimate gross casualties at ~5-7 million based on this figure.  Also important to note: the famine occurred some years prior to 1920, so using a 1920 population estimate to back-calculate a death toll from 1917-1918 or 1919 is going to give an inflated number.  In short, the author's \"8-10 million\" figure is almost certainly too high.    Regardless, it looks as though we can be *certain* that somewhere between 3 and 10 million people died, and the figure is likely towards the middle to upper end of that spectrum.  As to why it happened: there would have been a famine in Iran due to poor harvests, without any wars.  But, fighting between the occupying British, Russian, and Ottoman forces significantly exacerbated the problem.  Per Gholi Majd, British military grain and rice purchases from within Iran for the period were in excess of 500,000 tons (Russian & Ottoman figures not noted). This was seen as a savvy move, as the grain would otherwise have required importation from ~India, and it saved British shipping capacity for the Atlantic theatre.  The British and Russian (and Ottoman?) armies destroyed grain reserves in towns that they thought might be occupied by the other side(s) in the future.  The author also notes that the acting Iranian government saw an extreme reduction in revenue as a result of the conflict, and was unable to alleviate the famine.  He blames this on Britain's manipulation of currency re. oil exports, but I can't comment on the accuracy of this claim without extensive additional research.  Gholi Majd goes into much greater detail re. a number of British military decisions and policies that exacerbated the famine locally.    Contemporary documents say that the famine ended in 1918, but Gholi Majd suggests that it continued into 1919.  This is politically relevant, because fighting between Britain and Russia had ended by early 1918.  I don't want to get into the details, but, if the famine continued into 1919, post-war British policy may have been responsible for some of the casualties.    Contemporary media commented on the fact that the Russian army looted and contributed to the shortage as well, but Gholi Majd downplays their influence by suggesting that \"famine already stalked the land.\"  It's odd, because the exact same could be said for Britain's responsibility for the situation.  As best I can tell, Gholi Majd has a particular bone to pick with Britain.  If you read between the lines, it sounds as though the author is angry that Britain *chose* to feed its armies with locally-sourced grain, as opposed to using additional resources to import it.  Russia (apparently?) lacked similar logistic capabilities, so he sees them as less culpable.  This gets kind of wishy-washy, because the author uses historical facts to try to explore how the situation *could have been avoided* and devotes an entire chapter to explicitly address who should be blamed.  He very clearly holds Britain accountable.    There is also ~no mention of the Ottoman army/actions beyond some sparse notes regarding the timeline of their fighting with Britain well into 1918.  As best I can tell, Gholi Majd ~ignores the actions of the Russians and Ottomans, in preference to those of the British.  But, again, I'm not sifting through other original sources.    I also don't know what proportion of the grain consumed by Britain or Russian (or Ottoman) forces would have made its way to the Iranian people, so it's hard for me to blame either party for a set proportion of the final death toll.  They are responsible for some number of the dead.  Possibly millions.  Probably not as many as 8-10 million.  TL;DR There was a famine and a war being fought by outside parties.  3-10 million people died, mostly of starvation.  The fighting between Britain and Russia is to blame for at least some of the deaths.    Edit: formatting, some details",
            " So, I was curious because this was high on my front page and there were no answers, so I did a quick search. I found a paper discussing the effects that the 1918 flu pandemic had on Iran, and it included some background about the effect of WWI on the Iranian populace as well. A lot of this post is taken directly from this article, either verbatim or slightly paraphrased. (The citation is : Amir Afkhami. \"Compromised Constitutions: The Iranian Experience with the 1918 Influenza Pandemic.\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 77, no. 2 (2003): 367-392. https://muse.jhu.edu/)  So Iran declared its neutrality during WWI, but despite this the great powers used Iran as a battlefield at times. Russia and Britain both had imperialist designs on Iran for various reasons, interfering with its internal politics to try and secure their own interests, and as a result it became a target during the war. Some of the incidents during the war include: the Ottomans chasing the Russians into northwestern Azerbaijan in 1914; In 1915 Wilhelm Wassmuss organized a revolt among the Qashghai tribesman in southern Iran against the British who controlled oilfields in the area; The Russians counterattacked the Ottomans allowing the British to recover control of Southern Iran by 1916; A revolutionary Iranian group called the Jangalis emerged to control the countryside of Gilan in 1917-1918; Britain also tried to use Iran as a springboard to attack Russia in an attempt to reverse the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the new Soviet Union responded by annexing parts of northern Iran.  As a result of the warfare occurring in Iran, there was damage to Iran's economic, industrial and agricultural power. The occupying armies forcefully requisitioned or looted supplies. This led to widespread famine and the spread of disease. Iran's government was also essentially a protectorate surviving at the whims of whichever power was present and winning at the time, leaving them with little ability to actually help their own people. In addition, Ahmad Shah Qajar, the ruler of Iran at the time, was a weak ruler with little influence in his own government. The populace resented his father for authoritarian policies, and in an attempt to address this, Ahmad Shah tried to appoint only the best ministers, but he was unable to control their actions. In the face of the great powers of WWI using their country as a battlefield, and the threat of the Soviet Invasion and their humiliating demands, the populace resented the government's weakness, contributing to the political instability.  While political instability and warfare can lead to famines, the biggest cause is often climatic. 1916 and 1917 were both years with very dry summers, leading to crop failures. This, coupled with the foreign armies seizing what food they could, resulted in widespread famine, which was worsened by hoarders and speculators. When the influenza pandemic broke out in the spring of 1918, grain supplies had hit a low point, prices had doubled from six months before, (which had reached a ten-year peak). In addition, there were outbreaks of bubonic plague, cholera, malaria and typhus. The British were also building up for their attack on the Soviet Union, and sponsoring a native military contingent known as the \"South Persia Rifles\", making long-term contracts with large landowners for grain to feed the troops, adding to the scarcity.  F.A.C. Forbes-Leith describes the situation in what I assume is a memoir, Checkmate: Fighting Tradition in Central Persia. (I haven't read the actual book and am using a citation from Afkhami's article).  >\"The country was in a terrible state and the peasantry was in the last stages of starvation. Every time I was forced to stop my car, I was surrounded by hundreds of near-skeletons who screamed and fought for such scraps as I was able to spare. In a single day's journey of fifty-six miles between the towns of Kirind and Kermanshah, I counted twenty-seven corpses by the roadside, most of them those of women and children, and the general condition of life amongst the peasants was so frightful that I was ashamed to eat my simple rations in their presence.\"  So the Iranian famine of 1917-1918 was primarily a man-made catastrophe exacerbated by climatic conditions in which there was also an influx of infectious diseases. The wikipedia listing states that Majd's initial population estimate of 19 million is called into question with other estimates only being 11 million. Afkhami's article says that Iran's projected population at the beginning of 1918 was 11 million, so it may be that the 19 million number comes from *before* WWI broke out, and after the famine it had hit 11 million, at which point the influenza pandemic hit, killing a further 8% to 21% of the population according to Afkhami. (0.8 to 2.3 million). Although Afkhami's footnotes say that the population in 1918 was not too different from the population in 1913, before the war, which I am not sure whether to believe or not, given the effects of famine prior to the flu's arrival."

        "sft_target": " So, I was curious because this was high on my front page and there were no answers, so I did a quick search.

        "rejected_target": " I have taken several courses on the history of the ME, but this topic in particular is highly politicized; original documents are highly biased depending on whether they are written by those sympathetic to British or Iranian interests.  The most informative piece of work on this topic is probably Mohammad Gholi Majd's 2013 book.  Generally speaking, there was a famine in the area, exacerbated by British, Russian, and Ottoman forces fighting for control of the area.    In more detail:  Some documents show that the population of Iran was 12 million in 1900, 15 million in 1910, and projections put it at 18-20 million in 1920.  But, census records in 1920 put the population at 10 million, suggesting that \"8-10 million\" people died, per Mohammad Gholi Majd.  Edit: Another user has commented on the veracity of these numbers and, while s/he notes that they are inaccurate, I believe his/her net assessment of the casualties results in a similar conclusion to the one I reach in the following paragraph.    I have not verified whether the census methodologies were consistent, nor have I attempted to vet the records noted by Gholi Majd in his book for internal consistency.  The urban statistics suggest a somewhat more modest reduction in net population.  In wartime, and during famine, there is usually a disproportionate reduction in urban population density relative to rural areas (Bradley Thayer, 2009; Alex de Sherbinin, 1995), and Tehran's population fell from 500,000 to 200,000 in this period (again, per Gholi Majd).  This isn't conclusive, but I would estimate gross casualties at ~5-7 million based on this figure.  Also important to note: the famine occurred some years prior to 1920, so using a 1920 population estimate to back-calculate a death toll from 1917-1918 or 1919 is going to give an inflated number.  In short, the author's \"8-10 million\" figure is almost certainly too high.    Regardless, it looks as though we can be *certain* that somewhere between 3 and 10 million people died, and the figure is likely towards the middle to upper end of that spectrum.  As to why it happened: there would have been a famine in Iran due to poor harvests, without any wars.  But, fighting between the occupying British, Russian, and Ottoman forces significantly exacerbated the problem.  Per Gholi Majd, British military grain and rice purchases from within Iran for the period were in excess of 500,000 tons (Russian & Ottoman figures not noted). This was seen as a savvy move, as the grain would otherwise have required importation from ~India, and it saved British shipping capacity for the Atlantic theatre.  The British and Russian (and Ottoman?) armies destroyed grain reserves in towns that they thought might be occupied by the other side(s) in the future.  The author also notes that the acting Iranian government saw an extreme reduction in revenue as a result of the conflict, and was unable to alleviate the famine.  He blames this on Britain's manipulation of currency re. oil exports, but I can't comment on the accuracy of this claim without extensive additional research.  Gholi Majd goes into much greater detail re. a number of British military decisions and policies that exacerbated the famine locally.    Contemporary documents say that the famine ended in 1918, but Gholi Majd suggests that it continued into 1919.  This is politically relevant, because fighting between Britain and Russia had ended by early 1918.  I don't want to get into the details, but, if the famine continued into 1919, post-war British policy may have been responsible for some of the casualties.    Contemporary media commented on the fact that the Russian army looted and contributed to the shortage as well, but Gholi Majd downplays their influence by suggesting that \"famine already stalked the land.\"  It's odd, because the exact same could be said for Britain's responsibility for the situation.  As best I can tell, Gholi Majd has a particular bone to pick with Britain.  If you read between the lines, it sounds as though the author is angry that Britain *chose* to feed its armies with locally-sourced grain, as opposed to using additional resources to import it.  Russia (apparently?) lacked similar logistic capabilities, so he sees them as less culpable.  This gets kind of wishy-washy, because the author uses historical facts to try to explore how the situation *could have been avoided* and devotes an entire chapter to explicitly address who should be blamed.  He very clearly holds Britain accountable.    There is also ~no mention of the Ottoman army/actions beyond some sparse notes regarding the timeline of their fighting with Britain well into 1918.  As best I can tell, Gholi Majd ~ignores the actions of the Russians and Ottomans, in preference to those of the British.  But, again, I'm not sifting through other original sources.    I also don't know what proportion of the grain consumed by Britain or Russian (or Ottoman) forces would have made its way to the Iranian people, so it's hard for me to blame either party for a set proportion of the final death toll.  They are responsible for some number of the dead.  Possibly millions.  Probably not as many as 8-10 million.  TL;DR There was a famine and a war being fought by outside parties.  3-10 million people died, mostly of starvation.  The fighting between Britain and Russia is to blame for at least some of the deaths.    Edit: formatting, some details"

    "\n\nHuman: Fun and Exciting Opportunities Await You! \u2022 The /r/AskHistorians Flair Application Thread XXIV Welcome flair applicants! This is the place to apply for a flair \u2013 the colored text you will have seen next to some user's names indicating their specialization. We are always looking for new flaired users, and if you think you have what it takes to join the panel of historians, you're in the right place!  For examples of previous applications, and our current panel of historians, you can find the previous application thread here, and there is a list of active flaired users](/r/AskHistorians/wiki/flairedusers) on our wiki.  **[Requirements for a flair**  A flair in /r/AskHistorians indicates extensive, in-depth knowledge about an area of history *and* a proven track record of providing great answers in the subreddit. In applying for a flair, you are claiming to have:  * **Expertise in an area of history**, typically from either degree-level academic experience or an equivalent amount of self-study. For more exploration of this, check out this thread.  * The ability to **cite sources** from specialist literature for any claims you make within your area.  * The ability to provide **high quality answers** in the subreddit in accordance with our rules.    For a more in-depth look at how applications are analyzed, consult this helpful guide on our wiki explaining what an answer that demonstrates the above looks like.  **How to apply**  To apply for a flair, simply post in this thread. Your post needs to include:  * Links to **3 to 5 answers** which show a sustained involvement in the community, including at least one within the past month.    * These answers should **all relate to the topic area in which you are seeking flair**. They should demonstrate your claim to **knowledge and expertise** on that topic, as well as your ability to write about that topic **comprehensively and in-depth**. Outside credentials or works can provide secondary support, *but cannot replace these requirements*.  * The **text of your flair** and which category it belongs in (see the sidebar). Be as specific as possible as we prefer flair to reflect the exact area of your expertise as near as possible, but be aware there is a limit of 64 characters.  * If you are a former, now inactive flair, an application with **one** recent flair-quality answer, plus additional evidence of renewed community involvement, is required.  One of the moderators will then either confirm your flair or, if the application doesn't adequately show you meet the requirements, explain what's missing. If you get rejected, don't despair! We're happy to give you advice and pointers on how to improve your portfolio for a future application. Plenty of panelists weren't approved the first time.  If there's a backlog this may take a few days but we will try to get around to everyone as quickly as possible.  **Updated Procedures**  Note that we have made some slight changes to the requirements of the past. Previous applications required all answers to be within the past six months. But we realize that this can sometimes be tough if you write about uncommon topics. We have changed the temporal requirement to be *one* answer that was written in the past month. The answers as a whole will be evaluated holistically with an eye towards a regular pace of contributions. i.e. 3 answers each spaced 3 months apart would be accepted now, but we would likely ask for more recent contributions if an application was one recent answer and the rest over a year old. Flair reflects not only expertise, but involvement in the AskHistorians community.  **\"I'm an Expert About Something But Never Have a Chance to Write About It!\"**  Some topics only come up once in a blue moon, but that doesn't mean you can't still get flair in it! There are a number of avenues to follow, many of which are dealt with in greater detail at the last section of this thread.  **Expected Behavior**  We invest a large amount of trust in the flaired members of /r/askhistorians, as they represent the subreddit when answering questions, participating in AMAs, and even in their participation across reddit as a whole. As such, we do take into account an applicant's user history reddit-wide when reviewing an application, and will reject applicants whose post history demonstrate bigotry, racism, or sexism. Such behavior is not tolerated in /r/askhistorians, and we do not tolerate it from our panelists in any capacity. We additionally reserve the right to revoke flair based on evidence of such behavior after the application process has been completed. /r/AskHistorians is a safe space for everyone, and those attitudes have no place here.  **Quality Contributors**  If you see an unflaired user consistently giving excellent answers, they can be nominated for a \"Quality Contributor\" flair. Just message the mods their username and some example comments which you believe meet the above criteria.  **FAQ Finder**   To apply for FAQ finder, we require demonstration of a consistent history of community involvement and linking to previous responses and the FAQ. We expect to see potential FAQ Finders be discerning in what they link to, ensuring that it is to threads which represent the current standards of the subreddit, and they do so in a polite and courteous manner, both to the 'Asker', and also by including a username ping of the original 'Answerer'.  **Revoking Flair**  Having a flair brings with it a greater expectation to abide by the subreddit's rules and maintain the high standard of discussion we all like to see here. The mods will revoke the flair of anybody who continually breaks the rules, fails to meet the standard for answers in their area of expertise, or violates the above mentioned expectations. Happily, we almost never have to do this.  **Additional Resources**  Before applying for flair, we encourage you to check out these resources to help you with the application process:  * Our Rules Roundtable on what a 'Good Answer' looks like * Our Wiki Guide on what makes a good application * The Previous Application Threads, to see what makes for successful - and not successful - applications.  * The Sunday Digest, and Monthly Awards which can provide many examples of we are looking for regarding the caliber of flaired users.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: What is the psychology behind the Holocaust Denial? What are the factors that explain the resilience against any historical and archeological evidence that explain the existence of the Holocaust? Why is there such resilience against this infamous genocide versus other controversies that occurred? Please, I want to highlight that I am not a denier here.  I like to look into different sides of the argument as people and I learned that how history is taught is also what it is written and interpreted.  Now the evidence that we have (from what I have gathered) of the existence of the Holocaust are plenty.  Firstly, Hitler's speeches and his Mein Kampf book show many hints of the hatred and scapegoating of Jews.  Next are the anti-Jewish acts that occurred in Germany before they are hunted and killed such as businesses that were owned by Jews were closed and declared illegal, homes and shops of Jewish people were vandalised, synapogues were closed, and Jewish people had to wear tags or labels or the Star of David as a clear indicator.  Then, there are the documents and the places that show the existence of the Holocaust. Auschwitz is the most obvious example and a powerful one. The conditions of the place show how the Jews were treated and the uniform that they wore, and the amount of shoes collected of the ones that were killed and gassed, numbers and tattoes in every one and so on.  The Nuremberg trials are also evidence of the existence of war criminals who used the war effort or had some influence in the Nazi party on the acts that were conducted against Jews and other people that were deemed inferior or the enemy of the Germans.  The sheer number, scale and intensity of it feels unbelievably unreal (I must admit, even I find it hard to swallow that people were and are go to such extreme lengths) but many evidence show that this genocide existed.  Now, I want to show a different side here.  When I hear a revisionists' argument or an argument of an Denialist who wants to question the evidence that was gathered, I also want to look into that argument as well.  Is the evidence actually valid and real? Do the Denialists' evidence and arguments also hold as much validity and merit? Can the science of psychology show that the human species is indeed capable of such extreme acts?  At the same time, I am also puzzled and curious as to why there is this level of confirmation bias about this topic, particularly towards the Holocaust.  What are the factors or the reasonings that explain why some people are inclined to deny the collected evidence or question the actuality of this era?  As there a common theme involved such as paranoia or a certain upbringing or anti-governmental attitudes or imperialistic values?  Why is there such focus on wanting to deny the actions that occurred that were made by those who took part of the Holocaust than for example in other genocides or controversial topics that existed, especially in recent memory such as the Armenian genocide or when Japanese-American citizens were put into concentration camps of their own by America when the latter entered the war?  (please correct me if I am wrong whether the concentration camps of the Japanese-Americans were of the same level of poor quality and poor conditions as those of Nazi Germany)\n\nAssistant:": {

            " My Monday methods on Holocaust denial has already been posted but I also want to repost something I have written some time ag about holocaust denial, its history, prevalence and motive.  **Part 1**  The short version is that people adjust what they choos to believe in accordance with their political prejudices and opinions most of the time and people who advocate Holocaust denial are, in large parts, anti-Semites of some flavor or another.  ## What is the Holocaust? What is Holocaust Denial?  As a starting point, I'm going to define what is the Holocaust and subsequently, what is Holocaust Denial.  Within the relevant scholarly literature, the term Holocaust is defined as the systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of approximately six million Jews and up to half a million Roma, Sinti, and other groups persecuted as \"gypsies\" by the Nazi regime and its collaborators. It took place at the same time as other atrocities and crimes such as the Nazis targeting other groups on grounds of their perceived \"inferiority\", like the disabled and Slavs, and on grounds of their religion, ideology or behavior among them Communists, Socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses and homosexuals. During their 12-year reign, the conservative estimate of victims of Nazi oppression and murder numbers 11 million people, though newer studies put that number at somewhere between 15 and 20 million people.  Holocaust Denial is the attempt and effort to negate, distort, and/or minimize and trivialize the established facts about the Nazi genocides against Jews, Roma, and others most often with the goal to rehabilitate Nazism as an ideology.  Because of the staggering numbers given above, the fact that the Nazi regime applied the tools at the disposal of the modern state to genocidal ends, their sheer brutality, and a variety of other factors, the ideology of Nazism and the broader historical phenomenon of Fascism in which Nazism is often placed, have become \u2013 rightfully so \u2013 politically tainted. As and ideology that is at its core racist, anti-Semitic, and genocidal, Nazism and Fascism have become politically discredited throughout most of the world.  Holocaust Deniers primarily seek to remove this taint from the ideology of Nazism by distorting, ignoring, and misrepresenting historical fact and thereby make Nazism and Fascism socially acceptable again. In other words, Holocaust Denial is a form of political agitation in the service of bigotry, racism, and anti-Semitism.  In his book *Lying about Hitler* Richard Evans summarizes the following points as the most frequently held beliefs of Holocaust Deniers:  > (a) The number of Jews killed by the Nazis was far less than 6 million; it amounted to only a few hundred thousand, and was thus similar to, or less than, the number of German civilians killed in Allied bombing raids. > > (b) Gas chambers were not used to kill large numbers of Jews at any time. > > (c) Neither Hitler nor the Nazi leaderhsip in general had a program of exterminating Europe's Jews; all they wished to do was to deport them to Eastern Europe. > > (d) \"The Holocaust\" was a myth invented by Allied propaganda during the war and sustained since then by Jews who wished to use it for political and financial support for the state of Israel or for themselves. The supposed evidence for the Nazis' wartime mass murder of millions of Jews by gassing and other means was fabricated after the war.  Richard Evans: *Lying about Hitler. History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial*, New York 2001, p. 110]  ## A short history of Holocaust Denial and its methods in the West  Holocaust denialism has its roots in the Nazis' own efforts to hide their crimes from the world. I have gone into this before [here. Especially the efforts of Sonderkommando 1005 and the destruction of records at the end of the war was intended to hide and deny these crimes and thus portray the regime in a more positive light.  This was , of course, used in Nuremberg and other various post war trials by the defendants, who either pushed a narrative of not having known, not having been involved, or all going back to Hitler, Himmler, Heydrich and others who were dead or otherwise not present at Nuremberg (Eichmann e.g., who was made out by Dieter Wisliceny to be sort of a master mind of the Holocaust). Similarly, several defendants at Nuremberg engage in what has developed to become a classical tactics of deniers, e.g. minimizing the numbers, taking code language out of context with phrases such as resettlement, chalking up deaths to disease etc.  Also, surrounding Nuremberg and the revelations of the Nazi crimes, several different strands of fascist, right-wing extremist, and Nazi political agendas started to deny the Holocaust for a variety for reasons. In Germany, you -- of course -- have all the former Nazis who in order present a clean image of the regime and to rehabilitate themselves and the Nazi regime started to write books where they claimed the Holocaust to have either not happened or be the result of a Jewish conspiracy. For example, Otto von dem Bach-Zelewski, former head of an Einsatzgruppe, who had freely given information at the Nuremberg trials and thus saved his skin started in the 1950s to once again reverse his stand and put out a wealth of denialist literature. Similarly, a plethora of former Wehrmacht generals and officers engaged in their own form of denial by either denying the crimes of the regime outright or by presenting the Wehrmacht as not involved in such crimes. Especially the latter, the myth of the clean Wehrmacht, was one of the most successful forms of Holocaust denial and was very popular in Germany until the 80s and can still be observed today.  Another political agenda that used Holocaust denialism as its tool right after the war, was a certain strand of proto-fascist and right-wing extremist thinkers who wanted to clean fascism and their ideology from the strain of being associated with Hitler and the Holocaust. Douglas Reed is such an example. Reed, who was a prominent journalist in Great Britain, was against Hitler but not against Nationalsocialism (he favored the Otto Strasser position). In the late 40s, early 50s he started publishing books which claimed Hitler had been a Zionist agent and his policy of killing the Jews was a Jewish plot to justify the creation of Israel and which was done against the wishes of many Nazis. At some point it became increasingly hard for him to find publishers, so he moved to South Africa and became involved in supporting apartheid politics in SA and Rhodesia.  Another -- and rather odd -- strand of denialism comes from a pacifists. Pacifism had been very popular during the time between the World Wars because of the effects of WWI and after World War Two, a couple of people of the radical pacifist movement saw their positions threatened because the crimes of the Nazis were a major reason why the war against Nazi Germany was portrayed as a moral and necessary war. In the United States, a former mainstream historian and pacifist activist, Harry Elmer Barnes, started publishing literature that claimed the Holocaust was an Allied invention to justify their war against German, which they had started in 1939.  Another example of this is the -- still cited by Holocaust deniers to this day -- work of Paul Rassinier, who in many a ways is the father of modern Holocaust denial. Rassinier, also a staunch pacifist, was a member of the French resistance, where he -- unsuccessfully -- tried to get the Resistance to engage the Nazi occupation peacefully rather than with violence. Arrested by the Nazis in 1943 and deported to the Buchenwald and later Dora-Mittelbau Concentration Camps, Rassinier did write several books and pamphlets after the war in which he denied the existence of gas chambers and of mass extermination - ostensibly because he had never experienced it.  Rassinier was an odd fellow, whose work could be engaged in its own journal article. He, for example, did not deny the brutality of the camps but instead of holding the SS responsible, he blamed his fellow prisoners. Something, which could and has been engaged in modern scholarship as the result of the perfidious Nazi camp system.  But aside from the reason of Rassinier denying the Holocaust because he never experienced it, he also started to engage in Holocaust denial because he was an anti-Semite and a lot of his writing is informed by his hatred for Jews and the state of Israel, which he saw as based on a Jewish lie and as a threat to peace. The fact that Rassinier was a survivor, an academically trained historian, and a Holocaust denying anti-Semite makes his works favorites in denialist circles to this day.  Holocaust denialism the way we know it today started in the 1960s/70s with the rise of neo-fascist and neo-extreme rightits political movements and causes. Not directly referencing Nazism and old-school fascism as their sources of inspiration but still viewing themselves in the same historical lineage, a lot of these people saw themselves as the right counter-movement to the New Left of 1968 and so on. From Arthur Butz to David Irving, it was this generation who had not themselves taken part in the war and in the Anglosphere rejected the narratives of their elders as the Second World War being just, which formed the most tropes, arguments and methods used by Holocaust deniers to this day. This ranges from the supposedly \"scientific\" denialism of Leuchter and Z\u00fcndel to the more subtle relativism of Irving and Nolte to the outright denial of everything like Faurisson's.",

        "sft_target": " My Monday methods on Holocaust denial has already been posted but I also want to repost something I have written some time ag about holocaust denial, its history, prevalence and motive.  **Part 1**  The short version is that people adjust what they choos to believe in accordance with their political prejudices and opinions most of the time and people who advocate Holocaust denial are, in large parts, anti-Semites of some flavor or another.  ## What is the Holocaust? What is Holocaust Denial?  As a starting point, I'm going to define what is the Holocaust and subsequently, what is Holocaust Denial.  Within the relevant scholarly literature, the term Holocaust is defined as the systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of approximately six million Jews and up to half a million Roma, Sinti, and other groups persecuted as \"gypsies\" by the Nazi regime and its collaborators. It took place at the same time as other atrocities and crimes such as the Nazis targeting other groups on grounds of their perceived \"inferiority\", like the disabled and Slavs, and on grounds of their religion, ideology or behavior among them Communists, Socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses and homosexuals. During their 12-year reign, the conservative estimate of victims of Nazi oppression and murder numbers 11 million people, though newer studies put that number at somewhere between 15 and 20 million people.  Holocaust Denial is the attempt and effort to negate, distort, and/or minimize and trivialize the established facts about the Nazi genocides against Jews, Roma, and others most often with the goal to rehabilitate Nazism as an ideology.

As you may know, pre-war Poland had a Jewish population around three and a half million.  During the Holocaust around 98% of them were killed.  Several thousand made it back to Poland afterwards, joining those few who had survived in place and those who had fled to Poland from genocide in other countries.  In July of 1946, just over a year since the end of the war, there were about 200 Jews who had returned home to the town of Kielce, Poland.  Their former homes were no longer available -- a phrase that glosses over another injustice against them -- so most of them were staying in a building they had purchased for temporary housing.

            " There was a significant timegap between the 'last helicopter out of Saigon' and the final PAVN push to capture the city.

It was just a matter of waiting your turn for a helicopter to take you to one of the ships on station off the Vietnamese coast.\"  With Martins having ordered that only Americans be evacuated earlier that dawn, we can deduce that likely no Vietnamese were granted access to the last round of helicopter flights out to sea.  As PAVN troops were assaulting downtown Saigon at the same time, and with South Vietnam unconditionally surrendering at 10:24, we can deduce that few South Vietnamese decided to stick around at the embassy for the three hours after the last helicopter left.  The following days, PAVN forces consolidated their control in Ho Chi Minh City, with the Embassy and other government buildings being raided.

            " The charge that Islam was an import to Africa did show up among Nation of Islam\u2019s (NOI) critics. Kwame Ture (at the time known as Stokely Carmichael) of the Black Panthers charged that \u201cIslam is not an African religion,\u201d and argued Islamic expansion was linked to the slave trade. NOI members rebutted this in different ways. The most common way was to argue on the basis of NOI\u2019s cosmology that Islam actually predated Muhammad and was connected with the creation of the Black people.  **Nation of Islam\u2019s Creation Story**  The Nation of Islam\u2019s (NOI) version of Islamic history differs quite dramatically from most historians' or popular understandings of Islamic history. NOI understood Islam to be the original religion of humanity from the beginning of time 66 trillion years ago and original humans to be Black. According to NOI\u2019s understanding, Black people had brought Islam to the Middle East, not the other way around.  According to the teachings of Elijah Mohammad, the founder of NOI, the first people were Arabic speaking Black Muslims of the Tribe of Shabazz. Earth was originally a utopia governed by a council of 24 Black Muslim scientists. This paradise was lost when an evil scientist named Yacub created white people out of experiments on the Black race. White people were understood to be devils. Islam\u2019s origins according to NOI were not actually in the Middle East or connected with Muhammad.  **Defending Islam as a Black religion**  In 1971 Edward L.X. Truitt spoke out against Carmichael\u2019s claim that Islam was not an African religion by contending that \u201cIslam is the religion of the Original people, who are Black, brown, red, and yellow descendants of the original Black Man, the maker and owner of planet earth.\u201d Thus, Islam was actually the creation of Black people. Embracing Islam for Black people was seen as a restoration of a lost heritage.  Other NOI members argued that the any effort to portray Islam as foreign to Africa was a plot to undermine NOI and Elijah Muhammad. Diogenes X. Grassal, for example, denounced any contemporary focus on African culture as a plan by white people to undermine Black men. According to Grassal, Yoruba and Swahili were inferior languages to Arabic, and Islam was the source of all Black achievement in Egypt, Arabia, Asia, and West Africa. Charles 67X denounced Black nationalists like Amiri Baraka for contending Arab Muslims had harmed Africa. 67X maintained that Islam had brought advanced civilization to Africa. NOI members often took harshly critical views towards Africa, which they believed to be primitive without the teachings of Islam.  **NOI and Moorish Science**  I have previously written on AskHistorians about the NOI\u2019s roots in the earlier Moorish Science Temple, an Islamic movement which appeared in Chicago after World War I. Like the later NOI movement, Moorish Science, was not grounded in traditional Sunni or Shia understandings of Islam or deeply concerned with the historical particulars of Islam, Muhammad, or early Islamic history in the Middle East. Both movements instead claimed that Islam was racially connected with Black Americans.  **Summary**  NOI\u2019s understanding of Islam\u2019s origins, teachings, and spread, had little to do with secular or mainstream Islamic understandings of history. For NOI, Islam was not a Middle Eastern religion, it was a Black religion, which had been associated with Black people since human beings had existed. Debates about Islamic expansion and involvement in the slave trade did not matter to NOI\u2019s sense of sacred history.

    "\n\nHuman: Why do English speakers refer to U-boats as such and not just \u201csubmarines?\u201d Is there any reason that English speakers refer  to u-boats and submarines as two separate things? The term is totally ubiquitous when I read about the wars, but I can\u2019t think of many other scenarios where we use native terms to describe something. I never hear German flamethrowers called flammenwerfers in English books, so how did German submarines get described as undersea bootens in English books?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " The term \"U-Boat\" has an interested and complicated history. It has been ingrained in popular consciousness through decades of books, movies, TV shows, and video games. There are a never ending parade of new books come out that have U-Boat in the title. Some include:  * *Hitler\u2019s U-Boat War: The Hunters, 1939-1942*, * *America\u2019s U-Boats: Terror Trophies of World War I*,  * *The Merchant U-Boat: Adventures of the Deutschland, 1916-1918*, * *Hitler\u2019s \u201cWonder\u201d U-Boats: The Birth of the Cold War\u2019s Hunter Killer Submarines*  It is safe to say this is a very truncated list of \"U-Boat\" books but are some examples of the way that it gets used today: to refer exclusively to German submarines. Now, it is a term I try to avoid in my writing - even when discussing German submarines. The first reason for this is that there exists a direct English translation for *unterseeboot*: submarine. It is a word whose meaning is fully captured by a direct translation. Secondly, it is a *half translation* of the German. The short german version of *Unterseeboot* is *U-Boot*, not \"U-Boat\".   I also wish to avoid the romanticization and mystification that comes from utilizing German terminology. The term \u201cu-boat\u201d adds a layer of mystery to German submarines that did not exist during the First World War and through using the term, usage of the submarine gets tied almost entirely to Germany. In equating submarines with Germany, authors can give a false impression about the scope of submarine operations to the war, while also giving a romantic edge to a policy which resulted in the deliberate deaths of civilians. It gets used as a term of romanticization, that makes German submarines into an \"other\", even though many other countries were using their submarines in the same or similar ways during both World Wars. The Germans **DID NOT** have a monopoly on submarines or submarine operations. Why use a term which invites a romantizied and simple interpretation?  The term additionally invokes images of Nazi Germany and its submarine campaigns during the Second World War. There was nothing particularly special about German submarines during the First World War that necessitates identifying them by a German word. Authors do not refer to French submarines as \u201csous-marins\u201d in their writing, thus the same standard should be applied to the Germans. What set German submarines apart was how they were utilized, but this was not inherent to the submarine itself and that can be appropriately expressed without utilizing the term \u201cU-Boat.\u201d  I would go as far to say that the same applies to German submarines of the Second World War. The linked answer from u/Georgy_K_Zhukov best frames these sorts of reasons for avoiding the term.  OK so, with the reasons why *I* try to avoid \"U-Boat\" in my writing, lets dig into some of its history.  \"U-Boat\" starts to appear in English publications as shorthand for \"Submarine\" in late 1915. The beginning of the war saw positive comments in the American press about British, French, and German submarines - but these articles always used the word \"sub\" or \"submarine\" with the nation acting as an adjective. It's not until months after the *Lusitania* was sunk on May 7th, 1915 that \"U-Boat\" starts to appear.  This may seem like a logical point for the \"otherizing\" nature of \"U-Boat\" to have begun - but it's actually not! At this point, the phrase was being used in lieu of \"Sub\" or \"Submarine\" in headlines and photo captions. \"U-Boat\" was being used as a direct substitute for those words in newspapers to *save space* in areas where that was a key concern. This interpretation is borne out by the fact that the phrase \"U-Boat\" was utilized in headlines and captions to describe **ANY** submarine, not just German ones. There were articles about American submarines called \"Uncle Sam's U-Boats\" (referring to submarines built and operated by the US, not the captured ones discussed in that book I mentioned above) and \"British U-Boats\" and \"French U-Boats\". In the text of these articles, the term \"U-Boat\" wasn't used instead they said \"German subs\" or \"American submarines\". So in essence the phrase first took hold as a way of saving space in headlines and captions in newspapers during the First World War, and it's clear that there was at least some understanding that the Allies *also* were using Submarines in various ways.  Even the American war history for Submarine Division 5, whose sole purpose in Ireland was to hunt for German submarines, does not use the term. They use \"the enemy\", \"hun\", \"Germans\", \"submarine\" - but not \"U-Boat\". And they were fighting them!  What set the Germans apart in the First World War was mostly their usage. Not in specifically waging an anti-shipping campaign (as the British and Russians conducted one in the Baltic Sea, and the British and French in the Sea of Marmara) but in an \"unrestricted\" campaign where merchant vessels (initially belligerent in 1915, but eventually also neutral in 1917) were liable to be sunk without warning - their crew and passengers not allowed to get to safety. The *overall* usage of German submarines was often similar to the Allies, and their boats were roughly the same. Yes, there were some differences in endurance, class types, and specific pieces of technology (the Allies usually bemoaned their periscopes compared to the German ones, for example)  - but these were not huge gulfs in submarine technology (especially since the British developed and deployed some of the most sophisicated submarines of the war). German submarines were pretty similar to their Allied counterparts, and this is reflected in the phrase \"U-Boat\" being applied to all nations.  This practice did not end with the start of the Second World War in Europe. There were newspapers applying \"U-Boat\" to British and French submarines up through 1941. So not even the unrestricted campaign up to that point of the Second World War was enough to entirely associate \"U-Boat\" with Germany. It's not seen after 1942, leading me to suspect that US entry into the Second World War was a decisive factor in needing to \"otherize\" German submarines.  That is in more popular parlance. The term may have gained hold among those in the Naval service when talking about a specific **class** of German submarines. A piece of evidence for this is a lecture given Captain T.C. Hart in 1920. He had been an officer in the US Submarine force during the First World War. In his lecture, he does refer to \"U-Boats\", but when he does he is referring specifically to the \"*U*\" Class. He differentiates them from the \"*UB*\" and \"*UC*\" classes. This is an area which requires a bit more investigation.  So in essence, no it's my opinion that we should not be using the term \"u-boat\". They're just submarines, and we're doing readers a historical disservice to treat German submarines as a mysterious \"other\", when they were so very similar to their Allied counterparts and to how the term was historically used.  Also tagging /u/tough_guys_wear_pink as you might find this interesting.",
            " Not to discourage further answers, but this one by u/Georgy_K_Zhukov may be of interest though it does not specifically refer to U-Boats, rather to the Luftwaffe, Kriegsmarine, and Wermacht.",
            " It\u2019s just a semantic convention to specifically indicate that German submarines are being referred to. (Although this convention also applies to Austro-Hungarian submarines.) An analogue would be the use of the term *panzer* when referring specifically to German tanks, or using the Japanese word *kamikaze* rather than saying \u201cJapanese suicide pilot.\u201d   This convention is partly borne from the reputation of German submarines in both World Wars. Germany lacked a surface fleet capable of directly challenging the Royal Navy, so it instead relied on U-boats as a more cost-effective means of targeting Allied seagoing trade and, to a lesser extent, naval ships. The U-boats sank thousands of ships in both wars, earning a sinister reputation and an indelible place in the minds of civilian and naval sailors alike. Churchill himself famously said of WW2 that \u201cthe only thing that ever really frightened me during the war was the U-boat peril.\u201d Thus, use of \u201cU-boat\u201d instead of \u201cGerman submarine\u201d more aptly reflects the German submarine\u2019s place in the English-speaking imagination.   I am in the process of publishing a non-fiction book about the U-boat offensive against the US East Coast in WW2 if you have any other U-boat related questions.",

It's not seen after 1942, leading me to suspect that US entry into the Second World War was a decisive factor in needing to \"otherize\" German submarines.  That is in more popular parlance. The term may have gained hold among those in the Naval service when talking about a specific **class** of German submarines. A piece of evidence for this is a lecture given Captain T.C. Hart in 1920. He had been an officer in the US Submarine force during the First World War. In his lecture, he does refer to \"U-Boats\", but when he does he is referring specifically to the \"*U*\" Class. He differentiates them from the \"*UB*\" and \"*UC*\" classes. This is an area which requires a bit more investigation.  So in essence, no it's my opinion that we should not be using the term \"u-boat\". They're just submarines, and we're doing readers a historical disservice to treat German submarines as a mysterious \"other\", when they were so very similar to their Allied counterparts and to how the term was historically used.  Also tagging /u/tough_guys_wear_pink as you might find this interesting.",
        "rejected_target": " It\u2019s just a semantic convention to specifically indicate that German submarines are being referred to. (Although this convention also applies to Austro-Hungarian submarines.) An analogue would be the use of the term *panzer* when referring specifically to German tanks, or using the Japanese word *kamikaze* rather than saying \u201cJapanese suicide pilot.\u201d   This convention is partly borne from the reputation of German submarines in both World Wars. Germany lacked a surface fleet capable of directly challenging the Royal Navy, so it instead relied on U-boats as a more cost-effective means of targeting Allied seagoing trade and, to a lesser extent, naval ships. The U-boats sank thousands of ships in both wars, earning a sinister reputation and an indelible place in the minds of civilian and naval sailors alike. Churchill himself famously said of WW2 that \u201cthe only thing that ever really frightened me during the war was the U-boat peril.\u201d Thus, use of \u201cU-boat\u201d instead of \u201cGerman submarine\u201d more aptly reflects the German submarine\u2019s place in the English-speaking imagination.   I am in the process of publishing a non-fiction book about the U-boat offensive against the US East Coast in WW2 if you have any other U-boat related questions."

    "\n\nHuman: What is fascism? I hear people describe things they don't like as \"fascist\" a lot. But I feel like it's often used as a general insult against people, ideas, or organizations the user dislikes, rather than actually making an informed comparison to historical governments.   I know that, historically, Mussolini's Italy, Nazi Germany, and Franco's Spain were all described as fascist. But I don't really know what that means.   What separates fascism from other types of dictatorships? What makes it fascist? What qualities define a fascist government or fascist outlook? Can people or ideas be fascist? Is fascism nessecarily racist? Is there anything often compared to fascism that is objectively not fascist?  I hope this question isn't too polarizing. I look forward to any guidance! Thank you.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " There is a plethora of definitions for Fascism, from defining it as a very narrowly by limiting it to the historical phenomenon of Mussolini's rule in Italy to a very broad definition like the one used historically by Marxists, which I have described in-depth in this thread.  The one I found most useful and sensible within the context of my own historical work  is the approach used by Robert Paxton in his book *The Anatomy of Fascism*, which defines Fascism from a praxeological standpoint.  Paxton points out in his introduction that despite Fascism being a major phenomenon of the 20th century, even now no definition of Fascism has obtained universal assent as a complete satisfactory account of the phenomenon. Fascist movements varied so strongly from one national setting to another that some scholars even cast doubt that the term is more than a political smear word.  However, it is also impossible to ignore how many movements in inter-war Europe and even beyond chose the descriptor of Fascism for themselves as well as what kind of structural and practical similarities existed between many of these movements.  One of the major factors, Paxton points to when examining Fascist movements its view on what drives history: Unlike the advocators of liberal democracy, it is not reason or modernization, which drives forward and unlike communists, it is not material relationships. For the Fascist the engine of history is conflict, whether between nations, peoples or races. History is a constant struggle in which a community of mythical qualities needs to assert itself in order to gain dominance over others. Dominance is the core goal and must be asserted. And only if the right and rightful people dominate will a golden age begin.  The political utopia of the Fascist differs greatly from liberal or communist visions of utopia: Both of the latter are build on a vision of a utopian future that needs to be build and achieved. The Fascist on the other hand looks to the past for its utopia since most fantasies of dominance are historically justified. Whether it is the return to the Roman Empire or the mythical Lebensraum of German kings, all Fascist utopian visions are build upon a return to a hazy, mythological past in which the world was right.  This factory is depended on and at the same time leads to the strong inherently anti-modernist rhetoric of Fascist movements. From tropes such as the city corrupting the purity of rural live or the return to a blood-and-soil type romantic idyll or decrying the devaluation of the core family and the place of women in society as \"unnatural\" Fascism espouses a rhetoric that uses the past to justify a complete and total criticism of the present and advocates building an alternate modernity in the image of a supposedly \"pure\" past.  Consequently, Fascists see themselves as not merely espousing an ideology but rather, a creed or \u2013 as the Nazis called it \u2013 a Weltanschauung (roughly translated as \"world view\"). As Paxton writes:  > In a way unlike the classical \"isms\", the rightness of fascism does not depend on the truth of any proposition advanced in its name. Fascism is \"true\" insofar as it helps fulfill the destiny of a chosen race or people or blood, locked with other peoples in a Darwinian struggle, and not in the light of some abstract universal reason. (...) The truth was whatever permitted the new fascist man (and woman) to dominate others, and whatever made the chosen people triumph. > > Fascism rested not upon the truth of its doctrine but upon the leader's mystical union with historic destiny of his people. (...) The fascist leader wanted to bring his people into a higher realm of politics that they would experience sensually: the warmth of belonging to a race now fully aware of its identity, historic destiny, and power; the excitement of participating in a vast collective enterprise; the gratification of submerging oneself in a wave of shared feelings, and of sacrificing one's petty concerns for the group's good; and the thrill of domination. Fascism deliberate replacement of reasoned debate with immediate sensual experience transformed politics, as the exiled cultural critic Walter Benjamin was first to point, into aesthetics. And the ultimate fascist aesthetic experience, Benjamin warned in 1936, was war. >  > Fascist leaders made no secret of having no program. (...) Fascism radical instrumentalization of truth explains why fascists never bothered to write any casuistical literature when they changed their program as they did often and without compunction. Stalin was forever writing to prove that his policies accorded somehow with the principles of Marx and Lenin; Hitler and Mussolini never bothered with any such theoretical justification.  In the same vein, Paxton goes on to define Fascism as   > a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victim-hood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.  What is important here is not only that Fascism operates always under the assumption of threat resulting from the inherent view on the way history always functions as a conflict; it's also imperative that Paxton defines it as a form of political behavior rather than a stringent world-view.  In service of the core narrative of threat and conflict, an ill-defined and mythical past to which the goal is to return, and Fascisms use of authoritarian means to these ends, Fascism is the turning of politics into spectacle and an aesthetic experience. It doesn't matter in a sense what kind of program it is espousing at the moment but the imperative lies in an utopia with an open definition in whose service the experience of community against the forces that threaten the community, the way of life, the \"chosen race\" have rallied. Who these enemies are depend on historical and national context, it is the underlying practice that is so essential to the political behavior of Fascism.  Paxton's approach to the subject has been immensely useful in my own studies of Nazi Germany because rather than listicles providing definitions of fascism according to its content or trying to cut through the literature published by Nazis and Italian and other Fascists in order to analyze common threads and construct a Weberian \"ideal type\" of fascism, this approach is best able to serve as a framework when it comes to what is often perceived as the internal inconsistencies of Nazism, from revolutionary rhetoric in its early periods to alliances with traditional social elites to the eclectic mix of Roman, Germanian and other aesthetic to serve propagandist ends. Even the self-description of \"National Socialism\" can best understood as embracing a certain political methodology and practice rather than a profession for what we tend to understand as any form of actual socialism.  Fascism is therefore about function and form, not so much concrete content. Paxton goes on in his book to examine historically fascist movements throughout the various stages they moved through and while expanding upon them here would probably lead too far, I can not recommend his book highly enough. Towards the end of his book, he writes about Fascism outside of Europe and in light of recent renewed interest in the subject in the US, I think the following passage is especially pertinent:  > The United States itself has never been exempt from fascism. (...) Much more dangerous [than movements like the American Nazi Party, which utilize already established tenants and creeds from Europe] are movements that employ authentically American themes in ways that resemble fascism functionally. The Klan revived in the 1920s, took on virulent anti-Semitism, and spread to the cities of the Middle West. In the 1930s, Father Charles E. Coughlin gathered a radio audience estimated at forty million around anti-communist, anti-Wall Street, pro-soft money, and \u2013 after 1938 \u2013 anti-Semtic message broadcast from his church in the outskirts of Detroit.

    "\n\nHuman: \u2018Don\u2019t mention the war!\u201d, or, When did Germans become tourists again in post-WWII Europe and how were they received? I have recently been traveling extensively through the mountain villages of Crete, and so many have memorials to the deaths of local residents during WWII. In some villages all the men and boys were rounded up and killed. Even the food culture here records stories of foods that are bittersweet now because they were foods of survival during the war. This is not to mention the absolute holocaust of Greek Jews. At the same time, there are many German tourists here and very often websites for Cretan resources are presented in Greek, English, and German. This has really made me wonder how on earth the people of countries so damaged by Germany ever began to accept Germans as visitors, and how Germans had the confidence to go as tourists.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " I can offer a bit of (partial) information about the return of German tourists in France after 1945.   German people, in the decade following WW2, were not much able to travel for a simple reason: the \"economic miracle\" had yet to materialize, and they had other priorities, such as the reconstruction of their households. From V-Day to the currency reform of June 1948 that took place in the Western occupation zones, German economy was dominated by barter and black market. While the reform had positive effects, people lost their wartime savings. In 1950, an average middle-class German family of four could only spend about 7% of its budget on leisure, recreation and entertainment: the rest of the budget was used for food, rent, heating, power and essential transport (Kopper, 2008). Vacations, if they were feasible, were taken at home or domestically. In addition, the German tourist industry had been thoroughly destroyed. In the early 1950s, it was still about one-third the size it had been in 1936 (Kosha, 2000). It is thus not suprising that the numbers of German visitors (tourists and business) were extremely low in the late 1940s. British statistics show that there were 55000 German visitors in the UK in 1938: they were 1000 in 1946, 8000 in 1947, 18000 in 1948 and 20000 in 1949 (vs 87000 from France the same year).  It was possible for Germans to go to France in the immediate postwar if they had a good reason to do so that was not \"leisure\", such as business, administration, or academia. In August 1945, Jesuit priest and former Resistance member Jean du Rivau founded the Franco-German magazine *Documents/Dokumente* with the purpose of advancing the cause of Franco-German reconciliation. Rivau organized a first meeting of French and German intellectuals in Offenburg, Germany in 1947, and then another one in Royaumont, France in October 1948. Among the German participants were Joseph Rovan, Eugen Kogon, Walter Dirks, and Elisabeth Langg\u00e4sser, who all had been opponents to the Nazi regime (Kogon had spent the entire war in Buchenwald), which certainly gave them proper credentials to visit France (Plum, 2007). They were not \"tourists\", but it shows that the French border was not closed to \"good\" Germans.   Another type of German visitors who were the first to arrive were catholic pilgrims. A German delegation went to Lourdes in 1947 (Courtabessis, 1947) and, two years later, four trains departing from Cologne, Munich, Hannover, and Mainz, transported 1200 German pilgrims, a cardinal and a bishop to Lourdes (*Combat*, 14 July 1949; *L'Aube*, 20 July 1949). In 1950, German visitors in Paris were business people (27%), functionaries (31%), and academics (25%) (*Carrefour*, 25 July 1951).  In 1951, France authorized Germans to get tourist visas. The money they could spend was limited to 500 DM + 100 DM for automobile drivers (this limit was raised in 1953, and removed in 1959). The first \"official\" German tourists spent their time in Paris, Lyon, and the Riviera. Numbers of German visitors grew steadily, from a mere 25,000 in 1949 to 400,000 in 1955, reaching 732,000 in 1961, more than British tourists. Half came by road and 35% by train. They were poorer than British and American tourists, with two-third of German tourists staying in 1-star and 2-star hotels vs 49% for the British and 28% for the Americans. Group visits resumed in 1954 (Ginier, 1963). By then, the German economy had been revived, and its tourist industry was working again, with German tour operators sending people abroad by thousands. In 1958, more West Germans traveled abroad than foreigners visited the Federal Republic (Koshar, 2000).  How were German visitors received in France? An article from 1951 (*Carrefour*, 25 July 1951) presents German tourists in a gently mocking way (\"The Germans have always been very fond of France. In their own way, of course...\"). A cartoon shows a (male) German tourist looking at the Eiffel Tower, at Mona Lisa, at a can-can dancer, and then running (lusting) after a woman. The article describes the tourist attractions preferred by the Germans: museums, religious sites, the Eiffel Tower, music halls, and prostitutes. Concerning the latter, the article recommends that the German tourist presents himself as a Swiss citizen: French prostitutes, while loving foreign customers, are not fond of German ones. The article ends by presenting German tourists as discreet and self-effacing, preferring wine to beer, and avoiding to be identified as German. It concludes:  >In general, he is held by hoteliers, taxi drivers, restaurant owners, transporters, to be \"exact, clean, correct and very disciplined\". The war is already far away...  According to Wackerman (1994):  >The Germans, satisfied on the whole with their stay in France, although often below expectations as regards the quality of the service and the tourist offer in general, still complained repeatedly about the coolness of the welcome in the shops or in the street, the psychological barriers being tenacious in all categories of the population and all age groups; in young people, a \"thawing\" or the absence of rejection was nevertheless noticed.   Genier (1963):  >[The German tourist] does not appreciate the excessive prices charged by a hotel that is questionable for its cleanliness and the vulgarity of its staff. Finally, he would gladly exchange the evening meal, which is too copious, for a modern and better lit room!   From these short and incomplete presentation, it seems that German tourism was normalized rather quickly in France, basically as soon as Germans were able to afford vacationing abroad in the 1950s. France, of course, was counting on foreign tourists, including German ones, to recapture its position as the Number 1 tourist nation in Europe, which it had lost in the late thirties (Commissariat G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Tourisme, 1950). The fact that there was more than 700,000 German tourists in 1961 is an indication that they were relatively well received, with the older generations of French people being somewhat colder to them than the younger one. There were occasional slumps (the Suez crisis in 1956, events linked to the Algeria war) but otherwise German tourists enjoyed going to France, and some even came to revisit the places where they had been stationed during the war (Genier, 1963).  **Sources**  * Board of Trade Journal. \u2018Record Numbers of Overseas Visitors to Britain in 1948\u2019, 19 February 1949. https://archive.org/details/sim_great-britain-board-of-trade-board-of-trade-journal_1949-02-19_156_2722/page/348/mode/2up. * Commissariat G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Tourisme. \u2018Le tourisme \u00e9tranger en France en 1949\u2019.

        "sft_target": " I can offer a bit of (partial) information about the return of German tourists in France after 1945.   German people, in the decade following WW2, were not much able to travel for a simple reason: the \"economic miracle\" had yet to materialize, and they had other priorities, such as the reconstruction of their households. From V-Day to the currency reform of June 1948 that took place in the Western occupation zones, German economy was dominated by barter and black market. While the reform had positive effects, people lost their wartime savings. In 1950, an average middle-class German family of four could only spend about 7% of its budget on leisure, recreation and entertainment: the rest of the budget was used for food, rent, heating, power and essential transport (Kopper, 2008). Vacations, if they were feasible, were taken at home or domestically. In addition, the German tourist industry had been thoroughly destroyed. In the early 1950s, it was still about one-third the size it had been in 1936 (Kosha, 2000). It is thus not suprising that the numbers of German visitors (tourists and business) were extremely low in the late 1940s. British statistics show that there were 55000 German visitors in the UK in 1938: they were 1000 in 1946, 8000 in 1947, 18000 in 1948 and 20000 in 1949 (vs 87000 from France the same year).  It was possible for Germans to go to France in the immediate postwar if they had a good reason to do so that was not \"leisure\", such as business, administration, or academia. In August 1945, Jesuit priest and former Resistance member Jean du Rivau founded the Franco-German magazine *Documents/Dokumente* with the purpose of advancing the cause of Franco-German reconciliation. Rivau organized a first meeting of French and German intellectuals in Offenburg, Germany in 1947, and then another one in Royaumont, France in October 1948. Among the German participants were Joseph Rovan, Eugen Kogon, Walter Dirks, and Elisabeth Langg\u00e4sser, who all had been opponents to the Nazi regime (Kogon had spent the entire war in Buchenwald), which certainly gave them proper credentials to visit France (Plum, 2007). They were not \"tourists\", but it shows that the French border was not closed to \"good\" Germans.   Another type of German visitors who were the first to arrive were catholic pilgrims. A German delegation went to Lourdes in 1947 (Courtabessis, 1947) and, two years later, four trains departing from Cologne, Munich, Hannover, and Mainz, transported 1200 German pilgrims, a cardinal and a bishop to Lourdes (*Combat*, 14 July 1949; *L'Aube*, 20 July 1949). In 1950, German visitors in Paris were business people (27%), functionaries (31%), and academics (25%) (*Carrefour*, 25 July 1951).  In 1951, France authorized Germans to get tourist visas. The money they could spend was limited to 500 DM + 100 DM for automobile drivers (this limit was raised in 1953, and removed in 1959). The first \"official\" German tourists spent their time in Paris, Lyon, and the Riviera. Numbers of German visitors grew steadily, from a mere 25,000 in 1949 to 400,000 in 1955, reaching 732,000 in 1961, more than British tourists. Half came by road and 35% by train. They were poorer than British and American tourists, with two-third of German tourists staying in 1-star and 2-star hotels vs 49% for the British and 28% for the Americans. Group visits resumed in 1954 (Ginier, 1963). By then, the German economy had been revived, and its tourist industry was working again, with German tour operators sending people abroad by thousands. In 1958, more West Germans traveled abroad than foreigners visited the Federal Republic (Koshar, 2000).  How were German visitors received in France? An article from 1951 (*Carrefour*, 25 July 1951) presents German tourists in a gently mocking way (\"The Germans have always been very fond of France. In their own way, of course...\"). A cartoon shows a (male) German tourist looking at the Eiffel Tower, at Mona Lisa, at a can-can dancer, and then running (lusting) after a woman. The article describes the tourist attractions preferred by the Germans: museums, religious sites, the Eiffel Tower, music halls, and prostitutes. Concerning the latter, the article recommends that the German tourist presents himself as a Swiss citizen: French prostitutes, while loving foreign customers, are not fond of German ones. The article ends by presenting German tourists as discreet and self-effacing, preferring wine to beer, and avoiding to be identified as German. It concludes:  >In general, he is held by hoteliers, taxi drivers, restaurant owners, transporters, to be \"exact, clean, correct and very disciplined\". The war is already far away...  According to Wackerman (1994):  >The Germans, satisfied on the whole with their stay in France, although often below expectations as regards the quality of the service and the tourist offer in general, still complained repeatedly about the coolness of the welcome in the shops or in the street, the psychological barriers being tenacious in all categories of the population and all age groups; in young people, a \"thawing\" or the absence of rejection was nevertheless noticed.   Genier (1963):  >[The German tourist] does not appreciate the excessive prices charged by a hotel that is questionable for its cleanliness and the vulgarity of its staff. Finally, he would gladly exchange the evening meal, which is too copious, for a modern and better lit room!   From these short and incomplete presentation, it seems that German tourism was normalized rather quickly in France, basically as soon as Germans were able to afford vacationing abroad in the 1950s. France, of course, was counting on foreign tourists, including German ones, to recapture its position as the Number 1 tourist nation in Europe, which it had lost in the late thirties (Commissariat G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Tourisme, 1950). The fact that there was more than 700,000 German tourists in 1961 is an indication that they were relatively well received, with the older generations of French people being somewhat colder to them than the younger one. There were occasional slumps (the Suez crisis in 1956, events linked to the Algeria war) but otherwise German tourists enjoyed going to France, and some even came to revisit the places where they had been stationed during the war (Genier, 1963).  **Sources**  * Board of Trade Journal. \u2018Record Numbers of Overseas Visitors to Britain in 1948\u2019, 19 February 1949. https://archive.org/details/sim_great-britain-board-of-trade-board-of-trade-journal_1949-02-19_156_2722/page/348/mode/2up. * Commissariat G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Tourisme. \u2018Le tourisme \u00e9tranger en France en 1949\u2019.

    "\n\nHuman: Dealing with Fallout of a Terminated Employee     Hi HR folks and r/AskHR  I am posting so I can get your advice on a tough situation and hopefully gain a different perspective of POV on a weird situation.  I figured my best is to ask the professionals directly!  Thank you in advance for your help - I really do appreciate the time you take to help me out on your personal time.  **Background**  I manage a team of 10 professionals in North Dakota, USA. My team specializes in a highly technical field. The firm is a well established consulting company and is pretty traditional. About a year ago, I hired a former employee of mine from a competing firm. He was a good employee, dependable and a delight to be around when we worked together. I even considered Bill to be a friend and he would often talk on the phone, more often than not he would share things he is struggling with and asked for advice. Let's call him Bill. After a brief amount of time joining me at the new company, Bill recommends I hire his friend Steve. Bill and Steve had worked together recently, and given the respect I had for Bill, I figured Steve would be a good fit for the company and we needed some help. Bill really stuck his neck out for Steve, even though Steve's resume was a little light. I went with it because I figured it to be trustworthy referral and when I have managed teams before, referrals end up being the best employees.  **Here is the skinny**  Steve had a rough start. Very defensive. Prone to emotional outbursts and verbally attacking me. He constantly argued about really simple stuff and saying it wasn't my job to tell him what to do, even though I was his supervisor. HR stepped in and I essentially took the blame for all of this. I was directed to take leadership training and couldn't have any direct communications with Steve unless a 3rd party was involved. I really go thrown under the bus hardcore.  I thought the personal side of things were getting better between Steve and me after the first run-in with HR; however, his technical side of things was not improving. He struggled to meet deadlines. The quality of his stuff was not improving even though it is relatively cookie cutter stuff. He also kept repeating the same mistakes over and over and over. I gave him all the training he asked for but still complained about needing more. And then he started to really lose it. He went back to his old ways but this time, HR saw all what he was doing and everything was being monitored by the 3rd party person. HR essentially came to the conclusion that Steve had to be let ago and he was terminated back in early November 2019.  I got wind recently of the convos between Bill and Steve. All the text, emails, and DMs. Everything. Bill doesn't know this. It appears that Bill and Steve were kinda conspiring against me. This whole time Bill was telling me he was my friend and just wanted everyone to get along . . . but was was telling Steve the times he was going over my head, meeting with HR trying to get Steve to report directly to Bill and bunch of other conniving things to get me fired or demoted. Bill used what I perceived as a friendship to manipulate and take advantage of me. I feel betrayed and has really eroded my trust with about everyone I work with.  **Here is my ask of you**  Now that Steve is gone, how do I go about handling Bill? How I address his behavior and what all do I share with him about what I know happened in the background? Do I not share at all and if so, why? I want Bill to stay for the long term and I want to minimize any interaction with HR. I don't want HR to think I can't manage my team and that they need to step in all the time something goes wrong. if HR is required to step in, I not opposed to doing so, but I don't want to come off as meek or unable to manage a difficult situation. I also have no trust in my company's HR group. I don't want to come off as threatening to Bill or give him the impression of \"its this way or the highway\". That is not my style. I do want to make sure there is no doubt his behavior is unacceptable. How do I use this opportunity to establish that I am the leader of the group and how can I best learn from this situation? How do I further insulate and protect myself so I don't come off as a the bad guy and best protect my job?  There are a bunch of questions out there and I am probably not asking them all here. Any help, suggestions, feedback, or action items would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAssistant:": {

Is this worth going to HR over? At my work, a disturbing trend has started.  Meeting scheduled to start at 9:00am  A female colleague comes in at 8:59am. She'll go \"Hold on, I have to go to the bathroom quick!\"  She'll leave and I'll admit she does come back quickly, for a bathroom break for a man or woman. Like 60 seconds tops.   Somebody will make reference to her quick bathroom break.  She says \"oh yeah, I save time by not washing my hands when I pee.\"  And usually a few people will chuckle.  I thought it was disgusting once but she's done it four times total now.  She does it in meetings with C-suite executives and meetings with her direct reports.  This woman is our VP of operations and has an MBA.  Am I a prude? I just find this topic of conversation disgusting. Nobody needs to know your bathroom habits. I know some people don't wash their hands after going Number 1. Whatever fine, I side on you're touching bathroom surfaces covered in god knows what. But whatever, fine. Why does she need to disclose this, repeatedly. I think it's unbecoming for anybody in a professional setting, let alone a vice president in the organization.

You're unhappy as an employee now bc someone screwed up and gave you information. Does your manager know she fucked up? How will she receive that feedback? If the answer is that you don't believe she will take that feedback appropriately or you think she may retaliate and treat you poorly, then you should proceed to HR without speaking to her about it first. Also, you have two tries to get this right if your coworker is a friend who is good at professional communication.  The other point that I need to make here is that you don't know if that description of her previous experience is everything you need to know about her. It is possible that she has a better skill-set in some other way. She could have more experience in the \"general field\" that's applicable or relevant. You could, unknowingly, be the employee that actually is less qualified than her. Either way, you want to know because you got given the wrong information, bc you're unhappy. ASK the question rather than telling on someone or accusing. Admit you're an unhappy employee now bc of this knowledge and ask, \"Am I less qualified? Bc I want to learn how to further my career and improve my qualifications.\" HR will understand this perspective. It is an employee who is doing there best to be respectful and wishes to be a professional.  Side-note: Tailor your message for who you're trying to communicate with. Obviously I used bad language. That's bc I don't work with you and that's legitimately how I feel about what she did.",

    "\n\nHuman: [NY] I said a culturally inappropriate thing but I didn't know it'll be considered inappropriate. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE HELP. My verbal 95% offer is in jeopardy. Okay, so I am a stupid and dumbass person. I got the verbal offer and as the last step, 'informally', I spoke to Chief Compliance Officer. I mentioned I left my last job due to cultural differences - this person who I was working with was Jewish and other senior officials were Jewish and all other employees in this small company complained about this rude guy and no one took action ever. A lot of people have left the company due to this favouritism, and their inaction towards this person.   Just to clarify - I am from South- East Asia, a Hindu, and I absolutely had no idea it could be taken as anti-semitic (I wasn't cognizant about it). Okay, I am the most idiot person around, but my intention wasn't anti-semitic. Like I don't even know a lot about Judaism and neither do I understand what's the deal with anti-sentiments against them. Tbh, I didn't know the way I was articulating could be construed as anti-semitic.   My intention was not to say the whole section of people are like that. I just meant people in that company and their culture is such. It was a boy's club and they were douchebags and they acted like assholes, rude, disrespectful and condescending. I've been in the U.S for 4 years now but let's just I am a fucking idiot. Now, what can I do to salvage the situation? What can I write or say to make my case? My verbal 95% offer is in jeopardy.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: [Florida] Former manager told me via LinkedIn she's not fired? After the CFO told us she was and gave me her responsibilities. Do I report this or anything? This morning walking into work our CFO called me into his office and said my manager had left the company and asked if I could temporarily handle some of her duties. Then he called the whole department into the conference room and told them. It wasn't entirely unforeseen as our department was severely underperforming.  I go back to my desk and I get a LinkedIn message from my just fired manager asking how things are going. I said good and gave my condolences. She said \"Oh, I haven't left the company. I'm just in negotiations with management over my job.\"  I said, oh, CFO was here and he made it sound it was official you have left the company.  She said she was still talking to them about a different role and she expected to be back with the organization in a week or so.  She sounds nuts? We're having this conversation over LinkedIn not work email which should tell you everything.  Should I report this to management or just ignore her?

    "\n\nHuman: Advice: My friend confided in me that she found possible racist notes about herself in our HR system. Help! Backstory: I\u2019m a corporate recruiter and I\u2019ve been with the company for 2 years. About a year ago we hired an HR generalist and, though she has a lot more HR experience than me, she\u2019s relied on me to help her get acclimated to how our company runs. I\u2019m really close with her and we have a great working relationship and we both love it here. We had an HRM who was very bitchy and a kiss-ass to our VPHR and SVPHR and she left recently to raise a family.   My friend was recently promoted to HRM from Generalist and with that, comes access to a system that tracks/has notes on high level hires for our company (the previous HRM and VPHR and SVPHR are some of the few people that have access to this system).   My HRM just confided in me that when she got access to the system, she searched herself (to see what pertinent info needed to be added to new entries). In the notes section of her file was \u201cSr lvl HRG from competitor - Token\u201d. Being that she is a black lady, she was immediately upset to think she was only hired for diversity, not for her experience. She is the only black person on our team.   She called me and asked for advice and I\u2019m not even sure where to begin. I can only imagine what she\u2019s feeling. The former (bitchy) HRM was the person entering information previously, (and she\u2019s no longer with us) but we can\u2019t track who made the notes...  State: NY\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: [CA] My remote job wants me to install a monitoring software on my personal device. Not sure if this is the right sub... but please direct me to a better sub if it's not.  My remote job wants me to install a monitoring software on my personal device.   As context, I am a social media and Marketing Manager for a nonprofit. We do not have work-issued laptops, so I use my personal laptop. Yesterday, management reached out and told me I need to install a remote management software, and I feel really uncomfortable as I think it\u2019s used to monitor our productivity at work, and I\u2019m not 100% sure who can see what. It just seems really intrusive to have on my personal device.   That being said - in my contract, I agreed to using my personal device for work, and I also agreed to \u201ccomplying with cyber security policies.\u201d I didn\u2019t know the extent would be downloaded a full tracking software.   I asked the outsourced IT department that installed the program to give me more info, and this is what they said: The remote management software keeps a record of the computer name, version of Mac OS, last time it was online, and the last user that logged into the computer. It doesn't record any information about your files. \u201c  This made me feel a little better that my every waking moment isn\u2019t being tracked and recorded on my personal device, but it still frustrates me. My computer is running a little slower since it was installed.   I would love insight into whether this dynamic is normal, especially for a remote company.  It makes me uncomofortable, but the person who is mandating this is the CFO/COO AND the HR lead. So there's nobody I feel comfortable talking to about it.   I understand cyber security is important, especially since I have access to their donor database and social media accounts.\n\nAssistant:": {

It very likely has the ability to log all your keystrokes.  It very likely has the ability to completely lock you out of your computer and only allow them to unlock it.  It likely has the ability to install fake SSL certificates so that it can intercept your private email (if you login to your personal Gmail for example) and read the contents.  Will the company do anything with all that information? Likely not. But are you comfortable with them having all of that? I know I wouldn't be.  What do the \"cyber security policies\" say?  Also note if the IT department included the word only when they said \"The remote management software keeps a record of the computer name, version of Mac OS, last time it was online, and the last user that logged into the computer. It doesn't record any information about your files\"  It doesn't need to record information about your files in order to intercept your browsing history, for example.  Did they say \"The remote management software ONLY keeps a record of the computer name, version of Mac OS, last time it was online, and the last user that logged into the computer.\"?",

            " \"You're probably right, in the same sense that Einstein's theories of relativity are 'useless' to you or to me but when we look beyond the immediate benefits such things accrue to us as we explore the depth of the ideas, you can probably find something 'useful' to you in one way or another. I engage in philosophy from time to time because it is amusing and sometimes stimulating. Most people don't really need to engage in philosophy because most people can function without philosophy, that is, *critical philosophy*. Whether you think philosophy is useless or not, I can say this with certainty: you have philosophical prejudices and philosophers have probably criticized those already. For example, if you are a non-vegan, there is a significant philosophical literature on why killing animals for meat alone, which is not necessarily the same as *eating* meat, is an immoral practice. To build an industry around it with the animals in cruel conditions is on another level of immoral. If you think these prejudices are 'obvious', it's probably because you have absorbed the philosophical attitude at some point already: you already have a philosophical prejudice. Or if you think these \"philosophical problems\" can be solved by science, whatever that means, then that in itself is a philosophical prejudice. Philosophy is most 'useful' in combating these philosophical prejudices and improving our prejudices. I engage c*ritically* with philosophy and through philosophy because it is stimulating to my critically minded attitude. You don't need to engage in philosophy, no one can force you to. That doesn't mean you should denigrate philosophy, or philosophers, or those who engage in philosophy because they find it interesting.\"",

He will be trailed, of course, by the philosopher furiously hurling philosophical imprecations: \"What do you mean, you're willing to be irrational? You shouldn't be irrational because...\" And although the philosopher is embarrassed by his inability to complete this sentence in a noncircular fasion - he can only produce reasons for accepting reasons - still, he is unwilling to let his adversary go.  > Wouldn't it be better if philosophical arguments left the person no possible answer at all, reducing him to impotent silence?

            " Considering it a philosophy or not depends on the author, so it can be considered both a philosophical doctrine and a religion depending on the theory of knowledge you apply.

            " Basically, there are a few mystical elements to it, so it's not pure philosophy.",
            " Why would Buddhism not be considered a religion and only a philosophy? It seems to have many elements that we consider religious. Monastic orders, the sutra are close to what you could consider holy scriptures, relics, rituals where you pray to the Buddha / Bodhisattva / local gods (the last bit depends a bit on your school though) for help, a comprehensive cosmology with various heavens, hells and our world, a theory of life after death, and there are many mystical aspects too.   I personally wouldn't mind ditching out the word \"religion\" entirely when talking about Eastern (and even, in general, non-western) faiths and religious systems, because the word religion was born in Europe and applies mostly to Christianity (see how Lactantius and Augustine shaped the meaning of this word, and how we got from the roman religio to the contemporary religion), and the word religion only appeared in East Asia in the 19th century. But so should be said of \"philosophy\", that is also a concept that, in itself, didn't exist in East Asia before the 19th century. East Asians didn't have the idea that they were doing philosophy, or that they were being religious before the 19th century. So if you were to follow that approach, Buddhism is Buddhism, and it's pointless to call it either a philosophy or a religion, and even to debate if it is closer to the former than to the later, because this is not something that the Buddhists really had in mind when they were practicing their faith^1.   A caveat with this argument is that even if religion and philosophy are two words that have been \"imported\" into East Asia around 150 years ago, they may still be used to say something about Buddhism, Daoism, etc. After all, \"Antiquity\", and \"Middle ages\" are also two words that have been crafted long after these periods have ended, and neither Homer nor Charlemagne felt like they were living in \"The Anquity\" or in the \"Middle-Ages\" respectively, but, as imperfect as these two historical categories may be, they still seem to be able to convey something that rings true to us, historically speaking. So maybe that works with philosophy and religion, and I do think it does. After all, I have listed, in the beginning of this answer, various aspects of Buddhism that may seem very religious and, to be honest, I have never seen any argument explaining me why Buddhism should not be considered a religion convincing.    ___________________   1. You can make the argument that indeed Chinese (and, therefore, all the rest of the Chinese-influenced world, most notably Korea, Japan and Vietnam) still had some sort of distinction between philosophy and religion, but I personally don't know to what extent it holds, so I will write about it here, but that's just for information purpose. Confucianism and Daoism are written each in three ways possible in Chinese \u5112\u6559\u3001\u5112\u5bb6\u3001\u5112\u5b66 (Confucianism) and \u9053\u6559\u3001\u9053\u5bb6\u3001\u9053\u5b66\uff08Daoism). As you can notice, the first character is always the same \u5112 is \"Ru\" and means a Confucianist (before that it was a bit different, but now it refers mostly to a Confucianist), and \u9053 is the famous \"Dao\", or the way if you prefer. Then comes \u6559 which means \"teachings\", and so emphasises Confucianism and Daoism has beeing sort of \"lineages\" with a transmission of texts, etc. \u5bb6 means \"house\", and so will tend to emphasize the Ru and the Daoists as being a sort of \"family of philosophers\", or maybe, to sound less awkward, a \"school\". \u5b66 means \"studies\", which I think doesn't need that much of a commentary. What about Buddhism and Islam then? Do they also use the three suffixes? Nope. Buddhism is \u4f5b\u6559, and only has the \u6559 suffix (\u4f5b means Buddha). There is no \"Buddha Studies\" or \"Buddha house\". Islam is \u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u6559 (\u4f0a\u65af\u5170 is a phonetic transliteration of Islam). Christianity is \u57fa\u7763\u6559. Once again, for Islam and Christianity, no \u5b66 and no \u5bb6. Only \u6559. Which is puzzling, so you could very well make the point, and I find it very convincing even though I am not a specialist and don't feel confident saying \"it is true\" with 100% confidence that \u6559, without being a 100% equivalent of religion, is damn close to designating what the West thinks as being religion (and, in the case of Daoism and Confucianism, emphasizes their *very* religious aspects).",

    "\n\nHuman: Does Judith Jarvis Thompson's violinist argument also argue against the enforcement of coronavirus lockdowns? Has anyone written about this? Thompson argues that we cannot be restricted in our bodily autonomy even if is to guarantee the life of another. During the ongoing coronavirus crisis many governmental forces have instituted large-scale lockdowns that restrict people's bodily autonomy greatly, under the justification that it will save lives.  Within the violinist scenario also, there is also a *certainty* of a person dying by unplugging, whereas in the current crisis there is no certainty that leaving ones house or going out in public will certainly lead to someone dying of the virus.   Given that - according to Thompson - no one has any obligation to restrict themselves in this way, the acceptance of this argument would seem to also push one to reject the enforced lockdowns we have seen throughout 2020.  Since this argument is highly regarded in academia, has anyone written about its intersection with coronavirus measures?

    "\n\nHuman: Physics degree later in life Hi all. I got a bachelor's degree in philosophy about eighteen years ago, and now, as a 40-year old, I want to pursue a degree in physics. I fully understand that at my age there will be almost no viable career options as a physicist. I figure I could teach at a high school or something, but my main motivation is that life is short, and the chance to get a glimpse into how the universe works before we're out of here is invaluable.   I'm finding most public universities aren't keen on accepting adults who already possess a bachelor's degree, so my question is if anyone knows of a good program for people like me, or if anyone has been in the same boat and has any advice.  Thanks!\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Why is it dark at night? (actually a physics question, I promise) I was thinking about the structure of the universe, the distance of objects close to the edge of the observable universe, Doppler shift, background radiation and stuff, and I had a sudden realization that I'm wondering about:  Given that space itself is mostly empty, and therefore colorless, is the night sky dark because of one or a combination of the following factors?  A) (this is the big one for me) the sky is mostly dark because even if we could see infinitely distant, there was a time in the early universe before there was light, and that was true for the whole universe at the time, therefore as we look back in time the more distant we see, everything is dark.  B) very distant objects and early structures are receding from us so fast that their light will never reach us.  C) light from very distant objects gets absorbed or reflected by whatever atoms or molecules get in the way, and because the distances are so insignificant great, even though space is a NEAR vacuum, there are so many atoms between us and the edge of the observable universe that most early light never makes it to us.  *Bonus thought that I also might posit as its own question: Given a distance of let's say 5 billion light years between two points in space-time, not objects just positions in the universe: Since the early days of the universe they've remained proportionally the same distance apart, but observationally would they appear more distant from each other? Because space is expanding - so the \"length or size\" of a unit of distance is expanding - for example due to the expansion of the universe the proportional distance between millimeters stays the same, but the space between subatomic particles ever so slightly grows, as does the size of a millimeter. It's still just one millimeter, but would it seem longer than it did a long time ago? Does that mean time is getting longer as well? If we define a second as so many oscillations of a certain atom, but the distance that atom has to swing is growing, does that mean that the length of a unit of time is expanding too? If a person from today were to count seconds in 5B years, would our person seem to tick seconds off too fast?*\n\nAssistant:": {

To a radio telescope, the sky is uniformly bright - it is filled with the cosmic microwave background.  As for your second question you have some misunderstandings. The length between two distant points does grow (the number of rulers that one could fit between them is greater now than in the past) but the space between atoms does not.

A rule-of-thumb power level for received light from the sun is max around 1300 watts per square meter of ground, in full on sunlight. From there it drops very rapidly for low angle sun, clouds, aerosols etc.. Your microwave is a tiny box and it's 2000 w.  Given that you've got the same focusing and the same absorbance (which isn't to be taken for granted), you'd get the same amount of power out of 2 kw of microwave and 2 kw sunlight. This effect would only be heating. But with sunlight parts of it would be in the uv range which is ionizing and so it has much higher potential for harm for living creatures.  If you want some context to this, try to imagine what 2 kw of light is actually like. I've got LED ceiling lights that consume something like 10 w and they're pretty damn bright, and I don't know their exact efficiency but it's not close to 100%. Put 200 of those inside a microwave-oven sized box and I sure as hell don't want to be in there with them.",

The high pressure air flows up over the top of the wall, and the zone directly on the other side becomes relatively low pressure. The high pressure air then naturally flows downwards to fill in the low pressure zone, effectively creating a \"new\" wind directly down the wall. More turbulence ensues and the wind continues on it's original trajectory.   You can try this yourself by standing directly behind a wall on a windy day. You won't feel wind pushing you in a particular direction, but you will feel it blowing randomly. The same effect happens when you drive a convertible - the windshield seems like it should block the wind but it really just creates a pressure differential. In the past, farmers and even whole towns have used trees and other large plants to reduce the wind. The wind finds its way through the obstacles, but loses energy as it does so."

            " **EDIT: I'm done**  Sorry for the delay, real work called. So, I wrote a program that takes n 52 card decks, and shuffles them the standard way (so many chunks, front to back). User setable are: how many decks you use, how many times you drop the cards from front to back, how many times you get the same card in a row before you consider it poorly shuffled, how many times you get the same suite in a row before it is poorly shuffled, and how many times cards need to be in consecutive order before you consider it poorly shuffled.   Decks were initialized using the order than new decks normally come in, all the cards of a single suite in numeric order from smallest to largest.   Using a single deck of cards, assuming for \"drops\" per shuffle, that you would dislike having three of the same type of card in a row, 4 of the same suite in a row, or three consecutive cards in a row, and running it 10,000 times you get an answer of 12.4 shuffles.   Using two decks instead of 1, but then doubling the amount of drops per shuffle from 4 to 8, running 10,000 times, the answer is 16.8.   The number of cards consecutive in a suite being raised to 5 lowers the average of the single deck from 12.4 to 9.3.   I'll copy my MATLAB code to a comment on this topic.

            " No, the total surface air of a merged bubble will be less. Remember that volume is proportional to radius cubed, but surface area is proportional to radius squared, and as you are going from 2 bubbles to 1, your radius increases not by a factor of 2 but by the cube root of 2.  If the bubbles have radius of r, they will each have the volume (4/3)\\*pi\\*r\\^3, or about 4.18 r\\^3. The surface area will be 4\\*pi\\*r\\^2, or about  12.5 r\\^2. The merged bubble will have double the volume 8.36 r\\^3 = (4/3)\\*pi\\*R\\^3 where the big R is the radius of the merged bubble. R will be exactly r\\*(2\\^(1/3)). The sum of the bubble surface areas was 25 r\\^2, but the merged bubble will have a surface area of 4\\*pi\\*(r\\*(2\\^(1/3))\\^2 = 20 r\\^2. So the merged bubble will lose about a fifth of the total surface area.",
            " As shown by the math in other comments, the surface area would decrease. I can also bring in perspective from the chemistry side. For an interface between two different materials, there is an energy penalty for the dangling bonds. For the case of water, it's the hydrogen bonds between the molecules.   Thus, over time the microstructure will change to minimize this \"surface energy\". An effective way of doing this is growing. The volume will be larger, but the amount of material at the boundary will be lesser than two separate bubbles; thereby decreasing the number of dangling bonds. In essence, this is the same phenomenon as coarsening in alloys. Whereby, given enough time and atomic motion,  the different phases within the alloys will separate and form larger chunks, something known as coarsening.",

            " No, and one way to think about it is that two bubbles merge BECAUSE their surface areas are less when they are one. If they can have less surface area (by merging), then that's what they 'want' to do. That is also why spheres show up so often in nature. They have the most stuff inside and the least stuff outside. A sphere is the 'lowest energy' when it comes to surface area.",

            " Basic answer: No.  Full Answer: It is complicated.  The surface area is the result of the placement of volume.  For a basic bubble, a bubble will typically form a spherical shape, which \"should\" have the lowest surface area per volume.  I am going to use a circle for the example because the math is simpler than a sphere.  You have 2 bubbles on 1 unit radius.  Circumference (the equivalent to surface area) is 2\\*r\\*Pi, or 6.28 units.  The area (equivalent to volume) is Pi\\*(r\\^2), or 3.14.  If the 2 circles merge, the area will be the sum of the 2 areas, or 6.28.  Likewise, 2 bubbles merge, they will have the sum of the 2 volumes.  From the 6.28, we need to recalculate r, the radius.  This new circle has a radius of 1.414 (square root of 2).  The new circumference is around 8.88, a far ways off from the individual circumferences of 6.28, or 12.56.  Why is my answer also \"It's complicated\"?  Again, the surface area is a result of how the volume is distributed.  If the air bubble is going through a pipe, the volume is the same, but the pipe will alter the shape.  The air bubble will form in a shape of \"path of least resistance\".  In a pipe, the tubing will (should\u2122) apply more resistance than the fluid around the bubble, so the air will displace more of the fluid than displace the pipe.  For the example of surface area versus volume displacement, I will use cubes because the math is much simpler.  I have 8 cubes of area volume.  These 8 cubes will fill 8 1 cube cavities, granting a surface area of 48 squares, 8 cubes with all 6 sides exposed each.  I take the 8 cubes and place in 4 2-cube cavities in a rectangle.  Each cavity has a surface area of 10 because I have 4 2-square sides and 2 1-square sides, for a total of 40 squares of surface area.  Lets skip the pair of 4s and go to 3 shapes of an 8 cube cavity.  First 8 cube cavity is a line of 8.  There are 4 8-square sides and 2 1-square sides, giving us 34 squares of surface area.  Second 8 cube cavity is a 4x2x1 rectangular prism.  This is 4 long by 2 wide by 1 height.  I have 2 sides that are 4x2 (8), 2 sides that are 4x1 (4), and 2 sides that are 2x1 (2).  This shape has a 28 square surface area.  The third 8 cube cavity is a 2x2x2 cube.  I have 6 sides with 2x2 (4) squares.  This has a surface area of 24 squares.  &#x200B;  How can an air bubble gain more surface area in real life?  You can have an air bubble that is sandwiched between 2 fluids of different densities, where the air bubble has the appropriate density to float in between the 2.  Its shape can be turned more disc shape as it navigates between the sorted out fluids.  This disc shape would have more surface area than a sphere.  The air bubbles could float up as a sphere and then turn into a disc as they merge together between the layers.  In most cases, the answer to maintaining the same total surface area is a firm \"No\".  Circumstances exist that can allow this answer to be \"Yes\", but these are highly circumstantial, non-zero chance.",
            " No. The volume remains the same\\*, but you're going from a non-minimal surface-area arrangement (two spheres\\*\\*) to a minimal surface-area arrangement; the combined surface area will be smaller. You can compute how the surface area scales fairly easily with those conditions and it will be approximately correct.  \\* at least, nearly the same  \\*\\* rather, nearly spheres",

    "\n\nHuman: How do we know the Milkyway is a spiral galaxy and not some other shape? The Milkyway is always described as a spiral galaxy in shape and that we are located in one of the outer arms, but how do we know that? When seen in pictures in the night sky it looks elongated but that's about all you can say about that view. I know there are lots of dust clouds which hide a lot of the visible light and contributes to the blochyness of the view we see in the sky. I also know that various frequencies of non visible light can get through the dust letting us make some observations through it. So how much of this conclusion is based on assumptions made from observations of other galaxies and how much of it is from direct observations?\n\nAssistant:": {

What I can tell you, however, is that if we were able to obtain the distance of stars, it's a relatively trivial matter to assemble all the data into the shape of a galaxy. Observations made from the surface of the earth can be easily converted into a global coordinate system using latitude, longitude, season, time, precession cycle of the earth, and a few others. We do it in computer graphics all the time. If you're curious about this process, I suggest you look at this article for starters.",

Mammals on the other hand, developed a vertical gait, and mammals that adapted to a marine environment developed tails that follow this movement, i.e. moving up and down. This has happened separately several times in evolutionary history.  Mermaids have developed a tail that utilizes vertical undulations rather than a lateral one.   Therefore Merfolk are mammals. Their entire flesh would be the same, mammals flesh. As they are a subspecies of humanity (perhaps Homo Maritimus is a good taxonomic designation) they would probably taste similar to us, and some have said that human flesh tastes like pork.",

    "\n\nHuman: [Star Wars] Why is everybody ok with droid slavery? Unfortunately this is a somewhat contentious topic, but lets try and keep things civil and within sub rules.  1) So, through Star Wars, most of the main characters are opposed to slavery of organics, and many galactic governments (try to) prohibit it. Some characters make efforts to free slaves when they find them.   2) Some robots are clearly sentient/salient/people, with intelligence, emotions and capabilities equal to those of organics. Despite this, droids are not seen as people and are freely traded and owned as property even under governments that ban slavery.  3) these two facts seem to be in conflict with eachother. Why do Jedi who are willing to risk their lives to save organic slaves not bat an eye about droid slavery?\n\nAssistant:": {

I have read a lot of opinions lately that say that the fact that very different European economies with different specializations and needs are on the same currency and under the same monetary regime is a fundamental flaw in the Euro project. However, it seems like the same thing is basically true in the United States, so I wonder why we don't see the same kind of crises and divergences there that we are seeing between the \"core\" and \"periphery\" in Europe?

            " It *is* a huge problem, but the US has a fairly rational system of federal insurance and risk transfers, entitlement and infrastructure spending, etc. that mitigate the worst effects on the states that arise from using an 'external' currency.   Krugman for example writes about the 1980s Savings & Loan scandal. Thumbnail summary and full audit reports here:  >During the 1980s, the savings and loan industry experienced severe financial losses because extremely high interest rates caused institutions to pay high rates on deposits and other funds while earning low yields on their long-term loan portfolios. During this period, regulators reduced capital standards and allowed the use of alternative accounting procedures to increase reported capital levels. While these conditions were occurring, institutions were allowed to diversify their investments into potentially more profitable, but risky, activities. **The profitability of many of these activities depended heavily on continued inflation in real estate values to make them economically viable**. In many cases, diversification was accompanied by inadequate internal controls and noncompliance with laws and regulations, thus further increasing the risk of these activities.  >As a result of these factors, many institutions experienced substantial losses on their loans and investments, a condition that was made worse by an economic downturn.    Sound familiar?   Krugman points out that around 60% of the S&L losses occurred in Texas, which amounted to about $75 billion in direct federal aid to that one state. Krugman points out that this aid wasn't in the form of loans that Texas had to pay back, nor did the government assume an equity stake in exchange for the aid; instead this was just an outright transfer of capital from taxpayers to banks and their counterparties in order to bail them out of terrible high-risk investments. $75 billion at the time amounted to 25% of Texas' total GDP. Can you imagine Germany & France agreeing to simply grant 25% of Greece's pre-crisis GDP in Euros with few strings attached? Krugman remarks:   >I think you can make a strong case that if Texas had been an independent country in 1986-87 it would have experienced a huge financial and fiscal crisis.    Indeed. So why did US taxpayers & Congress agree to this massive bailout for a single state? The answer is that they didn't, or not exactly. The bailout was basically automatic, as federal depository insurance corporations and regulators like FDIC, FSLIC, FHLBB and so forth stepped in to stop the bleeding before it could spread into an even wider bank crisis and recession. Later the FTC was created to unwind the accounts of several thousand \"zombie\" banks that collapsed during the crisis.   So one answer to your question is that the US has much stronger & more effective federal insurance provisions designed to mitigate bank failures, as well as other economic (and state budget) crises.

Krugman for example writes about the 1980s Savings & Loan scandal. Thumbnail summary and full audit reports here:  >During the 1980s, the savings and loan industry experienced severe financial losses because extremely high interest rates caused institutions to pay high rates on deposits and other funds while earning low yields on their long-term loan portfolios. During this period, regulators reduced capital standards and allowed the use of alternative accounting procedures to increase reported capital levels. While these conditions were occurring, institutions were allowed to diversify their investments into potentially more profitable, but risky, activities. **The profitability of many of these activities depended heavily on continued inflation in real estate values to make them economically viable**. In many cases, diversification was accompanied by inadequate internal controls and noncompliance with laws and regulations, thus further increasing the risk of these activities.  >As a result of these factors, many institutions experienced substantial losses on their loans and investments, a condition that was made worse by an economic downturn.    Sound familiar?   Krugman points out that around 60% of the S&L losses occurred in Texas, which amounted to about $75 billion in direct federal aid to that one state. Krugman points out that this aid wasn't in the form of loans that Texas had to pay back, nor did the government assume an equity stake in exchange for the aid; instead this was just an outright transfer of capital from taxpayers to banks and their counterparties in order to bail them out of terrible high-risk investments. $75 billion at the time amounted to 25% of Texas' total GDP. Can you imagine Germany & France agreeing to simply grant 25% of Greece's pre-crisis GDP in Euros with few strings attached? Krugman remarks:   >I think you can make a strong case that if Texas had been an independent country in 1986-87 it would have experienced a huge financial and fiscal crisis.    Indeed. So why did US taxpayers & Congress agree to this massive bailout for a single state? The answer is that they didn't, or not exactly. The bailout was basically automatic, as federal depository insurance corporations and regulators like FDIC, FSLIC, FHLBB and so forth stepped in to stop the bleeding before it could spread into an even wider bank crisis and recession. Later the FTC was created to unwind the accounts of several thousand \"zombie\" banks that collapsed during the crisis.

Increased population means more mentally unstable people, increased information means it's easier to find a target, and increased transportation means that it's much faster to get wherever you need to go. In addition to that, our techniques for killing people have gotten better and better as the years have gone on, which means that a person should have an increased chance of success when they *do* attempt assassination.

            " The easiest, most proximate answer is that years of mismanagement and corruption have left many of the banks unable to invest in projects that would make them a global player, and when they do, they (seemingly invariably) end up making bad investments. German banks required the largest bailouts of any European bank after the recent recession, and they were heavily involved in the subprime mortgage fiasco that brought done hundreds of American banks. A bigger picture, more systemic answer is that even absent the mismanagement the German banking system is organized differently from ours, with many/most banks owned by local governments, and often used to serve the interests of those local governments. In general they don't operate in the cutthroat capitalistic way American banks do, instead acting as a semi-corrupt, or at least easily corrupted, arm of regional political concerns, and don't make any attempt to move into international finance.   Here's a good, and recent, article that goes into some detail on their current situation.",
            " Bankers Trust, a major US investment had some issues with Derivatives after it sold some overly complex OTC products to people like Orange County and Proctor and Gamble. Essentially they had to settle and ended up needing a rich partner.  Deutsche were interested and as a rich retail bank with an underdeveloped investment banking division, this worked out well. Deutsche became dominant.   Behind them was Dresdner, also very well developed on the retail front and they joined with a UK investment bank,  Kleinwort Benson to form DKB. London was where the IB was happening but the show was sponsored with the money coming from the German retail investors.   There was also Commerzbank which had again a mostly retail operation in Germany but a thriving IB division in London (I forget who they took over). Commerzbank was being chased by DKB.   Finally there was HVB who were again mostly retail but were aggressively chasing IB business.   Along came Lehmann. The point is that many of the IB operations were run at arm's length so it was really a trigger for something that was probably going to happen anyway.   HVB had  big problems and it finally ended up being taken over by an Italian banking group, Unicredit. DKB had big problems but the Germans did not want to lose another major bank so they looked for a partner, Commerzbank to take over but the insurance business from both went to Allianz. Commerzbank was very active overseas but it had to consolidate it's operations. Deutsche had issues with a joint venture with Commerzbank for property investment called EuroHypo which had major problems with mortgage backed securities. Luckily for Deutsche, the venture was majority owned by Commerz so they took the hit politically but financially Deutsche had issues too. Commerz had government support to take over Dresdner but as a condition they had to keep as many German jobs as possible so they also were forced to curtail their overseas activities.   Underneath the big banks are the regional banks. In general they had a good retail base but were under pressure to increase their returns which is why banks like WestLB started playing in London, but without the boards really being aware of the risk that their investment banking activities worked under. Many of them had big issues.  At the same time the EU was applying pressure on the German government to remove the state guarantees for these banks.

        "sft_target": " Bankers Trust, a major US investment had some issues with Derivatives after it sold some overly complex OTC products to people like Orange County and Proctor and Gamble. Essentially they had to settle and ended up needing a rich partner.  Deutsche were interested and as a rich retail bank with an underdeveloped investment banking division, this worked out well. Deutsche became dominant.   Behind them was Dresdner, also very well developed on the retail front and they joined with a UK investment bank,  Kleinwort Benson to form DKB. London was where the IB was happening but the show was sponsored with the money coming from the German retail investors.   There was also Commerzbank which had again a mostly retail operation in Germany but a thriving IB division in London (I forget who they took over). Commerzbank was being chased by DKB.   Finally there was HVB who were again mostly retail but were aggressively chasing IB business.   Along came Lehmann. The point is that many of the IB operations were run at arm's length so it was really a trigger for something that was probably going to happen anyway.   HVB had  big problems and it finally ended up being taken over by an Italian banking group, Unicredit. DKB had big problems but the Germans did not want to lose another major bank so they looked for a partner, Commerzbank to take over but the insurance business from both went to Allianz. Commerzbank was very active overseas but it had to consolidate it's operations. Deutsche had issues with a joint venture with Commerzbank for property investment called EuroHypo which had major problems with mortgage backed securities. Luckily for Deutsche, the venture was majority owned by Commerz so they took the hit politically but financially Deutsche had issues too. Commerz had government support to take over Dresdner but as a condition they had to keep as many German jobs as possible so they also were forced to curtail their overseas activities.   Underneath the big banks are the regional banks. In general they had a good retail base but were under pressure to increase their returns which is why banks like WestLB started playing in London, but without the boards really being aware of the risk that their investment banking activities worked under. Many of them had big issues.  At the same time the EU was applying pressure on the German government to remove the state guarantees for these banks. So the Landesbank were forced to curtail their activities.   Below that were the savings banks. These go down to the size of individual towns or cities.

        "rejected_target": " The easiest, most proximate answer is that years of mismanagement and corruption have left many of the banks unable to invest in projects that would make them a global player, and when they do, they (seemingly invariably) end up making bad investments. German banks required the largest bailouts of any European bank after the recent recession, and they were heavily involved in the subprime mortgage fiasco that brought done hundreds of American banks. A bigger picture, more systemic answer is that even absent the mismanagement the German banking system is organized differently from ours, with many/most banks owned by local governments, and often used to serve the interests of those local governments. In general they don't operate in the cutthroat capitalistic way American banks do, instead acting as a semi-corrupt, or at least easily corrupted, arm of regional political concerns, and don't make any attempt to move into international finance.   Here's a good, and recent, article that goes into some detail on their current situation."

    "\n\nHuman: Why do men commit like... all of the crimes? 70-80% is not a small number. Even with single perpetrator crimes men are in the 70 - 80% range. And this is just in general. In some categories (like serial killars and molestors) they're in the top 90%.  I've seen many men argue that women just \"get away with crimes more easily.\" But no way in this earthly hell is so many crimes unreported that molestation cases get skewed to 90+% male from 50-50. It would be the number one biggest issue in law right now. It would be a complete failure of the law system that every criminal analyst would able to pinpoint with a spear. I'm not buying that as even 10% of the explanation.  I've briefly researched this for an hour and these statistics basically hold true all over the world. The only category women are overepresended is with crimes related to prostitution (or like things cis men can't do like illegal abortions)  Why are men responsible for close to all crime?

            " I find it funny that when it comes to men, all of a sudden, the top voted comment jumps immediately to biology as an answer. It seems that only when it comes to sex differences that paint men in a bad light, genes are an acceptable answer. Then again, \"it's socialisation\" as an answer also allows for breaking down the idea of sex, so that's likely to be second. Here is an article written a while ago, that goes over some of the very large discrimination against men in terms of the justice system, and how that would impact the rates you'd see in prison. I will note that you should ignore the title, as it's just meant to be a bit provocative. I think it's fairly obvious that genes do play a role though, with high testosterone linked to more aggression which can obviously lead to more violence, and this will likely be even more true in the extremes. It's some combination of men obviously being more aggressive by nature, men still being expected to provide, and the huge gender bias in perception and thus reports, arrests, sentencing, etc.",
            " This is a complex topic with few strongly established answers (as far as I am concerned). Interest in female offending (more often with respect to the gender gap in offending) has increased substantially over the past few decades, but there are still many unknowns. Before continuing, I invite reading sociologist Kruttschnitt (2013) summary of what research on gender and crime has found (click here).  --- Gender & Gendered differences (socialization, criminalization, etc.) --- Broadly speaking, two popular lines of research concern gendered socialization and differential treatment according to gender. For illustration, I quote criminologist Rosemary Gartner (2011):  >**If the sexes are more alike than different in the nature of their criminal behavior and the factors associated with it, why are they so different in the levels of their offending? One important reason is sex differences in socialization practices and family supervision that encourage conventional behavior among girls and risk-taking behavior among boys** (Hagan 1988). Girls are less likely to engage in delinquent acts because they are socialized to fear risky behaviors, to develop empathy for others, to value close personal and family relationships, and to avoid aggression; and because they are likely to spend more time with family members and other girls who reinforce conventional behavior. In contrast, boys are typically encouraged to value risk-taking, to associate masculinity with physical power and control, and to prize autonomy and independence; and they are likely to spend their time with male peers who reinforce these characteristics. **Delinquent activities for boys then tend to be more rewarding and more affirming of their identities. These tendencies are reinforced as boys and girls move into adolescence and early adulthood, when women\u2019s criminal opportunities are more limited than men\u2019s, and women\u2019s family responsibilities make the costs of crime greater for them** (Steffensmeier and Allan 1996).  The second line of research is concerned with the differences in how men and women are perceived, conceptualized, and treated by society and its institutions. For instance, for crime to happen, you need opportunity (e.g. see Clarke, 2012). Men and women tend not to share the same roles, statuses, lifestyles and routine activities, therefore there are differences not only in socialization but also in crime opportunities (e.g. see historical trends below). There is also the matter of how society reacts/responds to men and women's behaviors (e.g. with respect to the criminal justice system, see the chivalry hypothesis, the concept of judicial paternalism, and the evil woman hypothesis).  --- How the gap varies through time and space --- For a recent illustration of how the sociopolitical context matters, see Savolainen et al. (2017). Analyzing data collected by the ISRD-2, the WVS, and the GII, find that the gender gap in delinquency varies according to differences in national environments:  >The results of our analyses offer qualified evidence that **the degree of patriarchy in a society is in fact related to the gender gap in delinquency.** The results from a series of multilevel regression models showed consistent support for the hypothesis that patriarchal national environment moderates the association between gender and delinquent offending: **The average \u201cmale effect\u201d on delinquency was observed to be the largest among nations that adhere to more patriarchal gender norms and where the position of women in the social structure is the most disadvantaged.** This finding was robust in analyses aimed at examining the hypothesized interaction effect across four measures of both delinquency and patriarchy. In other words, we found a statistically significant and positive cross-level interaction effect in each of the 16 models estimated.  Also see historical research on crime which shows that the gender gap under discussion is not invariant across time. Here is the first paragraph of social historian of crime Van der Heijden's review of *Women and Crime, 1750-2000* (2016):  >**It is generally observed by criminologists that women are responsible for a smaller proportion of indictable offenses than men**: approximately 13 percent of all prosecution in Europe (Aebi et al. 2010, p. 195). **This strong gender difference in criminal behavior is generally linked to the dissimilar public lifestyles of men and women: the fact that women have less freedom and fewer opportunities may cause a lower participation by women in crime and may also lead to more lenient treatment by prosecutors** (Pollak 1950; Adler 1975; Arnot & Usborne 2003; Burke 2006; Silvestri & Crowther-Dowey 2008, p. 27). Furthermore, **scholars generally assume that the sex differences in recorded crime have been consistent across time**, stressing the continuity rather than change in men\u2019s excessive contribution to criminality (Heidensohn 1996; Burkhead 2006, p. 50; Silvestri & Crowther-Dowey 2008, pp. 26, 191). **However, historical data on early modern Europe show that in France, England, and the Netherlands, between 1600 and 1800 women played a much more prominent role in crime than they did in the twentieth century** (Farge 1974; Feeley 1991; Feeley 1994; King 2006; Spierenburg 2008, p. 117; Van der Heijden 2013; Van der Heijden 2014).  And here is part of the conclusion:  >Sociologist Steffensmeier and behavioral scientist Allan argue that scholars should distinguish between the types of offenses committed by women and the explanation for their crimes. They agree that there is variability across time in the female percentage of offending, though such changes are limited mainly to minor property offenses or less serious forms of delinquency (Steffensmeier & Allan 1996, p. 482). **Throughout the period 1600\u20132000 women were most likely to be prosecuted for simple thefts, rather than offenses involving serious violence** (D\u2019Cruze & Jackson 2009, p. 31). **Statistical data on various regions in Europe in the early modern period show that variation in female crime rates was often linked to specific circumstances such as changing moral norms and double standards of prosecutors, as well as to economic marginality and opportunities that were related to migration, family structures, and labor participation.** The data also clearly show that **women were more likely to commit crimes in urban environments than in rural areas.**  Along the same lines, here is the perspective of social historian of crime Greg Smith (2014):  >The greater representation of males among the ranks of criminal offenders is indisputable. **The gender gap has been particularly pronounced for serious violent crimes, but it appears to have decreased somewhat over time because of relatively greater reductions in male violence over the centuries.** For other types of crimes, males also generally predominate; however, historians have been at least as interested in instances where this sex difference is trivial or nonexistent because of what it tells us about variations in the roles, status, and activity patterns of men and women. **In times and places where food and shelter were difficult to come by for some, women showed themselves as willing and able as men to do what was necessary\u2014except perhaps to kill or seriously injure\u2014to survive.**  >What these general patterns and trends obscure are the occasional departures from them in some times and places or for some types of crime. **Historians have revealed a number of these deviations, but more evidence about them could enlighten our understanding of sex differences and similarities in crime.** Furthermore, greater documentation of the extent to which officially recorded crime exaggerates or understates one or the other sexes\u2019 illegal behavior would shed more light not only on the gendered nature of crime but also on the gendered nature of responses to it. For example, **what we know about women\u2019s violence against men** (Cook 2009) **or their involvement in financial or white-collar crime** (crimes for which women were rarely convicted; Palk 2006) **could be greatly enriched by looking at sources closer to the actual behaviors.**  As noted above, scholars have observed convergences in more recent years. Lauritsen et al. (2009) and Rennison (2009) have found a narrowing of the gap in violent offending in the US, and Estrada et al. (2016, 2017) also find a similar pattern in Sweden. These trends seem to be driven by male offending decreasing more than decreases in female offending (i.e. changes in men's behavior more than women's behavior). Beatton et al. (2019) analyzed both violent and property crimes, and find a narrowing of the gender gap in offending among young people in Queensland, Australia. For some of the more popular explanations for these patterns, see Lauritsen et al.'s discussion of their results (click here).  Although further research is needed\u2122, it is clear that the sociohistorical context matters in shaping the extent to which men and women differ with respect to crime.  ---  [Continues below, with regard to research on biological differences between males and females, and a conclusion]"

For example, **what we know about women\u2019s violence against men** (Cook 2009) **or their involvement in financial or white-collar crime** (crimes for which women were rarely convicted; Palk 2006) **could be greatly enriched by looking at sources closer to the actual behaviors.**  As noted above, scholars have observed convergences in more recent years. Lauritsen et al. (2009) and Rennison (2009) have found a narrowing of the gap in violent offending in the US, and Estrada et al. (2016, 2017) also find a similar pattern in Sweden. These trends seem to be driven by male offending decreasing more than decreases in female offending (i.e. changes in men's behavior more than women's behavior). Beatton et al. (2019) analyzed both violent and property crimes, and find a narrowing of the gender gap in offending among young people in Queensland, Australia. For some of the more popular explanations for these patterns, see Lauritsen et al.'s discussion of their results (click here).  Although further research is needed\u2122, it is clear that the sociohistorical context matters in shaping the extent to which men and women differ with respect to crime.  ---  [Continues below, with regard to research on biological differences between males and females, and a conclusion]",
        "rejected_target": " I find it funny that when it comes to men, all of a sudden, the top voted comment jumps immediately to biology as an answer. It seems that only when it comes to sex differences that paint men in a bad light, genes are an acceptable answer. Then again, \"it's socialisation\" as an answer also allows for breaking down the idea of sex, so that's likely to be second. Here is an article written a while ago, that goes over some of the very large discrimination against men in terms of the justice system, and how that would impact the rates you'd see in prison. I will note that you should ignore the title, as it's just meant to be a bit provocative. I think it's fairly obvious that genes do play a role though, with high testosterone linked to more aggression which can obviously lead to more violence, and this will likely be even more true in the extremes. It's some combination of men obviously being more aggressive by nature, men still being expected to provide, and the huge gender bias in perception and thus reports, arrests, sentencing, etc."

    "\n\nHuman: The prevailing dialogue around vidoe games is that video game violence does not cause violence, but that objectification of women in media causes violence against women. This seems very suspicious to me, is this grounded in reality or is it just doublethink? I don't have any social science background whatsoever, but one of the talking points I've seen around video games is that it is dumb to relate them to violence.  Yet most of what I've heard about the portrayal of women in media is that it is a contributor to violence against women and leads people to have warped images of themselves and other women.   Is there any fundamental reason why the two are different, or why we should expect such different results?  I hope I have asked a sufficiently clear question.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Here's a study that suggests playing violent video games has a desensitizing effect on real world violence, at least in a period of time immediately after playing a violent video game. That doesn't indicate that individuals are more likely to commit violence, though, or that the desensitizing effect is long-term. The study examined 257 college students.  Here's another study from a few years later with similar findings. The study only examined 30 teenage boys, which may not adequately represent the full spectrum of individuals who play video games (all ages, both genders).  It does suggest that there are some physiological or psychological effects to video games that we don't fully understand, even if those effects are not primarily ones that incite or encourage violent behavior.  There are some studies that tie violent video games to increased aggression. Note, though, that this isn't necessarily the same thing as saying that video games incite violence. When we hear someone say \"video games cause violence or increased aggression,\" we tend to think of someone flying off the handle and shooting up a shopping mall. The effects may be far more subtle than that.  For example, \"increased aggression\" could simply mean that an individual who plays violent video games, when presented with a triggering scenario, may respond more aggressively. Example: someone accidentally bumps into you on a crowded street and causes you to step into a puddle. If video games cause increased aggression, we may see statistical differences in the way people who play them respond to this situation than people who don't play video games. They may feel more offended or angry, they may feel more like the action was deliberate, they may curse or shout more often, or otherwise be less likely to shrug it off as a harmless mistake. Those are all emotional responses that we might classify as aggressive, but don't necessarily indicate any intention to cause violence.  That doesn't mean that everyone who plays video games will respond aggressively, or that people who don't play video games *won't* respond aggressively. But if video games cause increased aggression, it may show a statistically significant increase, for example, if we find that people who play violent video games are 17% more likely to react in those ways.  Of course, that doesn't necessarily indicate causation, either. It could be that people who are naturally more aggressive are attracted to simulated violence in video games, and therefore more likely to gravitate towards those games.  Here's a study that found that men who frequently read magazines that objectify women in their content show \"lower intentions to seek sexual consent and lower intentions to adhere to decisions about sexual consent.\" \"The study also found that exposure to women\u2019s magazines was often associated with greater intentions to refuse unwanted sexual activity.\" One criticism of a study like this is that it may not indicate that these magazines cause this behavior, but that men who are dismissive of consent are more attracted to magazines that enforce their views.  We know that dehumanizing individuals often encourages violence against them. This study found that when participants associated black individuals with apes, they were more likely to note a video of a black person being beaten as justified violence. This study also found that descriptive use of words that \"connoted bestial or subhuman\" qualities in articles about death-sentence-eligible criminal defendants was correlated with juries deciding to sentence those defendants to death.  Historically, we've seen numerous other examples of dehumanizing and objectifying behavior being correlated with violence. Nazi propaganda stressed the inferiority of Jews; in Rwanda in 1994, the Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Libre des Mille Collines broadcast media labeling the Tutsi as \"cockroaches\" that should be crushed.  edit: clarity and to address issues regarding my comments on sample size"

            " Because dogs can resolve flickers at 75 Hz, which is around 50 percent faster flashing than humans can resolve, a TV screen probably appears to be rapidly flickering to dogs. This rapid flicker will make the images appear to be less real, and thus many dogs do not direct much attention to it.  (The image on a standard television screen is updated and redrawn 60 times per second. Since this is above a human's flicker resolution ability of 55 Hz, the image appears continuous and the gradually changing images give us the illusion that it is continuous. Because dogs can resolve flickers at 75 Hz, a TV screen probably appears to be rapidly flickering to dogs. This rapid flicker will make the images appear to be less real, and thus many dogs do not direct much attention to it. Even so, it is true that some dogs ignore the apparent flickering of the television and seem to respond to dogs and other interesting images on the TV screen if they are interesting enough. However, changes in technology are beginning to change the number of dogs that watch TV. High-resolution digital screens are refreshed at a much higher rate so even for dogs there is less flicker, and we are getting more reports of pet dogs who are very interested when various nature shows containing images of animals moving.)

For the past couple of weeks since we got our female cockapoo puppy, she has barely left my side. She follows me everywhere, lies on my foot during my work day, and was basically every where I went, the moment I stood up, and crying when I was in the loo etc.  Yesterday, a was putting her down on the kitchen floor (one handed, my hand under her belly) when she rolled out and fell on her side. She yelped, and her attitude towards me immediately changed. I said sorry over and over, in as gentle voice as I could, gave her a couple of treats, but since then she has been so different it's scaring me. She goes to empty rooms by herself, which has never happened before for a moment. She's stopped running completely, doesn't seem interested in the toys that she was going crazy over before, and is not eating her food in one go.  We took her to the vet yesterday evening, and she agreed that she's incredibly subdued, but physically okay. They gave her an injection in case she was sore, and this morning she was lively out of her cage for a bit (with my wife), then reverted back to walking everywhere, being alone, and not constantly scrambling at my legs like the past two weeks.  Is this just a trust issue I have to deal with, or something else?\n\nAssistant:": {

So calling your vet back to see if they would be willing to prescribe a few days of pain meds would be a good choice. That said, dogs do most of their social learning as puppies, so you should definitely work on building her bond with the family back up.

    "\n\nHuman: Vet gives ultimatum for cat diagnosed with breast cancer, but the cat is still healthy and living after 6 months Last year I adopted an adorable domestic shorthair cat. She is soon 6 years old. I found her randomly on Facebook and fell in love with her. When I picked her up, her previous owner told me that she does not know much about the cat, as she got it from someone else too and I suppose she didn't care much. Even though her previous owner did not give a flying BEEP about her and allegedly did not know if the cat is vaccinated or any of her medical history, I wanted to save her and give her a permanent home. 4 months went by and I managed to save enough money to get her to the vet and spay her. I took her to the vet and the doctor told me she will give me a call when she is done with the surgery. I leave the vet clinic and as soon as I get home I receive a call from the vet saying that they will not be able to perform the surgery because they found two cysts on the cats abdominal area. The doctor said there is a 90% chance that those would be malignant tumors and the cat has mammary cancer. Of course, I started crying as I grew very attached to the cat in the time I spent with her. The doctor then urged me to make a quick decision as the cat was still under anaesthesia, either sample the tumor to make sure it's malign, go through surgery or put her down. This was a very hard decision for me.   First of all, sampling the tumor or performing the surgery right away would have been extremely expensive and I did not have the money at the time, and second of all, I cannot just put down my cat while I am having a breakdown. I felt like my world fell apart in that moment. Quickly made an appointment at another clinic for a second opinion. I asked the doctor if I have time to start a GoFundMe to get the money as quick as possible and have surgery done and they told me that there is no time and no reason to do that because the cat was still under anaesthesia and I should decide in that moment. If I could go back in time I would tell them how unprofessional it is to make a cat parent go through such a thing. In the end, when they saw that I could not decide as they left me no choice but to put her down in that moment to not 'waste the anaesthesia', they said that there is no point to perform a surgery or sample anyway because there is a high chance that the cat will die under surgery anyway. After hearing this, I cancelled the other appointment check up I had made at the other clinic, as I saw no point in it anymore.   I want to mention that I have nothing against putting down pets, it was just the shock that made me freeze. Incapable of making a choice, I opted to wait for the cat to wake up and to take her home. I rushed back to the clinic and I met the doctor who then advised me to keep an eye out for any signs of illness, as the cat was feeling fine at the time. Doctor gave the cat one month to live... You can judge all you want but I felt it was shocking and cruel to put down a perfectly healthy and happy cat at that time.  As the weeks went by I went through a period of grieving, preparing to say my goodbyes to my sweet little kitty. Spoiled her tons, gave her the space she needed, her favourite snacks...and I waited.  I live in northern Europe where it's extremely expensive to perform surgery, before anyone tries to jump at my neck for not going through with that. Would have costed me about 3300 US Dollars for the surgery, plus an extra 1000 to see if its a malignant tumor, something that my student job would not be able to cover. The check up they did which only included shaving the hair and the anaesthesia costed me 200 US Dollars. I knew this was going to be a very expensive journey and was ready to take out a loan if I could, start a funding campaign, anything. Gave up on the thought because of the vet's advice.  It's been 6 months since then and she is still here. Still normal bowel habits, appetite of an alligator, sociable attitude, pukes once every two weeks and it's always hairballs. And I am wondering, where did me or the vet go wrong here? Is it possible the cat is indeed sick but not showing it? Was it an attempted money grab by the clinic? Could the chest lumps be something else? (I cannot feel or see them anymore as the cat's hair has completely grown back)  TLDR: 6 year old female domestic shorthair cat got diagnosed with mammal cancer, vet did not give her long to live but she is still alive and thriving after 6 months.\n\nAssistant:": {

Lastly, I know the internet makes you feel that almost 6 billion out of 7 billion population is introverted but that is not the case and even I as an introvert would not like to stop other people from enjoying things just because the current situation suits me.

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: The campaign by republicans to denounce the US presidential election as \u201cstolen\u201d is harmful to the integrity of democracy. Ironically, I think Mitch McConnell said it best when he said that rejecting the results of the US presidential election \u201cwould send democracy into a death spiral.\u201d   It\u2019s been almost 8 months now since Biden was declared the winner and I still will see republicans talking about the stolen election, fraudulent ballots, and how Trump should still be president. To date, there has been no SIGNIFICANT evidence of voter fraud. I say significant because there has been a few instances of minor ballot tampering (minor meaning not enough to change anything about the election). I have yet to see any real, justifiable evidence of something that would impact the election results. Every court has rejected appeals to dismiss ballots.  I believe people are out of touch with reality if they really believe the election was stolen. Too much right-wing news propaganda is being fed to people to think there actually is evidence of voter fraud. It hurts our democracy when it\u2019s citizens do not believe in the integrity of elections. I believe the events on Jan 6 are also a direct result of this campaign and ignorance. People should accept the results, even if they don\u2019t like it, and hope the president does a great job for the benefit of the country.   Finally, I\u2019m gonna add that if there ever is any significant voter fraud, it should be investigated to the highest extent and by a non-biased committee.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: The notion of banning the \"N-word\" under all circumstances from people who are not black is ridiculous and childish. Let me start off by saying that this is not me advocating for people who are not black to be able to say the word with the same levels of liberty as black people (I'll explain why later). Also I must state that I am a person who is a visible minority living in the western world. (I feel like people would immediately dismiss this argument if I was white)  Also for the most part I'm talking about the word ending with an \"a\" not an \"er\" however the same principles apply.  Essentially, banning *anything* completely and punishing people without consideration of context and intention is foolish. (Maybe besides rape because I can't think of a single competent reason why someone would have to rape another person). This includes physical violence and murder. For most instances its safe to say those are wrong, however under certain circumstances, such as self defense, I do not think it's wrong for one to use physical violence and if the situation calls for it, perhaps even murder.   This is true especially for words. Now I understand, if a white person, or any non-black person chose to use the \"N-word\" to address or refer to a black individual over a race neutral word, it *would* be weird. Why would they use the \"N-word\" specifically? Do you want to \"other\" yourself from them? Do you feel ashamed to imply a similarity between you and them? It would be equivalent to a person who addresses back people with \"Hello black guy!\" But when they address people of other ethnic backgrounds they'll use \"Hey man,\" or \"What's up bro?\" There's clearly a mischievous reason for why they would address the black person differently.  However, when it comes to scenerios where the word holds no demeaning or degrading intent at all, such as reading a quote, or a book, or singing a song, there's no reason for punishing the person who said it. Even if the quote/book/lyric was demeaning, it doesn't mean the person who recites it holds those views.  It seems that people who take offense to the \"N-word\" under those circumstances are acting on pure insecurity. The thing is, I would feel the same way. If people used a racial slur towards my race, even when they're singing a song or reading a quote, I'd also feel a little off put. But I know they mean no harm and that I'm only put off due to pure insecurity, and we shouldn't make any decisions based off protecting people from feeling insecure. That's a quick road to hell. Feeling offended is fine, we are able to feel that way for a reason. Feeling offended due to your insecurity is less fine, but still understable. Acting on your offended feelings which stems from insecurity is no longer fine.  Currently, there are certain words that are fine to use that describe people of a certain group. \"Gay\" for homosexuals or \"special\" for mentally challenged children. Whats stopping someone in the future from saying \"the word gay offends me, no one should use it anymore\" despite the fact that it was not meant to be offensive at all. I believe people should at least get to a point where they could hear a word used with no intention to demean and be able to brush it off.  The argument then becomes \"the 'n-word' is inherently demeaning.\" This is more so for \"er\" and not \"a\" since \"a\" is used as a term of endearment for the most part. But YES, it is inherently offensive. Thats why if one is going to use it, they better have a damn good reason for it, but banning it completely seems almost childish. It has an attitude of \"if i dont see it, hear it, or think of it, it doesn't exist.\"   All in all, I can sympathize with the notion that simply hearing the \"N-word\" can make one feel offended. I can feel it too if someone were to use a slur directed at my ethnicity, even with no intent of demeaning me. However, I still don't think that's a valid reason to ban the word completely and scrutinize anyone who says it in a non-demeaning way. I think the current culture of banning the word allows us to accept the notion that \"it's okay to make decisions out of protecting people from feeling insecure\" which is a quick road to hell. It's much better to make oneself strong enough to overcome insecurity than to try and protect oneself from ever feeling insecure. But if someone does use the \"n-word\" for a stupid reason such as to demean someone, they deserve the hate they get.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: Cultural Appropriation isn't a bad thing So first of all, I want to be clear in saying that as a society, we should be respectful and embracing of the cultures and traditions of other societies. Diversity and societal differences should be celebrated, not denigrated.  However, with that in mind, I believe that- in America specifically, with its history of being a \"melting pot\" country- we should not view cultural appropriation in a negative context.   There are a few reasons for this. The first and most pressing to me is that \"cultural appropriation,\" as I understand it, is just the blending of culture- one person likes a certain aspect of a different culture and incorporates it into their own. This trend is replicated across multiple cultures, with multiple people, leading to a blended society. This then, in turn, leads to a very diverse and multicultural society that embraces the cultures and backgrounds of others... right?  Another is that I think the most common examples of cultural appropriation often lead to higher exposure to the aspect of the culture that is being \"appropriated.\" For example, Elvis enjoys gospel/r&b and wants to incorporate it into his music, so he throws electric guitars and hip gyration on it and boom- rock and roll. Black culture is in the mainstream.   Obviously in this specific instance, this was a pre-civil rights era America, and the aspects of black culture that Elvis incorporated were never explained to have originated in black culture. But had this occurred in a vacuum, with societal conditions at the time notwithstanding, I think you could make an argument that Elvis highlighted, rather than appropriated, black culture, leading to further exposure.   So am I way off base? Do I just not understand cultural appropriation as a concept? CMV.\n\nAssistant:": {

Just look at the Kimono Wednesday controversy at the MFA (https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2015/07/18/counter-protesters-join-kimono-fray-mfa/ZgVWiT3yIZSlQgxCghAOFM/story.html) where Asian-American and white women protested letting people try on kimonos.  The Deputy Consul General of Japan in Boston's comment was, \u201cWe actually do not quite understand what their point of protest is. We tried to listen to those people who are protesting, but we think together with the MFA we should encourage that Japanese culture be appreciated in a positive way.\u201d  Japanese people don't care who wears kimonos, because if you are actually Japanese and live in Japan, your connection with your culture is so encompassing and multi-faceted that the idea that kimonos actually represent anything about you is laughable, any more than we would consider blue jeans to represent America.

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: Increasing gun control (e.g. banning assault rifles) will not significantly (if at all) reduce the amount or severity of mass shooting rampages. This is not a belief I hold because I'm a conservative or libertarian or Republican or whatever (I don't like labels, anyway). I live in Canada, and don't own a gun, so I have no personal interest in this. This is something that occured to me when, in the wake of the recent Oregon shooting, I was researching various mass shootings, noticed something interesting. Especially after the Sandy Hook shooting (for which an assault rifle was used), the conversation was not only that of mental health (which is great and all), but even more so a practical discussion for gun control. Specifically, many talked of banning civilian semi-automatic assault rifles and \"high-capacity\" 30-round magazines. It makes sense, but here's what caught my eye:  The deadliest mass shooting of all time was the 2011 attack committed by Anders Breivik in Norway, on the island of Ut\u00f8ya. In the span of one hour, he managed to kill 69 people and wound 110, 55 of them seriously. This was all done with a .223 Ruger Mini-14 semi-automatic carbine and the 9mm Glock 34 semi-automatic pistol.  Similarly, the deadliest shooting in America was the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, during which Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people and wounded 17 more. This was all done with just two pistols: the 9mm Glock 19 and the .22LR Walther P22. Note that the .22LR round is tiny compared to the 9mm round, and so a .22 caliber *pistol* would probably be the last gun banned if we were to ban all guns.  Columbine High School, 1999. 13 killed, 21 wounded. 9mm TEC-9 semi-automatic pistol, 9mm Hi-Point 995 Carbine, Savage 67H pump-action shotgun, and the Stevens 311D double barreled sawed-off shotgun.  The biggest takeaway is probably the Virginia Tech shooting. It's remarkably deadly considering its humble arsenal. It seems that the type of weapon used has little effect on the outcome of the shooting, with circumstance and police response being more important factors. I mean, if people planning to shoot up a school want guns, they'll get them, legally or not. Even a complete ban of all guns for civilians would do little to curb the black market for guns considering their pervasive use in law enforcement and military alike.  I'd appreciate it if someone were to show me some facts and statistics to prove me wrong with regards to the effect of gun laws on mass shootings and gun violence in general.

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: Humans are wholly unprepared for an actual first contact with an extraterrestrial species. I am of the opinion that pop culture, media, and anthropomorphization has influenced humanity into thinking that aliens will be or have;  * Structurally similar, such as having limbs, a face, or even a brain.   * Able to be communicated with, assuming they have a language or even communicate with sound at all.   * Assumed to be either good or evil; they may not have a moral bearing or even understanding of ethics.   * Technologically advanced, assuming that they reached space travel via the same path we followed.   I feel that looking at aliens through this lens will potentially damage or shock us if or when we encounter actual extraterrestrial beings.   Prescribing to my view also means that although I believe in the potential of extraterrestrial existence, any \"evidence\" presented so far is not true or rings hollow in the face of the universe.   * UFO's assume that extraterrestrials need vehicles to travel through space.   * \"Little green men\" and other stories such as abductions imply aliens with similar body setups, such as two eyes, a mouth, two arms, two legs. The chances of life elsewhere is slim; now they even look like us too?   * Urban legends like Area 51 imply that we have taken completely alien technology and somehow incorporated into a human design.   Overall I just think that should we ever face this event, it will be something that will be filled with shock, horror, and a failure to understand. To assume we could communicate is built on so many other assumptions that it feels like misguided optimism.   I'm sure one might allude to cosmic horrors, etc. Things that are so incomprehensible that it destroys a humans' mind. I'd say the most likely thing is a mix of the aliens from \"Arrival\" and cosmic horrors, but even then we are still putting human connotations all over it.   Of course, this is not humanity's fault. All we have to reference is our own world, which we evolved on and for. To assume a seperate \"thing\" followed the same evolutionary path or even to assume evolution is a universally shared phenomenon puts us in a scenario where one day, if we meet actual aliens, we won't understand it all.\n\nAssistant:": {

Or somehow the air or water in which they evolved just doesn't carry sound? If sound can be carried in the air and/or water of an aliens home-world you could almost guaruntee they would evolve hearing and sound-based communication, some kind of language. This is another thing that has evolved countless different times and exists at different levels in the animal world. We have ultra-complex spoken language. A dog can communicate with body language and barks. Monkeys scream at each other all day. Lions and Tigers roar into the night to establish and maintain territorial boundaries. Whales and dolphins sing to each other. Aliens might have some crazy language like that but like those it would be sound-based.  Its possible aliens could \"evolve beyond\" the need for spoken language. At basic level that doesn't work unless the whole species somehow invents communication a new (technological) way and they all communicate that way and never communicate the old way. Like its possible maybe after thousands of years of space travel and shit that there could be a race, sub-race or like in Dune, just a group of deformed individuals who have merged with their tech.

            " I'm not sure it's even possible to really be fully prepared for something like first contact, at least for every possible variation.  If aliens show up and end up being truly unfathomable.. well then there isn't really any point in trying to prepare for that.  So we prepare for first contact in instances in which preparation is actually useful.  If SETI makes first contact, well that would indicate the aliens have some basic understanding of math/science, meaning we have some sort of common ground to build off of there.  If they suddenly show up to earth via some far-reaching technology we don't understand, well they are either here to interact with us or not.  If they don't want to interact with us, well preparation for that isn't going to do much good.  If they do want to interact, well we have the ability to analyze and recognize patterns in data we collect, we wouldn't have to rely on some linguist trying to speak to them (that also assumes that aliens sophisticated enough to do the heavy lifting in getting here would rely on US to do the heavy lifting once it comes to everything else).  I'm sure there would be many people terrified, jumping to religion or off bridges, but we also have plenty of nerds who I'm sure would be dedicated enough to put aside cosmic horror and work on the issue. I guess my point is, as you point out there are many possibilities of what first contact could be like, however I don't think we can/should prepare for every possibility, rather we should focus on scenarios in which we could have the most impact, and while we could improve, we aren't wholly unprepared.  Also regarding pop culture, I don't think that what does well in theaters really translates to what humans expect from reality.  I'm sure some people think they could do a backflip off an exploding helicopter into a moving car, but most people realize that's just action movie fluff.",
            " Ok, I'm super excited. I love this topic. Sorry for the length, TLDR at the end.  First contact with any extraterrestrial species and first contact with an intelligent extraterrestrial species are two completely different things. Most likely our first contact will be with extraterrestrial bacteria or other microscopic form of life. However, you seem to be talking about an intelligent species, so we will start there.  As you have stated, we only have our planets species to draw information from. There are some 9 million species of animals on our planet, so we have a decent sample size to draw from, but they all followed the same evolutionary tree. Lets run through your arguments on at a time:  Structurally similar:  Limbs of some sort are almost certainly going to be present. An intelligent species would have evolved to use tools of some sort and logically that will require limbs to grasp and manipulate those tools.  A face and brain are also evolutionarily a given with our current understanding. Almost all animals have a brain and nervous system with exception of things like the sea sponge, but they are filter feeders and don't display any signs of intelligence. A face kind of depends on your definition, but logically an intelligent species capable of traveling through space was most likely evolved from a predator species and not a prey species. At least in our evolutionary history, predators have forward facing stereo vision, to better gauge distance to prey, with the opening of their GI tract (mouth) within close distance to their eyes. A nose or other opening to breath with while the mouth is full of prey also allows the predator to not suffocate while they are waiting for the prey to die.  Without language of some sort, transfer of knowledge from one generation to the next would be almost impossible. You may be correct that they may not communicate verbally, but communication is present in all species on our planet, even ones we don't consider intelligent. Whether you realize it or not, you use non-verbal communication every day. This is how we can tell if someone is sad or angry just by looking at them. Written communication is different, and we only have one species on our planet that has developed written communication, but it was huge in terms of being able to advance our civilization.  Good vs Evil (ethics) - Super grey area. Good vs Evil has changed so many times during our short history that this may be hard to argue one way or the other. People that we see as evil today most likely did not see themselves as evil. So instead of getting into the theological discussion of what is good vs evil or what is ethical vs not, lets define this as being able to recognize harm caused by actions taken, or empathy. I would argue that empathy would almost be certain in any intelligent species because of the need to communicate. We can look at our planet and see almost every species display some sort of empathy to other creatures.  Whether this intelligent species reached space travel by starting with chemical rockets or not is almost a moot point. Any species that is capable of intentionally guided interstellar travel will by definition have more advance technology than us as we are not capable of that kind of interstellar travel yet.  On to the \"Evidence\":  Extraterrestrial UFOs have probably not been captured by any government. It is too statistically improbable that aliens visited earth and the government was able to find and hide all of the evidence. But to your point - How else would an alien species travel through space without a vehicle?  Little green men and stories of abduction are most likely sleep paralysis stories and I don't know of anyone ever producing concrete evidence of an abduction. But, given the number of extrasolar planets we have found so far, current estimates say there are at least 100 billion planets in the Milky Way alone. And there are 200+ billion galaxies in the observable universe which puts the number of potential exoplanets at 2\\*10\\^21. So chances for life elsewhere, even if rare, is astronomical. And on top of that, given our understanding of evolution, yes they may look humanoid.  Area 51. Well, I agree with you. Area 51 is probably used for studying advanced (human) technologies that we developed or another captured from another country.  Assuming that we wouldn't be able to find a way to communicate with an alien intelligent species really underestimates humans desire to understand and learn. I think we would have a lot of people and governments that would like to shoot first and ask questions later. Let's be honest, look at all of the fights and wars and hate that humans have caused over the years just because someone's religion, skin color, country, city, school, economic status, etc is different from theirs.  I don't understand what you mean by \"even to assume evolution is a universally shared phenomenon\". Given our current understanding of organisms and evolution, all life would have started as a protein soup as it were. Followed by single celled and then multi-celled organisms and eventually intelligent beings.  I think humans are ready to acknowledge an extraterrestrial species, but from a distance at first. Agent K said it right \"A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky dangerous animals and you know it. Fifteen hundred years ago everybody knew the Earth was the center of the universe. Five hundred years ago, everybody knew the Earth was flat, and fifteen minutes ago, you knew that humans were alone on this planet.

            " I think your view of pop culture and media is somewhat limited by your geographical location. A few years ago, a Chinese Scifi novel called the three body problem (first book in the \u2018\"Remembrance of Earth's Past \u201c trilogy)  became very popular when it became the first Chinese novel to receive a Hugo award. The aliens featured in that novel is more or less the antithesis of what you described: their appearance and physiology was never explicitly described, but implied to be vastly different from the human's, they have no understanding of morality and ethics, doesn't communicate via sound waves etc. As a result of the books' popularity, this view of aliens is now arguably the mainstream assumption of aliens in China.   It's a pretty good book, you should give it a read if you're interested.",

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: Typing is better than handwriting My pet peeve is teachers who only accept handwritten work. Here are the reasons why typing notes, fiction, etc on a computer is superior to traditional paper and pen/pencil:  1: Typing is more environmentally friendly, you're not wasting paper  2: Typing is faster. Much, much, much faster. You waste less time, and if taking notes, you can get down much more info.  3: It is far, far easier to edit and revise  4: Your hand doesn't hurt.  5: Typing is standardized, which means it is more legible and also removes the bias some people have against people with bad handwriting.  6: Computer files are much harder to lose, especially if you back them up. They also don't fade over time or get smudged.  Finally, to preemptively take out the \"handwriting aids in retention\" argument, the sheer speed of typing allows one to more accurately transcribe new information with great speed, leaving more time to review.  Note that this only applies to the written word. Clearly, using paper and writing utensils may be preferable if you are painting or drawing or doing some fancy calligraphy.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " I can think of several reasons why a teacher might want to require this.   1. Teaching handwriting. This is a physical skill that requires practice and the development of muscle memory. So it makes sense to assign handwritten work, especially for younger students.   2. Equity. Not all students have regular or easy access to a computer. Requiring that assignments be handwritten levels the playing field.  3. Anti-cheating. For in-person assignments or exams where you aren\u2019t allowed outside resources, requiring that things be handwritten is the easiest way to ensure that no cheating takes place.",

But that misses the point of taking good notes.  Personally, I type everything *except* my notes.  Good notes do function as a store of knowledge, but their primary function is to help learn the material *while you're taking the notes*.  Taking good notes - which means *not* transcribing all the information - requires you to rapidly summarize and pick out key details, so you're forced to process the information on the fly.  I almost never return to my notes, but I take them anyway to help learn.  In general, effective reviewing is about quality, not quantity.",

Shouldn't we be discouraging unhealthy behavior by encouraging others to live a healthier, more active lifestyle?  I've honestly never understood why ridiculing someone's poor life choices is considered a bad thing. The same goes for people who are anorexic, bulimic, etc. Why is it considered a good thing to encourage people to basically slowly kill themselves instead of make them confront their problems head on?  And I get it, the media is always depicting people that 99% of the population will never be able to look like. That's not what I'm going after. It just seems like that if someone calls a morbidly obese person \"gross and disgusting,\" suddenly that person is an asshole. But is that person not correct? Being fat *is* gross and disgusting. It's not like someone is saying \"all black people are disgusting criminals,\" because that statement that would be racist and entirely untrue. So why are people who tell the truth by calling out fat people for living shitty lives considered to be on the same level as racists?   I mean like, if you get that offended over someone telling you the truth, why not just lose weight instead of complaining? It's really not that hard to lose weight.

            " Rolling blackouts become necessary when there is far more demand than supply of electric power.  In developed countries with stable and reliable grids they are rare, but in places where the infrastructure is not really fit for purpose you may end up in situations where there is more demand for electricity than you can supply with the power plants you have.  Normally you have vast interconnected power grids where these things can be even out across many different countries and also have power plants that stand by and can be brought online to make up for the shortfall.  In some cases such as isolated power grids on islands, places with poorly maintained infrastructure and developing countries you may find yourself in a situation where there simply is not more power to be had.  If the operators in this case the operators have a choice. If they do nothing, physics happen, the frequency of the electricity on the grid goes down and either breaks a lot of stuff or causes things to automatically shut down to prevent being broken. This would mean no electricity for anyone for a long time.  The other choice is to cut of some customers until the remaining demand matches what you can supply. Critical infrastructure like hospitals etc and things necessary to keep the grid itself running are not going to be cut of.  You could either pick a neighborhood to have no power for a day or you can pick 24 neighborhoods to have no power for an hour each one after the other to lessen the misery by spreading it around.  That is a rolling blackout. The are that gets blacked out rolls around and affects most people for a short time.  It is not good but better then the alternative.

            " Rolling blackouts happen when the energy demands on the grid cannot be sustained by the grid production. So, a small portion of the grid shuts off to reduce overall demand. They represent a LOSS of money by energy companies, not a net gain. This is because there is demand they are not fulfilling, meaning they are losing sales.  Balencing a grid is very difficult, because production needs to exactly equal demand as much as possible. You don't want to waste money producing excess electricity, but you also want to meet the demand levels. This Balencing act is very complicated, and places many demands on the grid (such as peak demand plants that are only intended to operate during times of the highest levels of consumption).",

Electricity is billed based on the amount you use, and if you can't use it (because there's no power), then the power company doesn't make money.  A rolling blackout happens when the power company can't provide enough power to everyone that wants it, so some people don't get it. The power company realizes that people and businesses need electricity, so they shut off one group for a while, then another group, so everyone gets a turn with some electricity.",

            " The trick is that our bodies are saving that energy in case of an emergency. Think of it like carrying a backpack full of canned food. It's kind of heavy carrying that backpack around, but if there's ever an emergency, you could reach into the backpack and open up a can of beans. The trick is that you're not going to do that unless it's a real emergency.  On some level, our bodies are still kind of expecting us to be like cavemen, worried about getting enough food to survive an ice age. So unless we work really hard, our bodies will try to keep the fat as they don't think it's a big enough emergency to use it yet.  So, if you want to lose weight, you need to change your eating habits so that you are eating less. Then, your body will go well I guess I need to use little bit of the emergency reserves because we don't have enough food to eat.",
            " Fat is an extremely effective form of energy storage. It's hard to get rid of because it stores sooo much energy. You'd have to completely stop eating for a day or two to burn off a pound of fat. The common number is a pound of fat is 3500-4000 calories, but that's complicated.   If you want to do the excercise route, you'd have to walk a mile to burn 100 calories (running doesn't burn a whole lot more, but you get it done faster :P ). For comparison, that's half a Snickers bar.  Edit: to add to this a bit, there's very good reason to excercise beyond short term calorie burning. There's health benefits beyond just calorie usage.  Edit 2: electric boogaloo: since people keep bringing this up, running burns maybe 50% more than walking depending on what speeds you categorize as running and walking. This is *per mile*. If you run twice as fast as you walk, you're at least doubling your calories burned per hour.",
            " >Shouldn't it be easy to deplete your fat since its an energy storage? I get so confused because people say for weight loss its actually all about diet not exercise. Wouldn't you want to basically just consistently exercise and deplete your energy (fat storage)?      Excess fat is, in concept, extremely trivial to get rid of. As you hinted, you'd simply have to consume less energy than you're using (exercising isn't even required) and your reserves would get depleted over time.      Eating is *fun* however, and habits are hard to change. That's why dieting is tough - it's a ludicrously simple plan that is hard to execute.",

            " Exercising doesn't burn as many calories are many people think. It's more effective to limit your caloric intake so that your body will slowly use your energy reserves (fat) this is for a few reasons.   First, it's not healthy to drop a lot of weight very fast. It can really be an issue to lose more than a few pounds a week. Such weight loss would be best done with medical support.   Secondly, you should exercise in combination with changing your eating habits but excessive exercise will likely hurt you. When exercising you need rest days and recovery time. Mild to moderate exercise in combination with life style changes is the best ways to try and lose weight in a healthy way.   Many people have the issue that their lifestyle is difficult to change due to work or economic demands that cannot easily be changed.",

            " Recently, I was diagnosed with diabetes type 2- insulin resistance- and learned a very interesting thing about how the body stores and uses fat. Specifically in regards to blood sugar.   Basically, your body prioritizes using the blood sugar already in your blood before it uses the body's stored fat. In unmanaged Dt2, one's blood sugar is always high. That sugar is used first, while a great deal of it is stored as fat, because that's what your body does in the presence of elevated blood sugar.   In order to use the stored fat, you have to lower your body's blood sugar level. It has to dip below a certain point before your body begins taking and breaking down stored fat back into blood sugar.   Several problems immediately emerge.  1. The western diet eats 3 times a day, constantly supplying blood sugar into a system overloaded with it. It never breaks down fat because it never needs to: there is *always* a faster, easier supply of blood sugar at hand.   2. Crazy stupid levels of carbohydrates  are everywhere. It's not as simple as just 'avoiding sweets' as I used to believe, Its *all* carbohydrates. Potatoes. Pasta. Bread. Apple juice. Get any carb meter (theres an app for that) and track carbs. Most people have no idea how many grams of carbohydrates they are eating, or what their blood sugar levels actually are. Its is crazy stupid hard to discover, balance and control the amount of carbs in ones diet, most processed foods have added carbs to boost flavor. It impossible to stumble into being on a low carb diet- carb control requires a knowlegable and concerted effort, and most people never bother. Why would you? We're told to count calories, not carbs.   3. Cardio is a pain in the ass. My entire life is spent making things easier for me, not harder. Save energy all day just to burn it for no reason at all? What the fuck is that? But it works. Cardio is king. Cardio, along with any intense exercise, *burns blood sugar*. Fast. Like, really really fast. It's so good at burning sugar it's an emergency control for my diabetic ass should things get too out of whack. It's also why cardio is a key part of any weight loss program.    Cardio isnt just for burning calories- in fact, as far as calorie burners go, it doesn't burn very many. But the fuel for cardio comes from the existing blood sugar first, burning away that energy buffer, and lowering blood sugar enough to start using stored energy. Cardio itself doesnt burn off a lot of fat- the vast majority of your calories are burned just being alive- but it sets up the body for success in terms of using stored fat. The same is true for an 'active' lifestyle. Short bursts (20-45mins) of intense activity thought the day burn off extant blood sugar and encourage the use of bodyfat stores.   When you look at the obesity epidemic through a carb-control lense, there are a lot of factors that instantly stand out. From that perspective in regards to weight loss, a tremendous number of people have been 'set up to fail' their entire lives, and never even know it. Probably never will. Its entrenched.

You'd have to completely stop eating for a day or two to burn off a pound of fat. The common number is a pound of fat is 3500-4000 calories, but that's complicated.   If you want to do the excercise route, you'd have to walk a mile to burn 100 calories (running doesn't burn a whole lot more, but you get it done faster :P ). For comparison, that's half a Snickers bar.  Edit: to add to this a bit, there's very good reason to excercise beyond short term calorie burning. There's health benefits beyond just calorie usage.  Edit 2: electric boogaloo: since people keep bringing this up, running burns maybe 50% more than walking depending on what speeds you categorize as running and walking. This is *per mile*. If you run twice as fast as you walk, you're at least doubling your calories burned per hour.",

            " Phone cameras in the last few years have improved immensely to handle low light and movement. However, they use software to compensate and correct for their limitations when they are physically limited by (1) lens size - which allows the amount of light through, (2) sensor size - which limits the light detected - so low light conditions are worse and (3) zoom - most phone have 3 lenses - wide (0.5x), normal (1x) and zoom (2x to 3x).  The software will compensate for zoom (usually digital zoom for anything greater than5x) which can be seen in the grain and noise of zoomed images, long exposure shots impose multiple images and taking the average of the images.  The comparison with DSLR may soon be obsolete with mirrorless cameras. They remove the \"SLR\" component which makes them (1) take more frames per second (5 to 20 fps), (2) quicker to focus and (3) more intelligent to monitor the photographer's eye to locate where the subject is located.  The one area in which phones cannot beat cameras is lenses. A 5mm lens on a camera compared to a 72mm lens on a DSLR camera is a difference of 200x the area for light to go through. That is a huge difference.  Having said all of that, know the limitations of the camera on your phone or DSLR and use it wisely! :)"

    "\n\nHuman: Wife moved out while I was work, won't let me see my son now. Hi, new to reddit. Need advice on what do to please..  &#x200B;  My wife and I haven't been getting along for awhile. I work nights and came home Saturday morning to a house with only my bed and sectional. My wife while I was at work moved out and took everything. I called her and she came over later that day and agreed to move back in if we went to marriage counseling. Went back to work that night expecting to come home and her and my son to be moved back in. Well i'm assuming with the influence of her family, they talked her out of it because she decided not to move back in and is now refusing to come to the house. Now she is pretty much refusing me to let me see my son. She doesn't respond to my text and when I call her she only wants to meet at a park after work so I can see my son for like 20 min. She refusing to let me take him for several hours, ect. I thought about picking him up from daycare but she took my key to get into the daycare. Also her mother works at the daycare and may refuse to let me take him.   &#x200B;  My question is what is my legal right to see my son and pick him up from day care if I want to spend time with him while she is at work. And what is my legal right to all the stuff she took from my house?  Also I live in Illinois.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: A fling from 7 months ago just told me she was pregnant, she just found out, says she needs my signature for adoption. Throwaway account because\u2026well, I\u2019m terrified and embarrassed by all of this. Probably going to cross post this, because I really need some advice.   I (29M) had a fling (28F) from 7 months ago, and she just told me that she was pregnant and that the baby is mine. She found out sometime last month, so somewhere around the 6-7 month mark she discovered that she was pregnant. Her due date is at the beginning of March.  I slept with this girl twice, around late May/early June. She told me she had an IUD, and I used condoms. She lives in Oklahoma, and I moved away in the summer to Kentucky.   So basically, I got a text two days ago from her that said we needed to talk. She told me she was pregnant with my child. I tried calling her, but she refuses to talk on the phone, only text. She originally said that she didn't want anything from me, just wanted me to know.   I started questioning paternity and the timeline\u2013how can she just now be discovering she\u2019s pregnant? Hasn\u2019t she had her period? How does she know I\u2019m the father? Can I speak with her doctor? Can I see a sonogram of the baby?   She says that she has bled since we had sex, but that her periods were always light and irregular. So she never suspected anything. She isn\u2019t really showing, but may be growing now, idk. She still lives with her parents and they supposedly still don\u2019t know.   She says I\u2019m the only person she has slept with all year\u2013which may be true, but I know she\u2019s gone on dates since (she was really obsessive and weird, part of the reason I ended things, and after I ended things and moved, she would send me snapchats of her texts/ her on a date with a guy). She is denying my request for a paternity test until after the baby is born.  She says that the doctor won\u2019t speak to me. Idk how she knows this since I just requested it, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that were true. And she has not sent me any ultrasound proof, despite my numerous askings.   I just signed a one year contract with a company, so my life is pretty much locked in for the next 12 months, at least as far as physically moving goes. My work is sending me to Dallas in January, and I have offered to drive to her and Oklahoma to talk and figure out logistics, but she is refusing to acknowledge my offer/ request to meet.  After texting back and forth, she started telling me that she needs my signature to put the baby up for adoption. I told her to send me the paperwork so that I can read over it, but that I don\u2019t want to sign anything until I can prove paternity. Additionally, I want to be involved in the adoption process\u2013but pending paternity results, I want to be prepared to take in the child and raise it myself. I think it's unfair that she has just now informed me about this and I have 2 months to prepare to raise a child that may or may not be mine. I think adoption is great, and there are a lot of parents that would benefit from an adopted child, but I don\u2019t want to burden the system and would like to be a father, even if I have to be a single dad (I\u2019ve told my girlfriend about this situation, and she has been very supportive and is requesting that I steer clear of adoption and raise the child myself. Mostly because she has a half brother that she has never met from her dad\u2019s similar experience, and her dad never tried to be a part of the kids life after adoption, so she doesn\u2019t know who her half brother is\u2026 and it really frustrates her). I\u2019m not sure what Oklahoma laws are for adoption, so any insight would be helpful.   She works in radiology, and has told me she has done a lot of procedures, such as portable CT scans in the OR this summer and fall. She is worried about the health of the baby due to the amount of radiation it may have been exposed to while she was pregnant and working. She says she doesn\u2019t want to do a paternity test before the baby is born because it could affect the health of the baby.   The whole idea of leaving me in the dark about paternity is really frustrating. Her and I slept together twice, both with protection. As a timeline of our relationship\u2013we met on tinder and hooked up. The next day, I got a call from my family saying that my mom was severely injured while on vacation in New Mexico, and I was the closest member of the family, distance-wise, to her. I dropped everything and left the following morning to drive to NM. I have a cat, and I really needed someone to watch my cat while I was gone. After some rapid texts, none of my friends were pulling through. As a last ditch effort, I texted the girl I had just met on tinder and asked if she could cat sit. She said she could, but it would have to be at my apartment. So I gave my keys to a pretty much random person and left in a rush to New Mexico for two weeks, until my mom was stable enough to travel home. I realized this girl was really weird while I was gone, because she didn\u2019t just drop by to feed my cat and leave, she hung out at my apartment for literal hours. When I got home, it was obvious she had snooped through pretty much everything I owned and had read my journals. We had sex one more time when I got back, mostly as a way to keep things cool and  say thanks, but I was already on the outs with her, was planning to, and was forward about my intentions to move back home to take care of my mom. The second time we had sex she held me in as I said I was going to come. I was wearing a condom so I didn\u2019t think much of it, but I noticed after we had sex and I went to the bathroom that she laid on her back and raised her knees up. I have no way of knowing if she tampered with the condoms that were in my bedside drawer for the two weeks I was gone and she was house/ cat sitting. I saw a lot of red flags in her, so I was happy to end things and move away. When I left, she wrote me a huuuuge handwritten letter, and hid it in my suitcase for me to discover as I unpacked, about how she wants to marry me and how I\u2019m her person and how she wants to spend the rest of our lives together, no matter what it takes. I mean, fuck, we only hungout like a grand total of 4 days.   I don\u2019t generally post to social media, but I recently made my first instagram post in like 2 years. It was about my current girlfriend and I\u2019s relationship, a bunch of pictures of us together, and a caption talking about how grateful I am to be dating someone like her. The following morning I got the text from the girl with the news that I may be a father. Merry Christmas, I guess?  Tl;dr  Girl I may have knocked up is refusing paternity test to prove I\u2019m the father, at least until after the baby is born. She lives in Oklahoma and I used to live in OK. She says she needs my signature to sign away the baby for adoption. I may want to keep the child, if they are mine. I don\u2019t trust her, tbh. She is refusing to provide any proof to the existence of her pregnancy. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being manipulated or if I\u2019m going to need to make a large amount of life moves to try and take care of a child, or if I need to consider adoption more seriously.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " So a couple of things .... First, prenatal paternity tests don't really pose a risk to the baby anymore. They can be done by taking a simple blood sample from the pregnant woman. It can be done at the same time as other prenatal blood tests, so it doesn't even really require an \"extra\" needle stick to her. (It used to be done only through amniocentesis, which is a fairly major procedure where the physician puts a long needle through the pregnant woman's abdomen and collects some amniotic fluid. That procedure could cause a miscarriage in some instances.)  Second, her argument about being concerned due to possible exposure to xrays doesn't make a lot of sense. People who work in radiology wear lead aprons to protect themselves from undesired exposure to radiation. It is possible that she isn't wearing hers, but that would almost definitely violate her employer's policy. Occupational radiation exposure is a cancer risk, so a concern for everyone not just pregnant people. It is a big deal for those who take xrays/are near xrays when they are taken/have potential exposure there.   Both of those comments sound like they are just excuses to avoid giving you what you want so she can continue to string you along.",

    "\n\nHuman: (CA) Neighbor moved my trash can so it wasn't emptied, frequently tresspasses on my property claiming she has an easement, and now sent my landlord claiming she is going to sue. **Intro --** I have a troublesome neighbor who I know I have done nothing wrong to. I live at 4311, she lives immediately to the east of me at 4307, and my landlord lives immediately to the west of me at 4315. I am literally in the middle of a neighbor war.  **Context --** A few weeks back, my neighbor at 4307 who I will call Jane was caught moving my trashcan so it would not be emptied by my neighbor from down the street. She denies it ever happened. She moved it because it was in her handicap parking space on the road in our neighborhood. On the north side of the road where her car is parked is clearly indicated as a 'no parking zone' due to the road's narrow width. Even if it was a parking zone, it's not indicated as being a parking space by paint, or signage as required by ADA compliance.  I went to our city manager asking for clarification if I am placing my garbage can in an incorrect location. She stated that she should not be parking there, and will have code enforcement cite her for doing so. As a result she is now parking in the alley and walking on my property to get inside her home even though she can walk through her own property to get inside it. I have sent her a few messages on facebook asking her to not use my property as a thoroughfare and she wrote back saying she has an easement to the property which my landlord and I have both failed to find any evidence of either verbal or written.   **The Letter --** I got a call from my landlord stating that she sent a letter from an attorney claiming she will sue if we do not comply with things. I have reasons to believe that most, if not the entire letter was written by her due to some peculiar details. Click to view.  Just looking for advice on what I should do to remain out of litigation, and keep her from moving my garbage can, and keep her off my property.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: [NY] Nieces (17 and 14) ran away from mom\u2019s home to live with dad due to mom\u2019s \u201ccreepy\u201d boyfriend. Can we keep girls against their mom\u2019s will? My husband got a call from his ex SIL last night saying that her two oldest daughters (17 and 14) had taken an uber with their cats and belongings to go stay with their dad (husband\u2019s brother). The girls told their mom that they\u2019re moving in with their dad because of their mom\u2019s boyfriend. Husband\u2019s brother had no idea until husband called to tell him. Husband\u2019s brother and ex SIL had a bitter divorce and are not on speaking terms. Husband\u2019s brother was also not in his daughters\u2019 lives for 3 years while he dealt with his own mental/addiction issues. He has recently tried to make amends and repair his relationship with the girls, but still refuses to talk to or see their mom, so it\u2019s usually us or husband\u2019s mom that must mediate visits as the girls\u2019 mom has full custody. After the girls showed up on their dad\u2019s doorstep, their mom arrived soon after, cops got involved, and there was some arguing between the girls and their mom until we offered to have the girls stay the night with us. We try to stay on good terms with the girls\u2019 mom to facilitate communication with the girls, so she accepted this over letting them stay with their dad on the condition we stay in constant contact with her.  This morning, we asked the girls for specifics on what\u2019s going on and they said that they are fed up with their mom\u2019s boyfriend and he is always yelling at or berating them. They also said he is \u201ccreepy and touchy\u201d. When we asked for specifics, they said he yells at them about not wearing bras. The oldest has mentioned moving out in the past and the mom\u2019s bf threatened \u201cI have lawyers little girl. I will ruin your life so you can\u2019t ever go to college.\u201d He seems to be the most aggressive and cruel to her. The 14-year-old appears to have the worst problems as she doesn\u2019t work like the oldest and is around more. She said he forces hugs on her when she\u2019s not wearing a bra even though she asks him to stop. When she brought this up to her mom, she got annoyed and told her that he\u2019s just trying to bond with her. She said that he grabs her by the waist to move her out of the way even though there is ample room to go around her. Both girls say they don\u2019t feel safe or comfortable in their own home and will stay in their rooms with their ears to the door to make sure they don\u2019t hear him outside before they will leave the room.  They both want to move in with their dad permanently, and their dad wants to take full custody of them. My husband and I said we need to talk to a lawyer and go about this carefully, but with their dad having been out of the picture for about three years, I\u2019m not sure how much of a chance he has. We left a message with a lawyer and expect a call back tomorrow, but I expect we'll have to have a conversation with the girls' mom before then. We also want to discuss grandparent\u2019s rights with the lawyer when we have the chance since husband\u2019s mother has been involved with the girls all their lives and takes care of all their major expenses. The girls\u2019 mom wanted to pick them up today, but we asked her to let the girls stay with us one more night and we can all talk tomorrow. We don\u2019t want to force the girls to go back home with their mom knowing that they\u2019re uncomfortable with their mom\u2019s bf, but I\u2019m not sure we can keep them against their mom\u2019s will if she forces it. I guess what I want to know is, can we tell their mom that we won\u2019t let the girls go back home while her boyfriend is in the same house? Or will this cause us more problems when husband\u2019s brother/mother pursues custody later? The girls have one more younger sister with special needs who is in the house, so we are also concerned for her safety, but the girls make it sound like he doesn\u2019t give her a problem really.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Not a lawyer- I think one of the things that needs to happen is to involve child protective services. It sounds like bf is a little too handsy and if the girls feel uncomfortable enough to say something to mom and then be ignored, someone else needs to be also looking out for girls best interest. Additionally, the CPS will most likely involve Dad and others that care for the girls and will determine the best place for them to be. If the girls tell CPS they are afraid of bf and mom blows them off, they may determine it is best to have the girls stay with someone else. The girls feeling the way they do about this man should be really listened to, and they should not go back there if they feel unsafe. This is tough, and I wish you the best.",
            " First, Not a lawyer. Second, as a victim of abuse, absolutely call CPS immediately. This is grooming behavior from mom's BF. It will only get worse, especially since mom doesn't seem to care. Third, be the advocates these girls need, stand up for them however you need to to keep them safe. Consulting the attorney is a good start, but CPS needs to be brought in also.  This is a sticky situation for everyone involved, but hopefully the law and luck will be on the side of these young ladies to put them out of harm's reach.",

            " One thing to check as soon as possible-- Is this guy on probation?  The reason this is relevant is that sexual abusers will often have a criminal history of doing this. This is important in two ways-- one, it helps build a case for CPS to take action and for the father to potentially get custody. And two, more importantly, if the guy is on probation for sexual crimes he may have a condition of probation that says he can't be near minors. If this is the case a call to his PO could get him away from the kids right quick.     In most states you can check online or just call the county Corrections Department.

    "\n\nHuman: Son's daycare is logging my child in and refusing to refund money I am in NJ. In April my 5 year old sons daycare closed due to covid. After months of that it reopened in september and of course, he wanted back in to be with his friends. So i sent him back. Then October 30th we received a call from his daycare that his teacher had tested positive for covid. We are a high risk household. My fiance\u00e8 was pregnant with a nicu baby and my elderly stepfather we take care of has MS and is very high risk. Clearly, we pulled my son from school.   The problem lies in the fact that on October 25th, i had paid his november tuition in advance. When i contacted the school to discuss a refund do to an unsafe environment amidst the pandemic and high risk household, they stopped communicating with me. Then beginning at the end of november i saw that they started logging him in and put of activities at school through an app that monitors his day with updates of what he is doing. I have pictures and videos of me and him at my house playing when they are logging him for culircle time or lunch and things like that. I am not certain if this is to try to keep my money and claim that he is attending school or because they are trying to claim he is attending to defraud the govt for funds. I have not yet spoken with the school about the log ins as they seem fairly unwilling to communicate with me after my refund request.  Either way, my question is what agency do i contact to discuss this situation? Is this a covid relief situation where i contact those authorities? Is this a state level funding issue? Should i attempt to contact the school and specifically address the log ins or do i just go straight to the group that oversees certain aspects?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: [NSW, Australia] Need to get out of home ASAP. Don't have tax file number, don't have birth certificate. Need to get far away quickly, have a few hundred in cash. What do I do? I turned 18 a couple days ago. It's no longer safe for me to remain at home. My mum's destroyed my birth certificate to prevent me getting TFN and a job. I have about $600 cash, and $3500 in bank but my mum's cosigned on my account so I probably can't access any of it. I pretty much have no life skills but I'm a fast learner, and physically fit so I can probably cover a large distance with that $600. I need to get my birth certificate replaced, then I can get a TFN and a job, then I should be alright. If possible I'd like to get out of the state, maybe get to Melbourne or Adelaide. Problem is I've got basically nothing in the way of proof of ID, just my student ID from school, mum took my medicare card and I never could apply for a driver's license. I should be able to get out Monday night or real early Tuesday morning. What should I do from here?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: School wants my son's Facebook password & email, also wants us to hand over any phone or computer that he's had access to in the last year. WTF? [Florida] My son is 15.  Today I received a phone call from the school, telling me that they are doing an investigation into a series of very serious incidents that happened last year and they would like to have the password for my son's Facebook account, also asking me to disable two-step verification if his account has it. They also said it would really be a great help if I hand over any phones, tablets or computers that my son has had access to in the last year, removing any passcode or login restriction.  I was shocked about hearing this. I asked about the incident and I was told that they can't tell me since it doesn't directly concern my son, that they only seek this to see if there has been any mention of it in the communications that my son has had with his friends which might help them uncover some information.  I declined. Told them that I'm happy to talk to them about the incident in person if it concerns my son but other than that this is very unreasonable and really none of our business. I was told something along the lines of \"I strongly recommend you to help us. This is a very serious issue for a few other students and to be honest with you refusal will have some consequences, I'm mostly talking about your son's future at the school in the coming school year and but also potentially legally. I really hope you cooperate for all our sake.\"  I told her to send us what they want in writing. She said that she hopes we're not trying to make this difficult as \"lives are on the line here\", I insisted that I want it for my records. She said they might do that.  So my question is... WTF? They can't be serious about this. My instinct is to get a lawyer if we received anything in writing but really what I'm wondering about is how far can they go in this so-called \"investigation\"? Let's say when school starts, my son takes a phone or iPad to school? Can they confiscate and look through it? Can they force him to reveal the passcode to it or force him to use his fingerprint to unlock? How do I make sure they can't just invade our privacy like that?\n\nAssistant:": {

Other than that, make sure any electronic that your son takes to school is password protected with long alphanumeric passwords (rather than 4-digit numbers), and do not enable fingerprint reader on them. If they give your son a paper to sign for the use of IT stuff, make sure to read every point to make sure it doesn't have any weird clause where they allow themselves to install keyloggers or spyware or even make admin accounts on the computers.  Also make sure his Facebook, emails and other social media are secure with two-factor authentication, and make sure they can't reset the password by only using text.

She recently noticed that she hasn't been getting her usual statements (credit card, mortgage, etc.) from her bank, so she checked in with the bank last week and discovered that her mailing address, phone number, and online banking password had all been changed. The mailing address is a PO box that her husband has been using for communication with her (I don't think he wants her to know where he's living), and the phone number is his as well.
