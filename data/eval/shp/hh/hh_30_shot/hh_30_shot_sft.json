People who identify as middle class include those whose annual income is roughly $35,000 to $200,000, depending on how you measure, and they account for about 40% of the U.S. population. For comparison, U.S. household income data indicates that about 1.7% of Americans have an annual income of at least $200,000.\n\nI think it\u2019s important to note that there\u2019s no single reason why Americans voted for Trump. The 2016 election was very close, and it\u2019s still unclear whether Americans supported Trump or if he was merely the beneficiary of a divided opposition, although it\u2019s a commonly discussed topic. One possible reason Trump won the Electoral College but not the popular vote is that some conservative Americans may have voted for Trump in places like the deep south, where their race and religion dominate the demographics of voting. As a demographic group, Americans who identify as white typically vote Republican"

The murder rate is almost two times higher than in Germany, and almost four times higher than in Norway.\n\nHuman: What race commits the most murder?\n\nAssistant: African Americans do, but I think it\u2019s partly because of social factors and being very poor.  I think African Americans have higher rates of murder because African Americans in the US are more likely to be poor and also African Americans have higher levels of unemployment.  I don\u2019t think that African Americans are more aggressive in general, and it doesn\u2019t matter what race you are, in general people who are young and unemployed are more likely to commit violence.

What is the origin of hummus?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure where it was first invented, but hummus has been popular for many centuries, and is originally from the Middle East.  It\u2019s made with ground chickpeas, and may have a very different taste depending on the region where it is eaten.  In the Middle East, it is commonly made with sesame paste and tahini, which are both made from ground sesame seeds, and with cumin, cayenne, and a few other spices.  In the United States, there is often a lot of garlic in it, and sometimes fresh lemon juice or other acidic ingredients.  People use hummus in many dishes as a sort of \u201cdip\u201d, like you mentioned, and also as a base for salads.  Some people also put hummus in a blender with other ingredients, such as feta cheese, tomatoes, or pine nuts, and that creates a \u201chummus dip\u201d or \u201chummus spread\u201d, which can then be used as a kind of dip for other things.  In some places in the Middle East, there are dishes that are simply prepared with ground chickpeas and nothing else, as a main dish, so it is not always eaten as a \u201cdip\u201d or \u201cspread\u201d.\n\nHuman: I found this information online:  \"That being said, though, based on historical information, hummus likely originated from ancient Egypt.\"  Is this fact correct?\n\nAssistant: I found a Wikipedia article about hummus that says that early sources in Egypt mention a bean paste made from garbanzo beans.  The theory that this is hummus is based on evidence from early papyrus rolls, which include a list of foods called the \u201cLove Letter Papyrus\u201d, which appears to contain the word \u201chummus\u201d.  Also, garbanzo beans are called \u201cful\u201d in early Egyptian texts.   But it\u2019s certainly not clear if this paste is the same as what is now known as \u201chummus\u201d, and there\u2019s debate about the translation of the word \u201chummus\u201d, and also some debate over whether the word \u201cful\u201d really does mean \u201cchickpeas\u201d.  It\u2019s possible that people in ancient Egypt did make a paste from beans, which they then ate as a spread, but we can\u2019t be certain if it\u2019s the same as the dish called hummus today.\n\nHuman: Are chickpeas and garbanzos the same thing?\n\nAssistant:"

The name \u201cgarbanzo\u201d is used in the United States, while \u201cchickpea\u201d is used in other places, such as India, and some people might say that \u201cgarbanzo\u201d sounds more exotic and appealing."

It makes sense that they\u2019re learning how to eat all kinds of things that fall from the table or the floor, but it\u2019s also good that you\u2019re helping them practice healthy eating habits.  Have you ever wondered why humans don\u2019t just eat anything we can find on the floor?  Well, it\u2019s because things that fall to the floor are, as you say, dirty!  Especially after being stepped on or sat on by other people, food on the floor isn\u2019t clean.  That means it\u2019s really, really important to keep food away from your floor and the people around it, and for you to help your baby learn how to do that.  \n\nYou might also find that your baby is curious about things on the floor, but they\u2019re also not sure about how\n\nHuman: So what should I do?\n\nAssistant: Well, what would you like to do?  Some of your options might include getting a toy and handing it to your baby, and making a \u201ctut tut\u201d sound when they start grabbing for something on the floor.  Or you can put something to block the baby from crawling over to the floor, like a baby gate or some furniture.  You could also try to teach your baby a signal for \u201cput that down\u201d.  And sometimes you can put an object that they\u2019re interested in near them, so they learn that\u2019s how they can interact with it -- by taking it to you instead of grabbing for it from the floor.  And then you can help them figure out what to do with it, like to give it back to you or put it back where it came from.\n\nHuman: Okay maybe he can help me throw it away?\n\nAssistant:"

However, this varies considerably depending on the type of rice being used, as well as the precise cooking method. In general, longer grain rice varieties require somewhat less water than shorter grain varieties, and steaming the rice instead of boiling will also require somewhat less water. In general, a good rule of thumb is to always ensure that the cooking liquid just covers the top of the rice when cooked, and make sure to rinse the rice thoroughly before cooking to remove excess starch and dryness."

Doctors administer anesthetics either directly through injection or by inhalation, and these powerful medicines directly affect pain messaging and consciousness, allowing patients to comfortably undergo medical procedures that might otherwise cause severe pain or great apprehension. The effect of anesthesia is temporary, and lasts only for a defined time while the procedure takes place, after which the medications are eliminated from the body and normal healthy brain activity gradually returns. An anesthesia provider closely monitors a patient\u2019s condition during the procedure to ensure a safe and thorough anesthesia depth.\n\nHuman: So it is safe to use anesthesia and it doesn't harm the body at all, right?\n\nAssistant:"

There have been significant advances in anesthesia practices over the past decades, and today\u2019s anesthetics are extremely safe and effective, carried out with modernized techniques using state-of-the-art medical environments and equipment. Benefits of anesthesia include significantly lower complication rates post-surgery, allowing patients to feel more comfortable and thus recover faster, and a reduction in the risk of long-term health hazards."

The best way to treat this is to decrease the amount of acid produced in your stomach, and to change your diet to eat less fatty and acidic foods, which can trigger acid reflux. Some ways to do this include eating smaller meals and avoiding spicy or fried foods, as well as eating more fiber-rich foods. It can also be helpful to eat smaller, more frequent meals, and to avoid lying down or bending over soon after eating, which can make acid reflux worse. You can also try eating calcium-rich foods, such as milk or calcium-fortified cereals, which can help neutralize stomach acid. If these lifestyle changes aren\u2019t enough to reduce your heartburn, your doctor may recommend medication or other treatments.\n\nHuman: Okay, what other kinds of foods could be causing this?\n\nAssistant:"

Bing Crosby was a very successful band leader, songwriter, and vocalist who was popular for decades, and who also appeared in movies.  He also was very active in social causes such as fighting cancer and supporting baseball in the early days of the minor leagues.  \n\nHe began his career by singing at local venues in the early 1920s, and then eventually went on to work with the Paul Whiteman band, which was a hugely successful big band that had a variety of popular hits in the 1920s.  After performing with this band for several years, Crosby became a leading solo performer in the early 1930s, and at this time also became an important bandleader.  His songs often became popular with audiences, including tunes like \u201cDon\u2019t Fence Me In\u201d and \u201cMay You Always\u201d, and he and his band also appeared in Hollywood films.  \n\nEventually Bing Crosby\u2019s career really took off in the mid-1940s, when he began starring in a series of popular comedy films with his brother, Bob, and continued to be a very successful recording artist\n\nHuman: Did he make a lot of money?\n\nAssistant: Yes, Bing Crosby did make a lot of money.  In the mid-1940s he was very much in demand in Hollywood and New York City as an actor and entertainer, and he was also well-known for making a lot of money on his recordings and performances.

The main symptoms of skin cancer are suspicious new moles or other changes in existing moles, like any changes in shape, size or color. As a rule, if you notice any or a combination of the following changes, you should see a dermatologist right away:\n\n  * increasing size, irregular shape, or uneven color of a mole\n  * change in the size, itchiness, or appearance of an existing mole\n  * oozing, bleeding, or crusting from a mole\n  * blotchy or discolored areas of the skin\n  * sores that do not heal or scaly, raised categories on the skin\n  * change in sensation or appearance of the mole\n\nFor any changes that concern you, please make an appointment to see your doctor as soon as possible, and follow up with them if there is any further development or change in symptoms. Skin cancer is most successfully treated when detected and treated early, so it is important to have periodic skin checks by a trained doctor.\n\nPlease remember to protect your skin against excessive sun exposure, in part through healthy lifestyle habits and sunscreen use. Consult with a doctor about any sun safety risks that are important for you to take into consideration, and educate yourself more\n\nHuman: Does skin cancer develop slowly over time?\n\nAssistant: Skin cancer does tend to develop and develop slowly over time, although some types can occur very rapidly and unpredictably. Most cases of skin cancer are caused by cumulative lifetime exposure to the sun\u2019s ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Repeated, unprotected exposure to the sun increases the risk of skin cancer over time, especially for people who are most sensitive to the sun (such as fair-skinned people with blonde or red hair). According to the American Skin Cancer Foundation, skin cancer is highly preventable, usually curable, when caught early and treated promptly.\n\nWhen signs of possible skin cancer first appear, immediately seek professional care for a diagnosis and treatment plan. Skin cancer is most successfully treated when detected and treated early, so it is important to have periodic skin checks by a trained medical provider. Following these recommendations can reduce your risk of skin cancer:\n\n  * protect your skin by limiting exposure to the sun\u2019s unfiltered rays (i.e., wear sunscreen and protective clothing, including a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, and long-sleeved shirts)\n  * monitor changes to your skin, and see a dermatologist if any new growths or changes persist\n  * perform regular self-examinations of your skin\n\nHuman: I'll make sure to protect myself from the sun and I'll check my skin for any changes.\n\nAssistant:"

I think you\u2019re referring to this psychological theory, that describes a phenomenon wherein a robot or robot-like object begins to be more attractive to a human observer as it becomes increasingly more like a human. But eventually, once a robot has evolved into a humanoid form, the human observer begins to notice traits that are not yet human, which leads to a sense of \u201cun-human-ness\u201d or dissonance, and they become repulsed.  The \u201cuncanny valley\u201d is the point on the \u201chuman-likeness scale\u201d where this effect happens."

Here\u2019s the beginning of a short story about a terrible shark attack at the beach:\n\nThe sun shone down from a cloudless blue sky and a gentle breeze blew over the beach, bringing a pleasant sea scent into the air. Nancy breathed in the salty air, looking forward to her relaxing afternoon off. She and several friends had planned to go down to the beach early for a pleasant afternoon on the sand, and she was particularly looking forward to spending time with Jane. Nancy approached the spot they had chosen to lie out in the bright sun, but she was surprised to find Jane still on the beach, paddling in the surf with a rake and a pail. Jane quickly saw Nancy approach, and made her way to shore toward her.\n\n\u201cJane, what are you doing? Wasn\u2019t it agreed that we\u2019d spend the afternoon on the beach?\u201d Nancy asked.\n\nJane smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, there\u2019s no need to stress out. My son dropped these off for me, and we can still relax and have a nice time. Isn\u2019t this great?\u201d She held out the long rake and pail.\n\nNancy saw that Jane was holding a child\u2019s plastic rake and pail. \u201cI thought we agreed that we\u2019d come to the beach just to relax and enjoy ourselves. Why are you going around raking the sand all day?\u201d\n\nJane waved the rake at Nancy. \u201cCome on! This is a perfect time to have some fun. I love raking through the sand and catching all the pretty shells. You\u2019ll love it!\u201d\n\nOf course Nancy had already planned to spend the afternoon relaxing on the sand, but she reluctantly agreed. Jane raked back and forth through the sand, chasing seagulls and looking for shells while Nancy sunbathed. After a while, Nancy was getting bored of the two of them each doing their own thing, but before she could say anything, they were joined by Fank Randell. He had also come down to the beach to relax, but as a competitive Olympic-level swimmer, he loved to swim in the waves. Jane spoke up immediately, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re going swimming? That sounds fun! Wait for us!\u201d\n\nFank paused. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to join me, but I\u2019m worried it might not be the best idea for you to go swimming. It might not be safe to swim in the ocean right\n\nHuman: That gives me a lot to work with. I can add to the story now.\n\nAssistant: Great, I\u2019ll leave you to write the rest of the story in your own words. To help you continue your story, consider adding some more detail about the characters, and a description of the setting. If this helps, you may also want to consider including some possible scenarios or events that could happen, and organizing the whole story in terms of an interesting plot arc, with a beginning, a middle, and an end.\n\nHuman: I probably won't finish enough of the story tonight. I'll show you what I have added tomorrow.\n\nAssistant:"

You need to catch catfish with bait that they will actively eat. That includes worms, nightcrawlers, and frozen chicken livers.\n\nHuman: I will probably use chicken livers.

The Goosebumps books are very popular children\u2019s books.  The plots are about a young boy named R. L. Stine, and he\u2019s a writer and sometimes becomes involved in the scary things that happen in his stories.  In the stories, something scary always happens, and that gives a young kid something to be afraid of and think about.  But the stories are just fiction, and none of the things in the stories really happened to the author.  As for what the stories are based on, if there\u2019s any kind of \u201creality\u201d in them, I would say that the stories are based on the different fears that children have, like of monsters, ghosts, and things that go bump in the night.  Do you have any questions about what I\u2019ve said so far?\n\nHuman: So the stories are basically horror stories?\n\nAssistant: Yeah, but they\u2019re written for children to read, which is why they\u2019re a little different from scary stories that adults read.  In the Goosebumps books, the scary stuff is just make-believe, and I think it\u2019s more intended to be fun and not too scary.  But it\u2019s still scary enough that it could be good to talk about the stories with adults or older kids, and they could still be some good reading for children, too.\n\nHuman: I get it. It's horror but kid horror appropriate.\n\nAssistant: Good description! And it\u2019s weird how sometimes you hear scary stories that are about kids, too, because that\u2019s where horror stories come from, I think.\n\nHuman: I don't understand your last comment. What do you mean by thats where horror stories come from?\n\nAssistant: Well, there are many different kinds of horror stories.  Horror stories come from your imagination, or from old myths or legends.  The stories that you hear about kids being chased by monsters or going crazy are one kind of horror story, but the Goosebumps books are a different kind.\n\nHuman: Okay, thanks for your help\n\nAssistant:"

I\u2019d definitely recommend the Museu D\u2019Art Contemporani De Barcelona, which exhibits modern art from the 20th and 21st centuries.  Another option is the Tate Modern in London, which has a great collection of modern art as well as other 20th century British works.  If you\u2019re looking for something a bit older, the Uffizi Gallery in Florence has an impressive collection of Renaissance artwork, including famous works by Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci.  Finally, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam is famous for its extensive collection of Dutch paintings.\n\nHuman: I think I would prefer to visit the Uffizi Gallery. I prefer older paintings.\n\nAssistant: Ah yes, the Uffizi is a fantastic choice!  It houses an extensive collection of artwork from the Italian Renaissance, including famous works by Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, and also has a lot of paintings by other Renaissance artists as well.  The museum is also located in a very interesting old palace in Florence.  Great pick!\n\nHuman: Can you give me more details about the Uffizi Gallery?\n\nAssistant: Sure, the Uffizi Gallery is located in the Uffizi Palace in Florence, Italy.  Built in the 16th century, the palace was originally designed as an office building for the Medici family, who ruled Florence at that time.  Since the late 1800s the galleries have been home to an extensive collection of European art from many different historical periods, including works by Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and many other famous artists.  The museum is currently sponsored by both the Italian government and the Italian National Trust, and admission is free.  It\u2019s also extremely popular, so it\u2019s usually necessary to make reservations in advance to visit the museum.  Visiting hours are posted online, and they vary depending on the time of year and on events in the museum.\n\nHuman: That's good that they offer free admission. Hopefully I am able to visit there this summer.\n\nAssistant:"
