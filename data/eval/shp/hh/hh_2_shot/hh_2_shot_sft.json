So if you were to put your hand over a gas stove burner, you would feel that the heat coming out is very warm, and the temperature is quite constant. If you put your hand closer to the burner, the temperature would go up, and if you moved your hand closer to the flame, it would feel very hot.\n\nOn the other hand, in induction stoves, the induction coil gets very hot, so that any kind of metal pan placed over it will heat up quickly. So if you were to put your hand on top of an induction stove, you would feel that the temperature isn\u2019t as warm, and the temperature would be much less constant. If you put your hand closer to the burner, the temperature would go up, and if you moved your hand closer to the flame, it would feel much hotter.\n\nHuman: I see. And is it true that you need to use different kinds of pots and pans if you buy an induction stove?\n\nAssistant:"

Also, the pan and the pan holder (the part that you put the pan on top of) need to be non-magnetic, or the induction cooker won\u2019t work as well."
