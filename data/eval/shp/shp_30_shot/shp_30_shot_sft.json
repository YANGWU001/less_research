It was seriously facepalm city and there were a number of incidents where the whole thing was so stupid I didn't even bother reporting it.    Like, three of them would be sitting in a row and all super obviously copying off each other.  The department's policy was to let them finish and just make a mark on their papers when they hand it in and then decide what to do.  So I collect them all and mark them and they all have the same answers and I mark it all up and... they all got 63%.  Like what was the point in that?

I applied to grad schools for physics this past year and failed spectacularly: I was rejected from every single PhD program I applied to. There is a silver lining however: I got accepted into a master's program at a great school, and I have a good job offer in the city of my current school, so things certainly could have gone worse. Here's the issue: my parents really want me to go to the master's program, while all my professors are telling me not to go.  As far as I can tell, my parents are looking at the name and prestige of the school, and think the master's program will greatly improve my application to PhD programs. They also think that my current department has screwed me with bad advice leading up to my PhD applications, and that I'm not likely to do much better next year if I stay where I am.  On the other hand, my professors think that the master's program is not likely to help my applications unless I do significant research, and it will be harder to find research as a master's student than a PhD student. If I stay here, I have enough connections within the department to work with almost any professor here. They think that if I can get something published and get a better physics GRE score, then I should have no problem at all with grad schools next year.  From my perspective, I think the master's program would be an enjoyable experience, and would give me the opportunity to see first-hand if I really want to pursue a physics PhD, or if I'd rather pursue a math PhD or something else entirely. I'm also fairly confident that I would do well in the master's program, and could even potentially use the program as a gateway to the PhD program at the same school. On the other hand, I could easily end up in a new city with no friends, no connections within the department, and no time between grad courses and potential research to study for and do better on the physics GRE, which I think was the biggest thing holding my applications back. Not to mention, the master's program would cost an entire year's tuition. While paying for the program isn't an issue, I have serious ethical concerns with spending so much money on graduate school, when I would be paid to do the same thing in a PhD program.  If I stay here, I think I would also enjoy the job I've been offered, and if I can get some research done on the side and do better on the physics GRE, then I agree that my application would be fairly iron-clad. But there's always the possibility that I can't get anything published, or that I don't do much better on the physics GRE, or maybe even that I get a publication and better physics GRE score but no better results. In addition, funding for the job offer won't go through until May, and while I've been assured that it almost certainly won't happen, there's always the chance that the job doesn't get funded (I have to decide on the master's program within a week, so I'd be crossing my fingers that the job works out). There's even the chance that I get the job, but it doesn't leave me with adequate time to also do research, at which point I'm not sure how much better my application would be.  I know this has been a super long post, but if anyone's made it to this part, any advice on what I might do? My first instinct is that my parents don't know what they're talking about and that my professors do, but I do think there's more than a kernel of truth that they've already given me bad advice with regards to my PhD applications, and I'm scared to take their advice and find that I've made the same mistake several times in a row.\n\nAssistant:"

I am a generalist, who inserts my brain into whatever problem I am directed at and solves the problem.

I also like to teach, so I was considering if I should pursue a career as lecturer.

I did some soul searching, has some serious conversations with my girlfriend (now wife), and realized that I enjoyed the teaching environment to that of the purely research environment. (I was an art major as an undergrad until I ran into some incredible professors in the math department who challenged me, kept me interested, and were very friendly and open to social interactions). As a result of this discovery, I ended up applying for tenure track positions at smaller universities.  I managed to land one right out of grad school and have loved the living daylights out of it every day since.  I get to teach, maybe give back to a few students who might be in a similar position to me when I was their age; I get to do research at a pace I find acceptable; and I get to be part of a department what really works as a cohesive unit to keep things running smoothly.    So, this might seem like a bit of a rambling response, but consider what got you into bioinformatics and genetics.  Why those areas, why not chemistry or philosophy instead?  Focus on those reasons and try to figure out what jobs really relate to those specifics.  Lastly, you like to teach, so have you considered that with your education and \"prestigious research institution\" post-doc, you might be a really great candidate for a tenure track position at a smaller university?

Since the offer, I've had an initial formal offer letter and some communication via email with the admin people at the research institute.  &#x200B;  I've now received an email saying that the institute's director (who was one of my interviewers) would like an 'informal chat' about the post, including discussing an overseas trip to a conference around when I'd be starting the position. I asked whether I should prepare anything and they said 'no need, look forward to seeing you then'.  &#x200B;  I'm sure I'm just being paranoid but I'm freaking out a bit about what this meeting could concern. Since I'm already living in the town in which the research institute is based, my husband thinks that the director just wants to do things face-to-face and that I have nothing to worry about.  &#x200B;  Has anyone had a similar experience? Please don't judge me for being so anxious - it was so hard to get this job and I think I'm just worried it could slip out of my hands for some reason :/\n\nAssistant:"

I was asked by a former professor to write a letter of rec for his promotion to tenure track/associate professor.

I've searched Reddit for all the advice concerning how to write a good tenure letter of rec from a student perspective, which has been very helpful, but something's still not clicking. Generally, I'm one of those people who need an example of something before I understand how to do it, and while I've found example letters of rec from professors to students on the web, I haven't found the reverse.   Without an example letter to work off of, I'm concerned that I'm talking about \\*myself\\* too much in the letter (focusing on my experience in the classroom with the professor, how he helped me get into grad school, how much his class taught/impacted me, etc) as opposed to talking about the professor himself. But the point of such a letter is to emphasize the positive impact he has on students, right? I'm having a hard time understanding how much to center my own experience of the professor versus talk more generally about his virtues.

The process is extremely inefficient, and although different search engines make it easier (Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, etc.), it is far from optimal.  Not only that, but many good papers are lost in a sea of thousands of bad ones. It's hard to find them, and it's easy to waste time on reinventing them instead of improving them.  Our idea is to create a platform that automates this work, at least partially.  In the beginning, it would use the APIs of Semantic Scholar and other search engines, later we would implement an AI system ourselves. We also plan to limit the platform to the field of Computer Science, and later extend it to other fields.  In its simplest version, the platform would take a paper as input and output a citation subgraph with useful information extracted from it.  A citation graph can easily explode to thousands of papers within two levels, so it is necessary that the platform does some kind of selection, and some filters are provided to the users for that purpose.  Those filters would take into account parameters like, for example, the number of citations, but without penalizing recent papers with high potential.  For example, the papers could be classified into methods, applications, and reviews; so that different classes of papers are shown from the selection of different filters.  For a given paper, the platform would extract its hierarchy from its citation graph. If only \"methods\" are selected, the hierarchy would show the papers from which the method evolved from, and the subsequent papers that evolved from that method.  Here are some other things that the platform could do:  \\- Automatically find the standards used in a given field and compare methods, results, metrics, benchmarks.  \\- Evaluate the \"innovation potential\" of a given field: how much can it still be improved and how easily? How large are the improvements in that field? How many papers are published? Is the interest in that field dying or accelerating?  \\- Automatically create a summary of the implementation details for replicability purposes.  \\- Automatically find new areas of possible improvements.  \\- Allow users to open issues on papers (as it's done on Github) and implement crowd review (later).  I think that drastically reducing the time spending on reviewing scientific literature would increase productivity by a lot, but I would love to hear your feedback on this. Thank you!\n\nAssistant:"

At some point automating the decision of what papers to read is just as hard as automating the research itself.

I host a personal web-service to do this for me and its ridiculous that it doesn't exist in a more user-friendly way.

I'd definitely keep my clothes professional but I'm a 35 y.o. dude, and while teaching or presenting in a conference as my authentic self sounds exhilarating, I know it's an image I can't take back--especially if it's one of those 300-student survey.   I'm wondering if anyone has any related experiences or feedback. Would you care if a male professor in your department suddenly would show up here and there in feminine clothing? Hesitant to see him/her representing the department?\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " There's a number of elements that have to be teased out here. Firstly we have to look at the differences in the context of their fieldwork. Mead did her fieldwork in a fairly isolated corner of Samoa in the 1920s. As a young woman, she had better access to informants who were also young woman. Freeman worked in Samoa at various points beginning in the 1940s. Freeman worked in a different area and was generally more connected with chiefs and higher-ups. This time difference is also important because of increasing US influence and conversion to Christianity.  The work of either is not considered entirely discredited, even by their respective opponents. So we have to separate out to some degree this fieldwork from the accusations made against Mead by Freeman.  Now to get to the reactions to Freeman. The initial reactions and the ones that continued on throughout the 1980s were largely dismissive of Freeman. However, the most interesting critiques were probably by those who critiqued both Mead and Freeman. Some of the broad brush accusations made against Mead had some truth to them. Eleanor Leacock agreed that Mead had romanticized Samoa to some extent, but not to the extent that Freeman claimed. Bradd Shore believed the overall picture was somewhere between Mead and Freeman.  However, Shore, Leacock and others (I am also drawing on recent histories by James Cote, Paul Shankman, and Martin Orans here) demonstrate both that Freeman systematically misrepresented Mead on many points and had a number of inconsistencies in his accusations. For example, some of Freeman's own work -- statistics and interviews -- contradicted his own claims.  The biggest misrepresentation, though, is Freeman's later claim that Mead was \"hoaxed\" by an informant. Freeman misrepresented this informant as being key to Mead's fieldwork and conclusion about sexual activity. This was not true -- Mead devoted only a few sentences to her in Coming of Age. The interview which the hoax claim was derived from was dubious in a number of ways. The interviewee was with a relative of the chief and a higher-up in the Samoan government. Admitting to pre-marital sexual relations was taboo in this context. By the 1980s, many Samoans considered pre-Christian social practices (esp. pre-marital sex) to be a sort of dark age period and mentioning them was dishonorable. The manuscripts of unpublished interviews show inconsistencies in the informant's testimony as well. Recent histories of the controversies all consider this hoaxing idea to be entirely discredited. Even Orans, whose *Not Even Wrong* was a huge criticism of Mead, was at pains to show that the hoax hypothesis was false. Cote, Shankman, and Orans are unanimous on the fact that Freeman distorted Mead's work.  Also, Freeman like to portray himself as a level-headed scientist fighting against lunatic ideologues. Freeman himself was however not purely calm and rational during this controversy. He bullied his opponents, even trying to have some of their doctorates revoked.

His job is to protect the Sun as it makes a nightly journey through the underworld, and he guided the souls of the dead through the underworld as well. Cereberus guards the Greek underworld to prevent the dead from escaping.  Role two: Feral dogs or wild dogs, however, will scavenge the corpses of the dead if they have they chance. The same goes for many members of the canine family, like jackals (Anubis), wolves, and coyotes. In addition, dogs are...well, they are dogs. They eat poop, roll in dead things, and can be reservoirs for disease-causing fleas and ticks.

They were misnamed by Biblical archeologists looking to connect their discoveries with peoples mentioned in the Bible. If the Biblical Hittites actually were the Hatti, it's possible that they have some connection with the archeological Hittites since the Hittite Empire conquered the lands of the Hatti (though the Hatti themselves are generally considered to be unrelated linguistically to the dominant ethnic group of the Hittite Empire)."

Every single forensic anthropologist I know is professor who is occasionally contacted by law enforcement when they are needed. I completely abandoned forensic anthropology and I am getting a PhD/MPH in medical anthropology because I felt like the field was at a dead end of sorts.  In my opinion, the most viable path for someone interested in this field is to get a PhD in bioachaeology and do research as your primary job while keeping some forensics skills in your tool belt. It's worth pointing out the the academic job market is also hellish at the moment and even the most outstanding PhDs are struggling to find tenure track academic positions. That said, it is possible that you might be able to leverage a degree in forensic anthropology to get other law enforcement-related jobs.

Not robots.   >**But hunter gatherers need to be constantly on the move.**   First... Hunter-gatherers aren't \"constantly on the move.\" While mobility strategies vary *significantly* across time and space-- geographic region, environment, population / group size, etc.-- most ethnographic data suggests duration of occupation of locations ranges from a few weeks to a season to-- in the case of sedentary hunter gatherers in extremely rich environments-- indefinite periods of time.  In my opinion, the biggest disservice that 1950s through 1970s hunter-gatherer ethnographic studies did to our concept of hunter-gatherers was to frame hunter-gatherers *in general* in terms of groups like the Hadza, who live in relatively marginal environments. Evidence from around the world suggests that in a significant number of cases-- perhaps the majority-- hunter-gatherers occupied fairly abundant environments.  Second...  >**They need every hand available in order for the tribe to survive.**  Viewing people in a society purely from their utilitarian value is not justified or appropriate. People are more than the number of calories they can produce.  Members of hunter-gatherer groups provide other value to their groups besides simply how many palm fruits they could carry today. But even from a strictly utilitarian perspective, older and less mobile members of a group have significant value. Children may or may not be able to leave the camp. These less mobile members of the group can provide child care. They can also assist with tasks in-camp.  From a less utilitarian perspective, older members of a group represent a source of knowledge and experience. They are the institutional memory.  >**Now in such a situation, what happened to people who were old and sick? Hunter gatherers did not have the tools or the infrastructure to carry people around on a long term basis, right? So how did they deal with them?**  **They cared / care for them.**  Hunter-gatherer groups absolutely have the capability to transport members of their group(s) who are unable to transport themselves, fully or partially.  But here's the thing.  We have abundant evidence from the archaeological and paleontological record that members of ancient hunter-gatherer groups *did* in fact provide long-term care for disabled members of their societies.  The instances of healed injuries that-- when they were unhealed-- would have been incredibly debilitating are too innumerable to mention. Broken bones, severely in some cases, that would not have healed rapidly. One case I recall examining when in grad school involved a series of rib fractures across one entire side of the rib cage. Probably a result of a blunt force impact. They were healed, but having had *one* broken rib in my life, I can attest to the debilitation that this person would have experienced.  Here's another one that I tend to view as especially significant.  **https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2686462/**  In northeast Florida sometime between 6000 and 8000 years ago, one group of people who would have been nothing but hunter-gatherers, cared for and supported a disabled child from birth to the age of 15 or so. Then when he died, likely from a massive systemic infection, they buried him carefully where they buried other members of their group.  The child was born with spina bifida, a condition that was not curable at the time, nor was it really treatable. The child-- a boy-- would have had likely neurological defects that would have left him pretty disabled, and certainly not able to contribute to the daily caloric requirement of the group.  His bones were atrophied from a lack of use, so he was essentially \"useless\" from the strictly utilitarian side of things.  Near his death in his mid-teens, he also suffered a severe infection of his right lower leg, to the degree that his foot would likely have been gone by the time he died. The infection probably killed him.  Despite these problems, he lasted 15 years. And there is no explanation for that except that he was cared for that entire time by his group."

In some cultures those behaviors may be viewed as a spiritual gift, although that's rarer than the alternative; B) carries a shameful stigma and is therefore often hidden by the sufferer or the family; C) simply not recognized as a mental illness, whether the culture has a concept of mental illness or not. For example someone we might classify as clinically depressed may simply be considered very sad or even lazy by their culture, or someone with anxiety might just be considered a nervous or meek person in general.   I remember when I was living in rural Cambodia (we're talking no running water, thatched houses, collecting rain water to bath out of type rural) I was living with a local family. They had a friend visit who brought their about 12 y/o daughter (I'm not sure exactly TBH, could have been older or younger) who clearly had some disorder like severe tourettes or possibly some variety of schizophrenia, but very obviously in need of serious professional intervention. Anyways, the mother I was staying with pulled me aside and explained that the girl was possessed by demons and had been for several years now, and that they would be praying together later to drive out the evil spirits. It wasn't my place to tell them the girl needed a doctor, since there was absolutely no way they could afford that, the only real hospitals were kilometers away in Phnom Pehn, and even if I they had the money and took her there it's unlikely any doctor there would even have an idea about how to diagnose or treat such a thing."

Especially not if the deposits date to 130Kyr BP in the Mediterranean, which is a time during which we know anatomically modern humans were round in Africa. Given that the earliest anatomically modern human remains are now dated to ca. 300Kyr BP in Morocco, a date less than half that on an island in the Mediterranean could be Neanderthals or modern humans.  The earliest evidence of modern human boat usage (for sure) is the arrival of humans in Australia some 65,000 years ago. Australia could not have been reached without some type of watercraft.  The possibility has also been raised that *Homo erectus* or the ancestors of *Homo floresiensis* might have used logs or other *very* simple means of traveling on the water has been raised by their presence on islands in Indonesia that would have required traversing some amount of open water to reach."

For quite a few years I recommended it to everyone I could find.  Then I happened upon r/askanthropology. Humbled by the ever-patient anthropologists gently, and repeatedly, explaining to  other Jared Diamond devotees that the book I loved was essentially not much better than a conspiracy theory, I resolved to be a bit more careful about what I believed, and to improve my understanding of anthropology through other books.  That process has only just begun, with Charles Mann\u2019s 1491, which I loved (and seems to be much better regarded by proper anthropologists than GGAS \u2026 please don\u2019t burst my bubble a second time r/askanthropology). Still a long way to go.  However, I would like to know exactly how inaccurate GGAS still is, presumably there must be aspects of it that I can still believe. I accept the broad, overarching theory is just too neat and simplistic to explain a complex world, and built on inaccurate assumptions. But a lot of what first captivated me in the book was the build up, more than the conclusion itself, the ruminations on agriculture and technology and why they spread faster in one part of the world than another. Lots of the little details I used to repeat to people as fascinating little factoids, like the idea that Europe\u2019s long history of herd animals meant our diseases were worse than those in the Americas.  What I would like to know, dear anthropologists, if you have the time and patience to humour me, is this - what of Diamond\u2019s evidence base is reliable and broadly accepted, and in what areas does it fall flat? Which interesting factoids can I continue to repeat without further contributing to the public miseducation about anthropology?\n\nAssistant:"

We are doing no such thing. We are saying that the kinds of environmental arguments Diamond uses are a problematic way of addressing racism.\" (bold and italics added for emphasis)  I'm a cultural anthropology PhD student, but I think Diamond is worth considering as the consequences of how we summarize and explain things to general audiences. It's been a long time since I've read Diamond years ago as an undergrad, but the jist that still sits with me is that *why yes, environments do affect the way people and societies in them develop.*   However, I think that it leaves a lot of agency (and culpability!) out of the hands of people themselves.   For instance, Diamond's coda on Japan argues that agriculture didn't \"appear\" until rice crops reached a critical mass of development where they were adapted to the colder, drier climate of the Korean peninsula. That made sense to me as an undergraduate and I even wrote a paper on it. But in my own seminar work as a PhD student, it became apparent that the answer is much more complex - and while environment is a factor, Diamond got some of the details backward and forgot to consider peoples' agency.  *(It wasn't the crops needing to be adapted, but rather local environmental fluctuations and political/civil unrest that was happening around the same time that encouraged people to move and find new places like the more hospital parts of south Japan right across the Tsushima Strait).*  And from a sort of broad, superficial appearance of things (breadth over depth) it makes generalizations that \"look okay.\" But the problem with that is we can't assume that general audiences carry the same big mental asterisk that comes with these generalized assumptions.  So my suggestion would be to approach any of these popular history/social science books the same way we might think about how a topic is taught in 3rd grade, 6th grade, and 12th grade, and college. Diamond's intent to broadly interweave a lot of information and cover a lot of ground is admirable, but the problem is that when you write to a popular audience you can't or forget to qualify your generalizations.   The problem with something like Diamond is that unlike Bill Nye or Mr. Wizard, Diamond isn't just simplifying scientific principles that sound like \"technobabble\" to people. He's minimizing complex socio-cultural actions and their consequences as circumstances of environmental causes. And that erases human agency, colonialism, imperialism, etc.   Don't rely on popular books to be authoritative. Use them as a starting point... Diamond doesn't have a long list of citations, but Wikipedia does. :)"

It seems that a certain kind of mouth bacteria can prime the immune system into attacking joint tissue and causing inflammation around the body.

It seems that for rheumatoid arthritis to develop, you need both the bacteria and the genetic disposition towards this autoimmune response.  The circumstantial evidence is very interesting:  * Before \\~1500, there are no European, Asian, Middle Eastern, or African written medical texts that match rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, with the closest descriptions better matching ankylosing spondylitis or goiter. * Before \\~1500, there are no paintings or statuary in Europe, Africa, or Asia that match rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, like crabbed/curled up hands with swollen joints, even in realistic artistic traditions. * There are no skeletons from archaeological sites older than \\~1500 outside the Americas that show RA symptoms (which affect joints so much they can be seen in the bone), while other skeletal problems like ankylosing spondylitis can be seen. * There ARE skeletons from American pre-Columbian archaeological sites that show RA symptoms. * Whether any non-American skeletons prior to \\~1500 fit rheumatoid arthritis diagnoses is debated, but overall evidence supports the above patterns. * These affected pre-Columbian skeletons are found at the oldest dates in the Tennessee Green Valley area and there is a pattern of RA spreading outwards in the population from that site, consistent with the spread of infectious agent (https://doi.org/10.1016/0049-0172(92)90018-990018-9) paywalled, but can be accessed via Sci-Hub or other methods).

I have found it weird that this is pretty much the exact opposite of the popular media portrayal, but then again I shouldn't be surprised by that any more. Anyway, most of the arguments for intentional burial seem to be of the variety \"I don't see why/how this would have happened otherwise\", but I really do not think that's good enough. Intentional burial is a positive claim, and you need evidence for it.   Gargett (1999) published what I think is a pretty good, albeit incomplete list of criteria that would need to be met to confirm the presence of an intentional Middle Palaeolithic burial. We have no idea if *H. naledi* is from the Middle Palaeolithic or not, but I think the criteria are still applicable.   The questions to answer include: are there new and distinct geological strata indicating burial, are there complete skeletons, are there articulated skeletons, are the skeletal elements preserved relatively equally, are the remains fragmented, what is the position of the skeletons, is there evidence of trampling or other peri/post mortem disturbance, what are the bedrock characteristics of the area, what was the depositional environment, and what other evidence of taphonomic processes is present?  It's certainly possible to argue against some of these criteria, but it's also easy to see that *H. naledi* does not satisfy a lot of them. And this list was developed for Middle Palaeolithic humans and Neanderthals, not an undated species from any time in the past few million years, for which we have no evidence of any cultural development. The proof required in this case should be more stringent, not less, and yet the only argument for intentional burial is \"why would they be there otherwise?\" It's just not good enough.   If the skeletons were articulated, maybe, but they aren't. If they were buried in a consistent pattern, maybe, but they aren't. If there were any other indication of any sort of cultural development, maybe, but there isn't. If we knew when these individuals lived, we'd have a better idea, but we don't.   I understand the appeal, believe me I do, but I can honestly say that I don't know anyone in palaeoanthropology (who wasn't an author on the paper) who would actually argue that they were buried intentionally, myself included. Maybe some new evidence will be published that'll change our minds, but until then I just don't believe it at all. You can even see in /u/Thecna2's post, which did a very good job summing up the popular press arguments for intentional burial, the only real argument is that it's hard to imagine how the remains got there unintentionally.

In other words, Islam is about more than the Qur'an, hadiths, and mosque. Muslims carry their faith with them as they walk out of the mosque and then have the interpret the world around them based upon their religious teachings, ethics, personal relationships, desires, politics, economic situations, etc. Despite attempts by certain groups to recreate the time of the Prophet (or Jesus or any other charismatic leader) the faith group can never actually go back to that. Thus, the life and teachings of the prophet and/or text are always historically situated and must be interpreted for the constantly changing reality of the followers. Religion is not a thing that is static or constant. To talk about it as such is to reify it. Instead, religion is a set of ideas and beliefs that are often based upon texts and prophets/leaders but which by their nature must always adapt to be meaningful to the lives of the people that practice them.   This means that at times people will inevitably disagree about interpretations or ways to apply that faith to the world around them. You can't live the life of the prophet because that world no longer exists. So people have to choose what is still relevant or applicable. They have to interpret larger meanings or intentions of those teachings. Sometimes, practitioners might feel that certain teachings or rules really only applied to that historic context and aren't relevant anymore, while others disagree. Personal desires and politics also come into play and influence how this occurs.   Clifford Geertz's classic example was a Javanese funeral. A young man named Paidjan suddenly died, but due to the deceased\u2019s affiliations with Permai (a political and mysticism movement) the local Muslim leader refused at first to bury him according to traditional Islamic methods. In Java, bodies are usually buried quickly and with iklas, which is the lack of emotional distress, in a communal setting. However, without the option of the traditional method of Islamic burial, the friends and family of the deceased were at a loss for how to treat the dead and became greatly distraught. They were forced to throw together a funeral that lacked the symbols, consensus, and authority typically used for such an event. This is because the social and political climate of Java had changed, where members of the community no longer shared a unified religious belief, but the practical matters of issues such as funerals had not yet adjusted to the change. In sum, the disruption of Paidjan\u2019s funeral may be traced to a single source: \u201can incongruity between the cultural framework of meaning and the patterning of social interaction, an incongruity due to the persistence in an urban environment of a religious symbol system adjusted to peasant social structure\" (1973:169). This incongruity meant the ritual failed to synthesize ethos and worldview.  Geertz uses this Javanese example in an attempt to deal with what happens when culture is not just reinforced in a stagnant manner. He introduces the concept of intellectual systematizers which are individuals who attempt to forge new and more self-conscious systems of cultural meanings in the face of changed social realities. Yet, if alterations to rituals make it a failure, how do intellectual systematizers create new and still successful rites? It is worth asking whether there is ever a ritual where every individual\u2019s personal system of symbols map perfectly onto the collective expression. Almost all rituals contain the possibility for variations that do not disqualify the rite from social acceptance. Would the funeral have been a disaster if the imam had agreed to hold the funeral but added a warning about the political and religious dangers of Permai? Or, if the imam had held the funeral in the traditional Javanese Muslim fashion, would Permai attendees who do not hold Muslim beliefs have ruined the funeral even if they participated appropriately? Most cultures provide a range of acceptable responses to a situation. I suggest that while some cultural shifts do occur through self-conscious action, many also change slowly over time through small adjustments that are not seen as important enough to alter a ritual\u2019s efficacy.   In sum, all religions have to adapt and change in order to remain relevant to the lives of the people who practice them. But those shifts require downplaying certain aspects, emphasizing others, and creating new ones. Over time this means that not only will the religion change from how it was initially practiced but divisions may occur."

A little background, last year I completed my MA in Bio. Anthropology at a university in the Midwest. I graduated Magna Cum Laude and for all intensive purposes looked great on paper. However, my graduate experience has left me with some PTSD. Like most people now I had to work through school to support myself. I worked at the lab I was studying in as a graduate assistant and at a separate place of employment. When I got into the program I was told of the opportunities I would get and do because I had experience. (I was an undergrad at the same university.)   None of what I was sold was ever provided. I was in the lab more often than not, on top of honor society duties, homework and my other job, and when certain things came up, I was denied. Why? The answers went three ways:  1. I was too busy with my other job and no one knew my schedule. Which was a lie because it was a set schedule and every other graduate student in my department knew where I would be to the near minute of the day.  2. I wasn\u2019t as \u201cdedicated\u201d as I should be. Because I would go home for one week of the summer (when nothing was going on or planned as my advisor would also be doing other things.) and for two weeks during the winter holiday (lab was shut down and we literally couldn\u2019t enter the building.)  3. I was unfocused. My advisor made me change my thesis topic not once, not twice but 6 times. This was AFTER, he had approved it, seen my notes and multiple sources as well as the draft for my proposals. All of which he had given the green light until the last minute when I was told it wouldn\u2019t work. Only to have a friend of mine actually do a project based off what I had wanted to do for my thesis after telling me I couldn\u2019t.   This was a constant. I was at the lab more than my own home. I was often told my thoughts were biased based on my ethnic background (Hispanic/white and Apache.) and that I was smart for someone of my background. That they couldn\u2019t believe I passed my comprehensive exams. This all continued to when I was supposed to go collect the necessary data for my thesis. My advisor wouldn\u2019t let me contact the labs, and on several occasions became flat out offended that I would try. Saying it was his job to do so not mine. When telling other grad students this they were confused as they had contacted them and it was all right. I tried and when the lab contacted him to set up a date in which I could go, he told them to cancel my request. So I did as he wanted and  let him. When spring of 2020 came around I was in his office every week asking if he had heard. He told me he had been contacting these labs and no one would return his emails. (Looking back it is bogus but I was extremely tired and worn down, trying to not rock the boat.) Then the week the world shut down in March I was told that a lab had finally answered. I wouldn\u2019t be able to collect data because of the pandemic. I was taken off my thesis track and placed onto a project. That same week I received 10 rejections from PhD programs due to my recommendation letters (which I had told had been sent) never being received. I was devastated as I had always wanted to get my PhD. I love the field and research but that along with everything else in the last two years really took a toll on me. I graduated snd am now in the workforce. Ironically, as my advisor had wanted it because to quote, \u201cYou would be able to have a family and marriage, if you only had a Masters, and did not continue on to a PhD.\u201d.  So, here I am almost a year out from grad school. I look back now and I see the toll it took on me, mentally, emotionally and physically. None of which were good. I did have good experiences in grad school, but if I\u2019m honest I had more in the bad category. Grad school is supposed to be hard, but it shouldn\u2019t be damaging. Which is how I have felt since leaving along with my peers who did with me as well. A part of me still wants my PhD as it was a dream but I don\u2019t know if I can throw myself back into that toxicity. Any thoughts?\n\nAssistant:"

Actually, what *does* matter is that they were of ethnically diverse genotypes, and this can be easily proven. The only thing relevant to the common notion of \"ethnicity\" is the fact that geographically isolated populations will produce higher frequencies of certain alleles over time, but there is never a point at which \"higher frequency\" becomes a \"new group\" because human societies are always intermixing, always trading, always growing in complexity over time."

When using a stand mixer for your ingredients, always mix on LOW. Mixing on low will help prevent your batter from retaining air, making it less likely to crack. I usually use the \"stir\" option on my kitchen aid and never go higher than a 3. Many recipes will say to scrape down the bowl between each addition of ingredients and I cannot stress enough how important that is! Making sure everything is uniform is key to a smooth, flawless cheesecake. 2. After I pour the cheesecake into the springform pan, I hit it on the counter a few times to release any possible air bubbles that may be in the batter. 3. Screw the water bath - I use a roasting pan. I position the two racks in my oven to a middle position and a low position. Thee cheesecake goes on the middle rack, and on the lower rack goes a large roasting pan which I fill 1/2 way to 3/4 of the way with boiling water which I pour into the roasting pan when I put my cheesecake in. This creates a nice steamy environment for the cheesecake without having to wrestle with sheets upon sheets of foil just to end up with a soggy crust from a water bath. 4. DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DURING BAKING! I avoid doing this at all costs as the temperature change can cause cracking. Some people recommend rotating half way through baking but I avoid doing this and have never had any problems with cracking. 5. When your cheesecake is done baking, turn off the oven and leave it alone for 30 minutes. I press the \"off\" button and leave my cheesecake in the oven with the door closed for 30 minutes to start the cooling process. After the 30 minutes is up, crack the oven door and lodge a wooden spoon between the door and the oven so there is slight air flow for further slow cooling. Do this for another 30 minutes. After that 30 minutes is up, you should be good to go. Let your cheesecake sit on the counter for another 30 minutes before placing it in the fridge to cool completely.  These techniques are the ones that work for me, however there is always someone with an opposite approach so take everything I say with a grain of salt as I am no means a professional. It cant hurt to try, though! Best of luck and I hope these tips work for you"

I've recently started stepping into baking my own pie doughs and doing some research yields some really smart useful tips - ie the test kitchen technique of only partial flour then the rest or using vodka/vinegar and the differences between lard or butter - all really dope.   But I've yet to see a lot or even much of anything on flavored doughs - at first I thought maybe some herbs in the flower to punch up some savory pies but then flavoring the butter makes more sense but honestly nothing. It feels so obvious that my internal flags are rising to ask, if it's so obvious but not commonly done, why?   If it just a flavor thing, like, the crust is the base and if your pie is bland then the filling should be the focus not the crust? That one I get but still, why isn't flavored butter used in more recipes when it comes to pastry? Is there a legit technical reason not to?  Hell, I know there's some convo on ghee crusts or shortening butter combos but as someone stepping into pastrys I'm just really curious?

If you want to add herbs or spices, just add them. But do make sure that they are pretty fine otherwise you'll have difficulty keeping the crust together.  Also, yes, in general the crust is meant to provide texture and background for the filling. A beautifully made crust that is perfectly flaky and just baked through really doesn't need anything else."

When the frosting's temperature drops below 69\u00b0F (21\u00b0C), its butter content will stiffen, bit by bit, until the frosting breaks into a curdled mess.  You're whipping up the buttercream while it's in the small goldilocks zone of pliability and ready to take in air from mechanical leavening. Note that fixing a soupy SMBC is a bit like hitting reset, you may need to redo much of the whipping process since the butter melted and did not hold on to leavening. If you have a thermometer, this is straightforward to assess and rectify; if not, you can whip it for as long as necessary once chilled, however long the butter takes to warm up to right temperature and whip up. Might be 3 minutes, might be 20+, that's not the recipes fault, it's just kitchen temperatures being different, heat differential, etc."

Very versatile.  4. Flat sheet trays- cookies, macarons, etc. handy to have extra on hand for big batches of bakes  5. Oven thermometer- just for better oven temp reading. 6. Silicon spatula- get small, medium, and large. Great for cooking stuff like compote, caramel, creme anglaise, pastry cream. The way silicon spatula bends allows better scrapping to prevent burns on the bottom of pan. Not all spatula are made equal, good ones usually has burgandy red handle and white scraper tip. 7. Rolling pins- i prefer just the slab of wood, ive never liked metals with mechanical handles that rotates on its own as they break easily. 8. Hand mixer- if you cant afford a stand mixer, atleast get a hand mixer. Good for heavy duty mixing like meringue, buttercream, frosting, foams. 9. Palette knife aka metal spatula- good for spreading batters, leveling frosting, decorating, etc.  10. Whisk- get a medium and large ones, get ones with thick flexible wires and very wide balloon shapes as that whips and mixes better.  11. Basic piping tips- small round (2mm) for lettering, a medium round, large round, medium star, and large star. Those are the essentials for beginner decorating.  12. Fine mesh strainer or Tamis- for sifting and straining."

A little more extra: soak the cranberries in spiced rum for a day or two, then let them dry a few hours before adding to the dough, caramelize your white chocolate and add in as shards instead of chips, add some chopped pistachios (they're a nice flavor complement to both white chocolate and cranberry plus you get the red/white/green thing)  You could also up it with the presentation a bit. After you portion the balls of dough, split them in half and then press back together with the parts that were inside now on top and then add a few strategic bits of chocolate/cranberry on top before you bake.

The recipe calls for browning the butter, 1 ^(1/2)  Sticks (^(3/4) Cup)  The first time I made it I browned enough butter to have ^(3/4) cup of melted brown butter, which resulted in overly greasy buttery cookies. I did a little googling and found that browned butter should be about ^(3/4) of the original butter since the water has evaporated. So from this I assumed that browning 1 ^(1/2)  Sticks (^(3/4) Cup) butter should result in ^(1/2) cup of browned butter for the final recipe.   Except when I went to brown my butter, I ended up with roughly the same measurement I started out with. I didn't want to end up having the same problem as before so I used about half a cup of the browned butter and the cookies tasted better than the first attempt.   My question is how much butter am I supposed to be using for the recipe after browning, is it the full ^(3/4) of a cup - or the reduced amount of ^(1/2) cup?   And second, why didn't my butter reduce in volume? Did i not cook it long enough for the water to evaporate - even though it had developed a nice amber colour and nutty aroma? I was scared of burning so I assumed it was done, should I have let it cook some more?   &#x200B;  Thanks!\n\nAssistant:"

Are these suitable to substitute in a 1:1 ratio with the original recipe?  This also does not have chopped dates in it, but the others do.  Having never made or eaten this before, how much would it matter having the dates or not?  This one looks very basic and simple to make.  It uses granulated (white) sugar in the sponge instead of a more flavorful brown sugar (or muscovado/treacle), so how much of a difference would that make and would it taste like an authentic dish or not?  This one has the same granulated sugar, but uses golden syrup (or molasses) in the sauce and the previous one does not.  The rest of the recipe is similar to the previous, just in smaller portions for a smaller bake, which would be better for me since I'm the only one eating it anyways.  I know this is typically a European (UK/English?) kind of dish and having never tasted it I don't just don't know how these substitutions or variations will effect the final dish.

It technically stretches about 30 miles from Detroit to Pontiac (all of Woodward Ave.) although the primary \"cruise\" areas are really from about 9 Mile Rd to Long Lake (18 Mile) and then once you get up in to Pontiac it gets very busy again.  The metro-Detroit area has a bit of everything, though, and for the most part nobody cares what it is.  We have old cars with new engines, we have Fords with Chevy engines, we have imports and domestics, etc.  There are certain stigmas attached to each type of car, although I think people do a good job of accepting just about anybody at formal car shows.  Unlike the OP, we get a ton of muscle cars.  Mustang, Camaro, Charger/Challenger, etc.  Those are by far the most popular.  Corvettes are another very common car.  We also have our share of imports.  Honda's have somewhat fallen out of favor, but more because they don't really make anything performance oriented anymore.  We still get a lot of Subaru, BMW and VW.  We get more than a handful of Mercedes.  In my area, with as big as the automotive aftermarket is and with how many enthusiasts there are, we see some more of the unusual side of things, too.  Last weekend I went to a small Cars and Coffee event on Woodward and there was a McLaren MP4-12C, a Morgan 3 Wheeler, a couple of Ferrari's and quite a few other unusual cars.

Tho it\u2019s super discouraging feeling like I\u2019m racing against the clock every time I wait for a car to turn green. And since everyone in an automatic the people next to me at the light start so stinking fast cuz all the gotta do is hit the gas.   Anyone have any tips to where I can still practice driving but not feel like an idiot that can\u2019t go out on the main roads?   Maybe just going out at like 11pm and driving around while there are less cars on the road?   tl;dr: Whenever I\u2019m at a stoplight I\u2019m always the first in line. I feel like I\u2019m against the clock when the light turns green and I end up stalling the car. After that I get it the next try or someone honks at me and that\u2019s my motivation to get out of there.\n\nAssistant:"

My friend was making his 3 hour drive back home yesterday, having borrowed his family's 2008 Honda Pilot, doing about 90 down the highway when the car basically catastrophically fails, accelerator immediately stops functioning, all the warning lights come on, and he pulls over immediately. He gets it towed somewhere and the guy says the timing belt snapped. (Entirely owner error: it's his mom's car and she never got the belt replaced as per routine maintenance guidelines). Like I said, it's a 2008, and I think he said it was 114k miles.   From everything I've read, it sounds like it's almost certain the engine is shot (interference engine and all that). Currently the car is still at that shop. His family knows nothing about cars and is just trying to weigh their options right now.  From my understanding, they can either buy a replacement engine and pay to have it put in (from what I saw online, probably $2-4k for an engine, plus labor). Or they can just sell it. This is where I'm not really sure what the options are. Obviously it can't be sold as a drive-able car. What kind of value would it have as just parts? I can't imagine very much.   Any knowledge, information, advice, recommendations etc is appreciated. It seems like it's gonna be shitty no matter what - but hey, that's why you keep up with routine maintenance.

Hey everyone,  I was hoping you could help me out with a really annoying issue I\u2019ve had in my baking since moving to the Netherlands and getting a new flat, with a new oven.  Since moving here I\u2019ve consistently struggled with the insides of my breads and cakes baking. The outside will brown within the time frame stated by the recipe, but I end up having to leave my bakes in the oven for at least another 15-20 minutes, just to get them past the point of being raw inside. This isn\u2019t specific to any one recipe. My latest list of heartbreaks include (but are not limited to) scones, a chocolate babka loaf and an Irish soda bread - all of which had to stay in the oven for much longer than the recipe said, and even when they eventually seemed ready, they were very moist and doughy in the middle (my babka loaf even collapsed when I cut it).   I know that some Dutch baking products are different to what I\u2019ve been using at home - baking powder is less strong here, and it\u2019s hard to find a good bread flour. But this seems more like an oven temperature issue to me? I bought a cheap oven thermometer which says the oven is 15-20 degrees cooler than it should be, but given that it\u2019s a cheap thermometer and the sugar test I ran said my oven temp was accurate (at least at 375 F), I\u2019m at a loss at what to do.   Do you have any suggestions about a possible culprit? Could my oven be too cool? Or too hot? Would both too-cool and too-hot ovens lead to under-baked insides?

For your thickener, I could see pectin or maybe even a neutral food starch such as corn or potato.  Gelatin might have a weird mouthfeel from the freezer though.

Keep on doing this until you've added about a quarter of the cranberry mix to the eggs. This process is called tempering. Then introduce the cranberry egg mix back to the pan, you guessed it, while whisking the pan with the cranberry mix. Cook to about 170\u00b0f/77\u00b0c, so that the curd coats a spoon and will hold without dripping when you swipe a finger through it. Turn off the heat, whisk the butter in.

I was confused about her cause of death, knowing it was cardiac arrest but what had caused it?  Her toxicology report was completely clean. They found fibrosis on the heart indicative of other heart attacks, at least half a dozen, during the autopsy - but I got a call yesterday saying that she has a genetic mutation.   I don\u2019t know much about this, and now our entire immediate family (me and my parents) must be tested. The mutated gene is PPA2, which lines up right, but the medical examiners aren\u2019t able to give a full cause of death until they test everyone in the immediate family because she has a variant they are not 100% sure about.   I\u2019ve done some research about the PPA2 gene - it seems it\u2019s a big contributor to sudden infant death, but why would it hit my sister when she was 19? The sensitivity to alcohol makes sense, but me as her sister, how much do I have to worry? I drink quite frequently (regrettably) and haven\u2019t had any chest pain, but knowing that we have a genetic mutation in the family has me utterly freaked out - does anybody know anything else about this?   Was there any way we could have caught this before she passed - did she have to take a genetic test?   My sister was 19 and healthy, seemingly. Is it common for somebody of her age to die of a mutation like this? I\u2019m finding endless studies, but no idea how common it is, I want to know as much as possible about this mutation and what it means for my life, and if there are any foundations that support research that I can donate to, or even a program to help educate young people what a heart attack truly felt like, because my sister did not!  Any help is appreciated, and I\u2019ll provide the link to the original post if needed.\n\nAssistant:"

PPA2 is a genetic mutation associated with arythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) and mitochondrial cardiomyopathies. There is an overlap between the two.  The autopsy report you were given supports ARVD. Based on this, your sister DID NOT have multiple heart attacks. Instead, she had a genetic mutation that replaced normal cardiac myocytes with fibrotic tissue. The problem with this is that the normal pathways of conduction become skewed and predisposed her to arrhythmias. I have not seen your original post (I am running into work and wanted to give you this information ASAP). She most likely suffered from a ventricular arrhythmia causing cardiac arrest.   It is extremely important that your entire immediate family get screened for this genetic mutation. Now, even if you have the mutation, you may not have the disease. ARVD has variable penetrance, meaning you can have the mutation but NOT have the disease.  AFTER screening, IF any of your family members are positive for the gene, they need AT MINIMUM an echocardiogram, but should have a cardiac MRI to determine if the disease is present or just the gene. If disease is present, will need a defibrillator.  Again, sorry for the fast response but wanted to give you this info. I am extremely sorry for your loss and all of this stress. Please feel free to DM me with questions or for help interpreting results."

The only way to keep hydrated is by going in to get IV fluids.  I just got back from such a treatment.  *_Note: I define a \"traumatic event\" as an event related to my health of which significant healing is required afterward_  **First traumatic event: the birth of firstborn** This was the first notable time this phenomenon came over me: I birthed at home, the labor lasting about 4 hours total.  During the first hour, I started to vomit and continued to do so during the rest of the birth.  Otherwise, there were no complications during the birth, and my baby was born healthy.  After birth, whenever I would breastfeed, it would trigger a vomit-response, of which I was not able to recover from for about a week.  I finally went into the ER and they gave me IV-fluids and ran checkups to check for leftover placenta (of which there was none).  They also gave me an anti-nausea agent (I forget what it was).  Ironically, I felt more nauseous when they gave it to me, and I threw up.  I would find out about six months later that the apartment I was living in was mold-infested.  I promptly moved out and wrote this occurrence off as being a side-effect of having my overall health compromised.  **Second traumatic event: the birth of firstborn** For my second child, I also birthed at home.  This time, I did not start to vomit until much later in the birth, but it was the same story while breastfeeding: vomiting, of which I was not able to recover from for about a week.  _Side-note: as it is not uncommon to feel nauseous while breastfeeding, at this point I wrote it off as being a weird quirk of mine post-partum.  After a week of recovery, I would still feel nauseous during breastfeeding sessions, but not enough to vomit._  **Third traumatic event: oral surgery** Alright, fast-forward to now: up until now, I have been subject to a recurring cold, on a period of approximately 10 days.  Also, as mentioned above, my left tonsil is perpetually swollen quite large.  I recently had the time/funds to get this looked into.  It was suggested to me by my doctor that my symptoms could be due to two possibilities: 1. Babesiosis, and 2. Cavitations leftover from a wisdom-tooth extraction from 7 years ago.  I went to an oral surgeon in Denver and he ran x-rays, scans, etc., and he not only found cavitations in all four sites, but also leftover roots in my lower-right wisdom-tooth site.  Being the kind of person that would rather pursue creating an environment of healing for my body, and wanting to treat a tonsillectomy as a last resort, I opted for an operation in which said oral surgeon would remove the roots, and fill the cavitations.  The operation was scheduled to occur six-days ago (on Valentine's day no less!), and the operation was completed successfully (with the following oddity: whatever sedative he gave me did not work.  He apparently gave me \"6 times what I give to a grown man\" and I was still aware of everything going on and could even feel portions of the procedure at a level which I could have done without.  This seems to be genetic, as my grandfather and mother both describe the same phenomenon applying to them as well; it sucks).  He had me on 2 Tylenol + 3 Ibuprofen every six hours, but that really irritated my stomach, so I stopped as soon as the pain abated to a manageable level (approx two days after the operation).  Sure enough, two days after the operation, I began to vomit as I had after the births of my two children, and I am currently at the point where I cannot hold any liquids/solids down.  If I sit in a hot bath, it calms me down and I temporarily feel better, but it does not help me keep anything down.  I can typically sneak a few fluids and easy solids in in the morning, but that's it.  This event makes me think that, contrary to me previously believing this phenomenon would only apply after I gave birth, that this might have a wider effect on me than I previously thought.  I am really at a loss.  I know it will eventually pass, but it really sucks as I have to take prolonged time off from regular duties, and I feel just awful.  I would really like to figure out the root cause of what's going on in my body to cause it to respond in this fashion.  If anybody has any clues or pointers for me as I search out a cause, it would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for reading\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " I am not a doctor, but I have some relevant experience.  Nausea and vomiting are very well-known reactions to stress and anxiety because adrenaline and other stress hormones cause nausea and vomiting in some people. Now think of this: stress is not only psychologically-based, it can also originate from bodily stress. Things like lacking sleep, being too cold, being too hot, hearing too much noise, and yes, being in pain can trigger a stress response. That is why some people vomit after being injured, not just because the injury is gross, but because it sends the body in a state of shock. Now the 3 events you mention (giving birth twice and having a big surgery) are all very painful, very stressful and very difficult things to live through. In all honesty, I think it could really be just that. Residual nausea from breastfeeding after the birth of your baby could just be due to a Pavlovian association in your brain between breastfeeding and nausea, that wanes overtime as your mind figures out there\u2019s no reason for you to be nauseated.  I have IBS and GERD and they are triggered mostly by physical stressors, mostly lack of sleep, excess noise and pain (I have chronic pain), on top of usual triggers (overeating, fatty foods, sugar, alcohol, caffeine)."

                "content": "\n\nHuman: Can Anyone Help Me Understand What Happened to my Dad? My 64 year old dad passed away 8 weeks ago from colon cancer.  Everything happened so fast that I am not sure I understand exactly how this happened, and I am hoping someone with more knowledge about cancer can help explain things.  Basically, my dad had never gone for colon cancer screenings (I know this is not good but he was one of those people who do not go to the doctor much). This time last year, in July, he was perfectly healthy except that he had a lot of gas. Not pain or bloating, just gas. Sometimes trapped gas that would go away. We all assumed it was a consequence of getting older or food intolerance, and since he had no other symptoms we never considered it alarming.  In October-November, my dad started getting bad insomnia unrelated to the gas. By December, I noticed he had lost some weight, but he had also stopped eating junk food and started walking every morning so we figured it was a result of this.   In January, he had some constipation on and off and complained of hip pain. He had these symptoms from January until March, on and off. He continued to lose weight, but lived normally and continued to be active, had a normal appetite, etc. Finally, after I begged him for a month to see a doctor, he saw one in mid-March. He had a routine blood test that revealed bad liver counts (elevated ALP) that my doctor said was gallstones. He was scheduled for a non-urgent ultrasound to investigate this.   The ultrasound was at the beginning of April, and this is where everything sped up and with COVID, we were unable to be there with my dad for most appointments. The ultrasound showed his liver was full of masses, and a CT scan the next day showed cancer in the colon. Lungs were clear, hip was clear. Still, he was referred non-urgently for follow-up at a cancer centre, and our doctor said he could possibly have chemo and surgery for the liver. This gave us what proved to be false hope.   However, two weeks later, before he could be seen at the cancer centre, his behaviour got strange - paranoia - and he became too weak to walk. We had him admitted to the ER, and they did another CT scan which showed cancer not only in the liver where the ALP tripled since a few weeks earlier, but in the lungs, both adrenal glands, and two tumors in the brain. The doctors were all shocked at how widespread the cancer was, but said with treatment he would have 6-18 months. He had brain surgery, and was scheduled for follow-up, but his doctors refused to give him chemo or radiation and did nothing to address the liver tumors. He passed away a couple weeks later and less than a month after the masses were found in the liver. We couldn't be in the hospital with him because of COVID but they had promised to let us visit when it was close to the end. But the end came so suddenly that we were not informed until after it happened.  What I want to know is, why did this all happen so quickly? Everything I have read about colon cancer says that even at stage 4 it is slow-growing, and life expectancy can be many months. How could he not have cancer in the lungs or adrenal glands weeks earlier and then suddenly have cancer there? Why did his doctors give up on him so quickly and not immediately help his liver when the ALP was rising so quickly and he was getting swelling from liver failure? Why was he referred non-urgently if the liver was so quickly being destroyed by tumors? Why did they say 6-18 months when he passed in less than one? Why was his decline - weight loss and weakness especially - so quick once he was in the hospital? What was the ultimate cause of death and why was it sudden? Is it common to find colon cancer in such an advanced stage?  Because of COVID, nobody ever followed up with us about how all of this happened so fast and so aggressively. I had done so much research about colon cancer and the many chemotherapies and treatment options, and I am heartbroken and angry that my dad did not get a chance to try a single one when it seems like EVERYONE is given standard chemo and biologics and radiation, even just for palliative care. I really feel like the doctors went from saying it wasn't urgent, to giving up on him, with no in-between. I am so angry we got no chance to fight this, and I am so sad he had to come to terms with his mortality so quickly after being given false hope at longer survival. Why did this all happen like this, and is it common that colon cancer give no symptoms until it is everywhere?\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " One of the unanswered questions in your post for me is, what did your father want? Perhaps he was offered chemotherapy or immunotherapy and declined because he didn't want the side effects.  It's very clear that his disease was rapidly progressive and very aggressive. Did the biopsy show a small cell or neuroendocrine component?   With the widespread nature of his disease he may not have been feeling to be a candidate for systemic therapy. As hard as it is, sometimes the right thing for the patient is to do nothing. Of course, that includes a discussion with the patient regarding all of the options.  Your treatment expectations may have been inappropriately setup by the initial physicians. With numerous liver mets, surgery would have been unlikely. He also probably already had brain mets at presentation, but they didn't image the brain initially because he wasn't having neurologic symptoms.  A couple of things moving forward. You may consider requesting genetic testing for your father. You and any siblings should also meet with a GI doctor to establish at what age you needed to have your first colonoscopy and at what frequency to have them done.  Sorry for your loss. It's especially hard during these times as communication in healthcare has been so fragmented."

                "content": "\n\nHuman: Does my Husband (31) have mental heal issues or is he a jerk?    So I have been having the hardest year of my life with my current husband with whom I have been with for a total of 7 years. We met in our mid twenties and generally had a pretty happy relationship. Things started to go south slowly in mid 2017 with the pressure of getting engaged, planning a wedding and dealing with our difficult and dysfunctional families. In addition we were also starting our careers, living in a HCOL area and generally figuring out adulthood. We are also two very different people who came to blows over many differences and were generally poor with conflict resolution.  We had our lows but would always find a way out and be happy again.  At the start of this year, however, things seem to slowly unravel. My husband suddenly started getting panic attacks this January. Seeing as he was someone who never had anxiety or panic attacks, he was very disturbed by this. He genuinely thought he was dying, and had breakdowns. I took him to the ER, and called the EMTs multiple times at 3 am as he would wake up in a panic saying he was dying. They all cleared him saying he was healthy.  Around March he went to a GP for a checkup who looked at his EKG, read it incorrectly and told him he was dying. Within 30 minutes he called my husband back and said actually he made an error and everything was normal. This seemed to have really spooked my husband to the core. After that for the next few weeks he thought he had heart troubles and would not listen to me as I tried to reason with him.  I finally had him visit a cardiologist who indeed confirmed his heart was fine. We then went back to his GP who said that my husband was suffering from extreme stress and anxiety and needed to be put on medication. She prescribed him 10 mg Lexapro. The Lexapro was a god sent in the sense that it finally erased his panic attacks and shortness of breath. Things seem to finally slowly calm down and go back to normal.  A few weeks on Lexapro I started to notice slight changes in his personality. Suddenly he was colder and more distant. The soft, warm sweetness of his personality was replaced by coldness and anger. Now that his panic attacks and anxiety were gone, suddenly everything else was wrong. He said he hated his job that he previously loved and excelled at. He said he was bored and wanted to quit to join the police academy or start his own business, His family and I cautioned him that he needed to not act suddenly and think things through. Anything we said that wasn't affirmative was met with resistance and anger.  He also started drinking heavily. While my husband has always liked to drink, his daily 2 glasses of wine have now turned into a bottle of wine per night. He also goes out with his friends and gets blasted drunk and parties and bar hops until 2- 3 am in the morning. When I tell him he needs to come home earlier, he gets mean and aggressive and tells me to stop being a fun killer!  Suddenly I am his enemy no.1. He seems to have re-written our entire story where everything about our relationship and marriage is wrong. He hates and resents me for the hurt I have caused him and says he feels trapped and caged. He screams at me, yells at me and has scary episodes. For example, if he comes home at 2 am after bar hopping and I say anything about him staying out too late, he will walk into the kitchen, grab a bottle of wine say he is getting out of here and go lock himself in our car!!  He has also started sexting and chatting and calling with random women from hook up apps. I discovered him receiving nudes from a woman a month ago. When I confronted him about it he screamed at me that he wanted a divorce and ran away to stay with his parents. Another time when I tried to confront him again he screamed at me, took his bottle of wine and locked himself out side in our car. When I tried to go outside and get him to come inside and stalk to me like a normal person, he screamed at me and drove off drunk into the night at 3 am. He did not return home until an hour later.  Recently I discovered that he has been having sex with hookers in hotel rooms. He has recently started not coming home or coming home late after work. He always stays at the office until 3- 4 am and sexts chats and sends nude selfies to random women based on what I have seen on his phone.  If he does come home, he will stay up till 3 am by himself watching a movie and drinking.  Occasionally he will seem to have a moment of clarity, apologize profusely and tell me he doesn't know what he is doing. He gets these extreme rushes of emotions and he cant seem to control himself. The rest of the time when I bring up that something isn't normal he says I am the enemy and he hates me and I need to leave him alone and throws a tantrum and runs away.  I am at my wits end. I do not know what is going on with him. He is an asshole or is he suffering from some mental health issue?  TLDR; My 31 year old husband has been acting increasingly erratic, aggressive, mean and is cheating on me. I don't know what to do as this all seems very out of character.\n\nAssistant:"

Your husband seems to be struggling with mood swings, impulsivity, self-destructive behaviour, and addiction. These symptoms could be indicative of certain mental AND physical illnesses, adverse reactions to Lexapro, or both.   A couple of questions that will be useful to any specialist you might see:  \\- is there any history of mental illnesses in his family?   \\- has he ever struggled with these symptoms before?  \\- has he (or have you) noticed any physical change in the past year?  Personally, I'd see both a psychiatrist and a neurologist, to have a clear assessment of his brain both from a psychological and a functional/physical standpoint."

I don\u2019t know what happened exactly but his actual death was so graphic and traumatizing and now it won\u2019t stop replaying in my head and now I\u2019m just scared and confused.   He woke up at 10:30 that morning with low oxygen levels (80-90), around 11:30-12pm his oxygen levels reached 0% and his whole body turned blue. After a few minutes he started gasping for air and then would let out a whine. I held him through this whole thing because I made a promise that I would not leave his side. He stayed dark blue and was gasping for air every minute or so for hours. He was not on a ventilator so I\u2019m not sure how he survived that long with no oxygen but he did. I was told he was brain dead and that he was not aware of what was happening so that\u2019s what I kept telling myself to get me through this horrible experience.. yet he was opening and closing his eyes when I talked to him and grasping my finger.   But it gets worse.. hours go by of him gasping for air and whining then he starts flat lining for a minute or two at a time and then his pulse jumps back up to 90-100bpm on his own. Then he would make awful choking sounds with each breath, the nurse said it was a death rattle. By this time I can see he has sweat around his mouth and his eyes went opposite directions and his tongue was sticking out. Around 8pm it gets worse and by this time his lips and nose are dark purple and the whites of his eyes were turning a red color like blood vessels may have popped. I was terrified and I couldn\u2019t handle seeing him like that but I didn\u2019t want to leave my baby so I stayed..   at 8:40pm all of a sudden his body curls up like he was trying to sit up then he opened his eyes, looked right at me, let out a cry and his whole body turned dark purple almost black. He looked like he was choking for a second then blood and yellowish liquid just poured from his nose and mouth until he stopped breathing. It was a lot of blood but I was told that\u2019s from low WBC count. I ran out of the room screaming for someone to help him but because he had a disease he was a DNR. He suffered for hours and when he looked right at me I felt like he was looking at me helplessly and I couldn\u2019t help him\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I feel terrible and I can\u2019t believe my baby had to go through that\ud83d\ude2d was he alive through all of that? Why did that happen to him? I\u2019m not sure if a tumor ruptured or why he just stopped breathing all of a sudden? I couldn\u2019t look at my son after that experience and I regret it but now I\u2019m afraid to view his body before cremation because I\u2019m scared he will look worse than my last memory of him. I was under the impression that death was going to be like going to sleep and not waking up, nobody prepared me for what actually happened. They won\u2019t do an autopsy either because he was diagnosed with cancer so now I\u2019m left wondering why all of that happened. He seemed fine before that when when I laid him down at 5am.\n\nAssistant:"

I have presided over the deaths of countless children, sadly. People have this view of death as \u201cslipping quietly away,\u201d but children have incredibly resilient bodies and their struggle to maintain life functions at the end can be much longer and more violent. If there is any good news, it is that your son was almost certainly not aware of what was happening, or consciously feeling any pain. You were witnessing some very deep, automatic brain functions going through the process of shutting down - functions that only turn on when consciousness has already failed. This is often more traumatic for witnesses than it is for the child. By allowing him to go through that process naturally and without artificial prolongation, you were actually choosing to bear that trauma and pain so he wouldn\u2019t have to - an act of extreme love and devotion to your son. The fact that it hurts so much is only a testament to how much you cared for him. I do hope you will see a counselor to help you process your grief, they can he tremendously helpful. And I know you will lose a great deal of sleep over his loss. But hopefully you can rest a little easier knowing that he was not suffering excessively at the end."

I put a post on here previously asking advice about my condition, and I got loads of helpful replies- well since January I have lost an alarming 42lbs, I am getting new pains which have started in my upper back, my shoulders, under my ribs in my ?lungs, also pain when I breathe in, also important for this, I had a seizure last month whilst I was out with my friend, I had 2 glasses of wine and went into a seizure and was unresponsive for a few hours in the hospital, they said my blood results were very bad but didn\u2019t explain how, said I could have been extremely ?intoxicated, another doctor said it could have been a ?hypo seizure, but I\u2019m not diabetic, I was also vomiting coffee grounds whilst I was unconscious. My condition has worsened to the point where whatever I am eating whether it\u2019s plain food or not I am vomiting up with reflux, I only eat every 2/3 days as I feel I\u2019m developing PTSD from eating, I\u2019m physically scared of the pain and vomiting.. I am getting so low and depressed from what\u2019s going on I\u2019ve thought about suicide.  I had an endoscopy(without the camera) down to test how strong my oesophagus was, I had a barium swallow aswell which both showed up perfect, But I also had an oesophageal pH monitoring test done which is to be kept in for 24hours and you get given a diary and a monitor you\u2019re attached too, which you can record your symptoms in e.g whenever you feel pain, whenever you eat, whenever you lay down and sleep etc; I ended up becoming severely ill when I had this in and had to rip it out after 17 hours as I was projectile vomiting everywhere and in absolute agony. I had my results back from this test which showed I *DO* have some reflux, but I wasn\u2019t experiencing reflux when I was vomiting, or the pain I was recording wasn\u2019t showing as reflux either..? My doctor has said to me that because of this, if I was to be referred to the surgeons they could reject me as it\u2019s not solid evidence of this being reflux and being treatable from surgery which I\u2019m so upset about... My doctor has now referred me for another endoscopy camera to go down with biopsy\u2019s (I had an endoscopy 6 years ago which showed nothing) to hope they can see evidence of what\u2019s going on.. but this won\u2019t happen for a while now because they\u2019ve stopped all surgeries and endoscopys during COVID unless it\u2019s an emergency, and there\u2019s a long waiting list... the doctor said to me I would have to become severely underweight or unwell in order for me to become an emergency...  I am beginning to lose the will to live, every day life is a struggle, I have started to vomit red blood, sometimes coffee grounds but not in large quantities, I have headaches, I\u2019m in agony every day now, I am losing 1-2 pound per day depending.  My symptoms start as Sulphur burps, then I get upper abdomen pain, then chest pain going into my back and shoulders, then I will get gassy, frequent loose stool, which I will be rolling around screaming and crying from the pain and projectile vomit everywhere; and the smell of my vomit is more extreme than normal vomit, boyfriend describes it as battery acid with rotten eggs. Have been admitted to hospital multiple times when this happens, and every time I have hypertension.  I\u2019m desperate for answers, please if anyone has any solutions or maybe answers to what\u2019s going on with me? Any tests that I could ask to have? Or any knowledge of what could be happening with me or conditions, it would help so much, me and my family are worried sick and feel I\u2019m slipping through the cracks.  ** I have had a camera endoscopy 5 years ago which showed nothing but they want to repeat this test now.

My stool has been pale clay color and very smelly. I\u2019ve had zinc deficiency and vitamin d deficiency and my liver enzymes have been messed up. I\u2019ve been to gastric docs and they haven\u2019t helped one iota. When I was anorexic I avoided fat completely .\n\nAssistant:"

This occurs typically due to problems with either the gallbladder or pancreas. Vitamin D requires fat to be absorbed and is frequently low in those with fat malabsorption which may explain your result  Rapid weight loss and \u2018yo-yo\u2019 dieting are known to increase the risk of developing gallstones; I wonder if this could be the problem given your history of eating difficulties. If a gallstone is blocking your bile duct, this can cause elevated liver enzymes and fat malabsorption as bile cannot flow through. Have you noticed any yellowing of your skin/eyes? Have you noticed any unusual skin itching?   Ultimately we can give you an idea of what could be wrong, but please go see a doctor (probably a gastroenterologist) so you can have a full work up and access the correct treatment."

He made it and is still alive and in good spirits 6 days later. Can someone help me understand? Hi all. My father in law has been sick recently and was sent home on hospice. He has diabetes and about a month ago had a leg amputated above the knee. He has osteomyelitis, pneumonia, MDRO, UTI, and 50% injection rate after a mild heart attack (2 months ago). Last week he was transferred to the ICU from a rehab facility. He was on a ventilator and receiving dialysis daily. He was on a few blood pressure medications and 2-3 antibiotics for his multiple infections. They told us that the prognosis was not good and recommended hospice. Our goal was to get him home to pass with family surrounding him. They doctors had told us that they tried to take him off of the vent the day before and he couldn\u2019t tolerate it longer than an hour. They were saying that there was a good chance that he would not be able to make it through the transport home because he couldn\u2019t be transported without the vent. So on Friday they took him off of the vent and he made it home. Once home they took him off of IV Levophed. They were expecting him to pass shortly after. However this didn\u2019t happen.   Now, 6 days later, he is still alive and in good spirits. He has refused any pain medication and says he doesn\u2019t have any pain. His lungs still sound really bad and he\u2019s requiring frequent suction because he\u2019s coughing up a lot. His o2 saturation has been in the upper 90s. His BP and heart rate are low (couldn\u2019t give you exact readings).   I\u2019m just confused about all of this. They weren\u2019t expecting him to even make it home. He made it and he\u2019s still alive 6 days later. I understand that he is most likely going to pass soon. I\u2019m not in denial about that. I\u2019m just confused as to why he has lasted this long. He was requiring dialysis daily. I figured after a few days he would have passed. I feel almost guilty like we should have waited before making the choice to take him home on hospice. I feel like he might have had a chance for even a slight improvement to give him more time. I guess what I\u2019m trying to understand is, they told us he was in critical condition and was going to die very very soon, as in most likely the same day he gets home. Is the fact that he\u2019s still alive indicative of any improvement or proof that he wasn\u2019t as sick as they thought he was? This has all thrown us on a rollercoaster of emotions and I think the guilt is setting in for all of us.\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " I'm a hospice nurse.  We see these kinds of situations all the time.  The criteria to qualify for hospice is not that the patient is expected to die immediately (and, frankly, at that point it really defeats the purpose of hospice), but that, if the patient's disease runs it's expected course, the patient likely has 6 months or less left to live. It doesn't mean that the patient will definitely die in six months, but it's based on the referring physician's medical judgment.   Patients come home on hospice and the idea is that we try to make the most of the time they have left, as well as managing any symptoms they have.  Oftentimes, a patient's routine medications that are not helping symptom-wise are discontinued.  Many times, patients feel better after stopping some meds that can have uncomfortable side effects.  We also work with a hospice pharmacist to treat symptoms and the medications we use can greatly improve a patient's overall well-being. Sometimes patients feel better just getting out of the hospital and being at home with family.    We currently have some patients who have been on hospice for more than a year.  We've had patients in the past who have done so well that they've been discharged from hospice.    It sounds to me like your situation is one where the medical team had determined there really isn't anything more they can do to try treat/cure the underlying illness so they recommended that he go home and be made as comfortable as possible. Of course, specific questions should be directed to the treating physicians but your hospice nurses are also a good resource for answers as to what his current condition is.   I'm sorry your family is going through this. I encourage you to talk to the hospice team, they will be working to make the most of the time your loved one has left."

Results Were Surprising    Age: 31  Sex: M  Height: 6'6\"  Weight: 250 Athletic  Race: White/Caucasian  Duration: 4 1/2 Months  Location: Lungs/Upper Respiratory, Upper G/I  Current Diagnosis: **Stage 4 Aggressive Gastro-Intestinal Cancer**  Current Meds: Pain Killers, Diuretics  As needed Meds: Lidocaine Patches, Anti-Nausea,  M**elatonin** sleep aid  Original:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/c2ls61/chronic\\_cough\\_and\\_now\\_coughing\\_up\\_blood\\_after/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&utm\\_source=share   So after spending some time at an Urgent Care, getting some scans lined up and trying to be patient, I woke up one morning to pain and compression over my chest. Urgent Care Docs had advised me that any escalation of symptoms should mean I go to the Emergency Room. Once there they almost immediately checked me into the ICU for observation and began running every test you could name. For the next 4/5 days I did just an unreal number of scans, 2 biopsies, and they drew enough blood to fill a small pool. Pain escalated daily while there so finding a solution was a running theme. So after a lot of trails here's what they found:  Current: Stage 4 Aggressive Metastatic Gastrointestinal Cancer ( Adenocarcinoma )  Previous: Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation   After doing a Lymph Node & Bone Marrow Biopsy they found my marrow filled to capacity with dead cancer cells. This pointed them in the right direction. My platelets were crashing daily (20,000 at admission) and I've got inflamed lymph nodes throughout my chest cavity which is one source of my (significant and at time escalating) pain. Its infiltrated my lungs and several vertebrae along my spine (causing vertebrae to show signs of Osteopenia) . Weirdly enough there's no noticeable tumor/mass/lump they can trace it back to. It's kind of just spread throughout (described as Adenocarcinoma) , though they were finally able to locate a small ulcer in my stomach that allowed them to finally be able to classify it. I've currently just completed my 3rd (now weekly) round of chemo (we started asap when other options such as clinical trials were deemed a non-option) and we've been able to stabilize a number of things (blood factors such as platelets, hemoglobin and the like) along the way. Many of my blood counts are still in the trash so clinical trails are not currently an option. In early stages of my 3 weeks hospital visit I was in a state called **DIC (**Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) which caused me to act like something akin to a blood squirt gun if i bled. Essentialy it screws with you clotting factors and any bleeding event is an issue. Any procedure became an issue and many my numbers were artifically raised in order to attempt anything that would cause me to bleed. Fortunately after a week of treatments and what felt like several wheel barrows of infusions we kicked my body out of D.I.C and am more or less clotting normally. Fun story: early one morning after the vampires took their daily does of my blood a CNA came in to do a routine vitals check. This particular morning they took 2 unique sets of blood samples plus a rather large sample for testing against infectious disease. This was also kind of at the height of my \"he's not clotting\" phase. During the blood pressure check it popped open all the fresh holes in my arm, causing them to bleed and freaked/surprised the CNA. Made me laugh. (end of story).  Immunotherapy is what my Oncologist are banking on right now so crossing my fingers. Chemo is causing reasonable progress (numbers are low but stable) so we're staying the course for now. My personal mid->long term goal is to find an alternative to opiates for pain management (who the hell knows why a person tolerates opiates for a buzz cause constipation sucks!!!) so looking at alternatives (THC pills potentially or preferably resolving the issue that's causing me pain)  I've been discharged from the hospital after 3 weeks so now I'm working to find a routine that works. Losing weight so a short term goal is stopping that (I'm rather tall and (was) muscular so my bodies nuking whatever calories I put in and I'm not putting in a lot due to general nausea, but smoothies have been my friend. Please let me know if you have any questions or advice.. I'll answer what I can and absorb what reasonable advice I read.\n\nAssistant:"

My mom was admitted to the hospital almost a month ago for low oxygen levels due to covid. She\u2019s 51 and was diagnosed with colorectal cancer this past August. The doctors successfully removed the cancer but she was still going to chemo to reduce her chances of it returning.   The covid has really attacked her lungs. She has been on the ventilator for about two weeks now maybe a little longer and the doctors have her on 100% oxygen. When she\u2019s in the prone position she can often get up to 95% oxygen but once they flip her it reaches to low 70s. She\u2019s currently on three sedation medications and sedated 100% they\u2019ve even had to paralyze her in order to see if it would help with her oxygen saturation but it isn\u2019t working. She is in need of a tracheostomy but in order for that to happen she must be able to be weaned off of the oxygen they\u2019re giving her to at least 60% but everytime they try to wean her she struggles to get air. Her lungs are stiff and she even had both of them collapse at one point.   We are trying to keep the faith the best we can but it\u2019s just so scary. Please if you can keep her in your prayers \u2665\ufe0f\n\nAssistant:"

So do not give up hope just yet. But the road to recovery for your mom will be long and arduous. The previous cancer is not that big of a risk factor, so if she was otherwise healthy, she has a real chance of survival and recovery at her age. Hope this helps."

She later had a small blood clot removed from her brain surgically with no complications 3 years ago.   On the 25th of May when she was 33 weeks pregnant with our fourth child, she began experiencing symptoms that were similar to those of her first stroke with intense headache, numbness and had a small seizure. I took her to the emergency department and it was determined that she had a blood clot that needed to be operated on and that they needed to deliver the baby. They delivered the baby and transferred my wife to a different hospital where her clot could be surgically treated. The day before surgery she seemed normal. She was complaining of pain and numbness but seemed like herself still. She was smiling, making jokes and ordering me to go back to be with our baby rather than stay with her. On the 27th of May she underwent the surgery. During the surgery the aneurysm ruptured. It was a lot bigger than they previously thought.  Currently, my wife is in ICU on life support. Her doctors say that most likely she won\u2019t survive and that if she does the effects will be devastating and she won\u2019t be the same.   The chances of her surviving her first stroke were only 40% and the chances of having almost no side effects were less than 1% and she came through. She came through the second surgery with ease too. I guess what I\u2019m asking is if there\u2019s a chance that this could be wrong or that her brain could heal itself. I saw the MRI and I understand how serious it is, a large portion of her brain was decimated by the rupture, but I want to know if there\u2019s any chance at all that she could recover from this. Can the brain heal itself from an aneurysm? I\u2019m not ready to say goodbye to her. She\u2019s so young and our kids are all under 7.\n\nAssistant:"

She isn't likely to have an independently-existing aneurysm which just so happened to rupture in the context of all of this. It's quite rare for 30-year-olds to have that problem anyway. The extent of injury from the bleed sounds severe, and it is impossible to say more without additional details and the images of the CT scans or MRI scans, but she is young and could recover, albeit with deficits ...

If you can see what is obstructing the airway, lay the person down, arms to the sides, and sweep it out with a finger. First response should be the Heimlich maneuver.   To do this place your hands around the person in a ball shape at the stomach. When you push into their stomach, be sure to move the direction of your fist in a curved upward motion. If the person is too large that you cannot reach around properly, do this same motion at the chest. The same should be done if the person is pregnant.   If they become unresponsive, unable to breathe or unable to breathe normally, perform CPR. Go to their side, check their pulse at the neck on your side, if no pulse is found within 10 seconds, begin CPR immediately.   To perform CPR correctly, place your hands, one on top of each other, on the breastbone. Square yourself over the body, use the heel of your hand to press down 2\u201d for any person over 8 years old. Try to keep the most even rhythms possible, repeating compressions at a pace of 100 to 120 per minute. Make sure the chest rises back up before pressing back down.   If the person is an infant, cradle them on your forearm facedown, use the hand to support the head and a leg hanging to each side of your forearm. Have the head slightly lower than the rest of the body. Deliver five back blows to the infant using the heel of your hand in the upper back area between the shoulder blades. If the infant doesn\u2019t spit out the obstruction, sandwich your other hand over the child and flip. Perform chest thrusts between the nipples with two fingers. Only go 1.5\u201d deep for an infant. Make sure the chest rises back up before pressing back down. Do five thrusts before flipping back over for back blows.   Obviously this is ideally performed by someone certified but if you cannot have official training, try to best familiarize yourself with these procedures.

Hello,  I'm a hobbyist and have been trying to come up with something mostly silly lately, which despite believing at first that it'd be easy... was not quite so easy.      To elaborate,  Imagine a Pipe, now due to the fact that I can 3D Print this project it doesn't have to be a regular pipe. It can be square, and can even have inside features of basically any complexity. Along the bottom of the pipe are holes that are spaced linearly and straight from one end of the pipe to the other. I started out by spacing them out evenly but eventually came to the conclusion that the spacing might need to be different between each hole.   With this pipe in mind, basically like that of a green house watering system, how to best design the inside of the pipe and the distance between the pipe, or even the diameter of the holes, such that when inputting liquid ( such as water ) through it, that it flows evenly through each and every hole? Obviously in the case of a Greenhouse watering system, the water is generally shot through it with quite a pressure, so despite the pipe design being very simple there, it reaches all the holes. However if liquid were not to flow at high pressure, it would simply take the path of least resistance which usually would be the first hole.  I've tried to come up with some ideas of how to make the path of least resistance be the furthest back by adding complex channels within the pipe, but to no avail. So I was wondering... surely there is already something akin to this out there?  I've been looking for similar designs for a while now but to no avail. So I was hoping to maybe find an answer here.  As for the reason of this project? Nothing particular, I was just randomly interested in fluid oriented design and wanted to try and see how fluid behaves within a pipe and tried to make fluids of different viscosities and with varying pressure leave the above described pipe's holes evenly.   &#x200B;  Thank you for your time.\n\nAssistant:"

You\u2019d get better efficiency from fuel to wheel or from battery to wheel using a purely ICE power train or purely a Battery Electric power train and at much reduced complexity.   This is how a volt works, but this is an interim solution for when battery cost was still too high for purely battery electric vehicle.

The experienced engineer does not need handholding. The experienced engineer needs to be given a problem (or allowed to find the problem), a timeline, and a budget. They can probably take care of the rest.  An inexperienced engineer needs more help, but this help can be in different ways. It's a classic engineering thing to be proud about throwing new people off of the deep end. This is incredibly inefficient, but it \"puts hair on your chest,\" so it continues.  A good manager has engineering understanding but resists the temptation to work the problem themselves. This is where a lot of experienced-engineers-turned-managers get into trouble. The temptation is awful to sit down and work the problem. As a manager, your job is to take care of the non-engineering problems to let your reports work the problem.  And that is not even getting into the human side of management: having your reports' backs, taking on enough but not too much and not too little work, not micro-managing, actually listening to and accepting feedback, and having tough conversations at times."

I have a ton of questions, and those \u201cask an expert\u201d websites seem to be dead so here I am.   TLDR;;; looking to create or find a non porous, non toxic soft material for a fleshlight. I don\u2019t understand what makes up \u202asilicone and how to learn more.    OK so from the information I\u2019ve read, the less porous the material is the softer it is, but non porous means it can be cleaned properly/no bacteria growth.\u202c So obviously I\u2019m looking for a material that is low on the shore a hardness scale but is still non porous. Phthalate is apparently bad because that is the cause of chemical burns with sex toys, but this is what would make the silicone soft?   I don\u2019t know which compounds that make up silicone that influence porosity, softness, heat retention and elasticity, durability etc etc. How does the curing method effect the silicone? I don\u2019t understand what it is I need to create a silicone soft enough for a masturbator cup. Is \u201cmedical grade\u201d and \u201cfood grade\u201d silicones just that because the structure of them is less porous? Could the same type of silicone that breast implants use work - and how would I even know how to convey the exact type of silicone formula I want to a factory? I assume the harder silicon that holds the liquid of a breast implant could be used as a coat layer in a masturbation cup, over a softer silicone material that would be toxic with direct contact. What\u2019s the formula of breast implants silicone? How would I learn if it would would be durable enough to hold, and not deteriorate when constantly rubbed? How would a know how durable a type of rubber would be if thinly spread?  But then I see there\u2019s other options like TPE/TPR. It has a low durometer, and the lower the durometer the softer the material...how is this different from the shore scale? I read \u201cTPE is generally considered body safe\u201d - generally, so not always? How can I learn what kinds of silicone are \u201cmedical grade\u201d or are platinum cured and how do they differ? How would I be able to communicate this to a factory and check if it\u2019s \u201cgood quality\u201d?  I have a lot of questions and idk how to find answers to any of this, Google isn\u2019t exactly giving me answers that are referenced from real sources so I\u2019m just ????? I could use what\u2019s already been used for sex toys, but I want to understand if I can make my own product better.\n\nAssistant:"

Long story short, like probably everyone else, I always really wanted to go into design or R&D. 6 years of experience later, I\u2019ve had one \u201cdesign\u201d job that was a glorified drafting job that lasted about 3 years. The other years were spent in roles that did not at all turn out to be what I thought they were going to be. A mix of pure paperwork and manufacturing-esque work, things I have zero interest in.   I was laid off because of covid last year and I\u2019ve since spent a year unemployed, mostly out of my choosing because I was so burnt out, depressed, and disillusioned with engineering. I\u2019ve gotten an offer to return to the last place I worked (different group) but again doing something I do not want to do at all. The company bait and switched me. Job description sounded amazing and exactly like what I wanted but then when I was asking the managers about the work itself, it was immediately clear it did not match the description at all. It\u2019s again more manufacturing bullshit I don\u2019t want to touch with a 10ft pole.   I\u2019m out of unemployment at this point but I still have quite a bit of savings so I don\u2019t *really* the need job quite yet but obviously income and benefits would be nice. I\u2019m just terrified what might happen to my mental health walking back into an environment I know I\u2019m not going to like.   At this point, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m qualified for the jobs I want. I don\u2019t hear anything back from applications to design roles and I stumble hard in interviews when asked about things I\u2019ve designed. I don\u2019t have any good experience to fall back on in that area. I\u2019ve considered grad school off and on for years but I don\u2019t think I can swing essentially having no income for at least 2 years in a masters program.   I apologize for how whiny this post sounds. I\u2019m just at my wits end trying to figure out ways of putting the train back on the tracks. I\u2019ve even thought about leaving engineering entirely too. That\u2019s how little desire to work in anything manufacturing I have. I have several friends pushing me towards software engineering but god that\u2019s a daunting task lol.   If I wanted to keep pushing for a true design role, is there anything I could be doing in my free time to make my resume more appealing? I\u2019ve found some interesting courses online but I question how much employers really care about that sort of thing. Personal projects don\u2019t seem as relevant in traditional engineering like they are in software. Should I be applying to entry level design roles?\n\nAssistant:"

Thoughts like this culminated in popsci movies like \"I, Robot\" and games like Crysis.  Yet some time after that, it lost all it's hype and we don't hear much about robots nowadays(except Boston Dynamics) and our waiters, garbage collectors, nurses, plumbers or electricians are nowhere to go, soldiers don't wear exoskeletons or fight side-by-side with android combat robots either.

Also, it's way harder to control the environment a robot is in outside of industry - not only does this result in a lot of difficult edge cases you need to design for, it also brings up questions of liability and ethics.   If you're willing to stretch the definition of a robot, the consumer robotics field hat I'd say has made the most progress is cars. A base-model commuter car has a host of sensors that were only available 10 years ago to luxury models, if at all.

Many times, we would select multiple people of the same list. So even if you don\u2019t get the job initially, you may get selected a few weeks down the road. After two years, you will be Competitive for \u201cinside advertised\u201d positions that non-government employees do not see.   PM me if you have further questions about the Corps of Engineers  Edit: Getting the in person interview Is critical. If you make a good impression there, many times you will be asked to apply for an alternate position if you interview well and are a non-select."

                "content": " Ok, so let me say, the history of the tattoo, while explored in various contexts \u2013 especially non-European ones apparently \u2013 hasn't been really well explored for Nazi Germany. However, what little scholarship there is, suggest something that is not very surprising: The Nazis weren't fans of tattoos except those that fulfilled a clear functionality like the SS blood type tattoos or the camp tattoos.  It seems there have been at least local laws in Germany heavily regulating tattoos or more specifically the public showing of tattoos since before the Nazis. The literature often mentions a 1911 prohibition of \"fully tattooed women in public\" though I could not verify if that was a local or national law. What little information there is, seems to suggest that it was local since there is at least one case of a woman in Berlin being escorted out of a bar because of her tattoos. That was Maria Finke, wife of Kuddi Finke, one of Germany's first prominent tattoo artists, who had tattooed his wife on her whole body.  Throughout the 1920s both tattooing as well as showing tattoos (a source of income for circus performers of the \"freak show\" variety) seems to have become more and more regulated in Germany. The most famous example of this is the Bracht'sche Erlass (Bracht's Decree) of 1932 in Prussia. Franz Bracht was the vice-Reichcommissar and commissar of the interior in Prussia after chancellor von Papen had effectively dissolved the SPD lead Prussian government in the so-called Preussenschlag and transferred its powers to the Reich government.  Bracht did many things during his time, both as vice commissar and later minister of the interior under Schleicher but one of them was to completely outlaw the showing of tattoos in public; a practice adopted shortly after in all of Germany, meaning that no one could show their tattoos in public and people could especially not earn a living from that.  This practice continued under the Nazis. Stephan Oettermann, a German cultural historian, mentions in his book *Zeichen auf der Haut. Die Geschichte der T\u00e4towierung in Europa.* (Signs on Skin. A History of Tattoos in Europe) that the Nazis indeed outlawed both showing tattoos in public as well as tattooing itself and that having a tattoo was reason enough to get a person arrested and send to a concentration camp. While I couldn't wholly verify this information (the footnote Oettermann gives is a German book from the 70s I do not have access to atm), I could verify that in 1938 when the police initiated the \"Aktion Arbeitsscheu Reich\" (Action Work Shy Reich) during which people whom the Nazis called \"asocial\" were arrested in large numbers, one directive for the police about who to arrest reads:  > The police has to take action against all forms of showmanship, especially the kind that violates the healthy people's feelings (gesundes volksempfinden). This includes but is not is not limited to showmen of abnormal body (fish men, bird men, animal men and so forth but also tattoos. (...) If bodily health of those individuals allows they are to be brought to a mental facility.  Furthermore, what I could also verify is the fact that several well-known German tattoo artists were imprisoned in concentration camps, namely Wilhelm \"Willi\" E. Blumberg and Albert Heinze, two of the first professional tattoo artists in Germany. They too were swept up in \"anti-social\" actions though it is likely that the Nazis saw additional reasons to them being tattooed for such an action.  Traditionally, tattoos at that point in time were associated with either people whom the Nazis deemed anti-social or criminal (like actual criminals as well as people of low socio-economomic stratas) and sailors but on the latter group I could unfortunately not find much pertinent information.  Two exceptions were apparently made where tattoos fulfilled a practical function: Waffen-SS soldiers had bloodgroup tattoos and, of course, Auschwitz prisoners had their numbers tattooed. With Waffen-SS soldiers little information survives on how this practice started but the function was pretty obvious: To make medical aid easier. Oettermann tells of SS officers getting other tattoos as well but again, this is information I could not verify.   In the camps, the practice started once in 1941 some camps and in particular Auschwitz had a large influx of former Soviet POWs. Originally, the prisoner numbers were sewn into clothing but when the appeareance of these groups lead to a lack of clothing, the practice of tattooing them started. This method was only applied in Auschwitz though while other camps issued badges.  All in all, the Nazis most likely associated with tattoos with so-called \"asocials\" and took active steps to persecute tattoo artists and those who earned a living through showing their tattoos. It is a likely guess that people with tattoos were not regarded too highly by them.  Sources:  * Stephan Oettermann: Zeichen auf der Haut.

The \"star\" of the documentary is Graham Hancock who has been writing about an 'alternative' history of human civilization since the 90s. Most notably, his book \"Fingerprints of the Gods\" put forward the hypothesis that there was a civilization on earth that predated our own recorded history by about 10,000 years. The primary source of evidence for the time-frame came from a theory put forward by another author Robert Bauval in a book called the \"Orion Mystery\" that posited the pyramids of Giza were built to mimic the position of the stars in Orion's belt.  There is a complicated argument involving Ancient Egyptian religion, the shafts in the Great Pyramid and the precession of the stars over millennia that leads to the conclusion that the design of the Egyptian monuments were intended to mark a specific period of time, approximately 13,000 years ago.  Taken at face value, it makes for a compelling story, but even Bauval himself admitted in a later book, that he had to fudge some things to make it all work out (while still clinging to the theory).  Hancock's book has a laundry list of other pieces of 'evidence' that amount to unrelated 'mysteries' or oddities from around the world often drawn from other works. Notably, those other works are exclusively popular publications not scientific ones.  Hancock eventually settles on the 'Atlantis' myth as being the pre-existing civilization; however, while the common understanding of Atlantis is an island that was in the Mediterranean, he draws his theory of Atlantis from a theory put forward by Rand and Rose Flem-ath in a 1995 book called \"When the Sky Fell: In Search of Atlantis\".  The Flem-ath's believed that the historical Atlantis was not an island in the Mediterranean but rather the continent of Antarctica, in part based on the work of Charles Hapgood, a keen Atlantis researcher. There was evidence at the time from core-samples that Antarctica used to have a temperate climate (which has been since well established: cf. this article for example) and that supported Charles Hapgood's Theory of Earth Crust Displacement published in his 1958 book \"The Earth's Shifting Crust\" (which included a supporting forward by Albert Einstein) and which he and the Flem-Ath's accounted for Antarctica/Atlantis's shift to the pole as well as the myth of its disappearance.  The time period in which Hapgood believed Antarctica still had a temperate climate roughly coincides with the time frame that Bauval and Hancock pinned the the existence of their antediluvian civilization; that however, has been disproven (for example: Ingolfsson, O. (2004) Quaternary glacial and climate history of Antarctica.)  All of these authors, Hapgood, the Flem-Aths, Bauval and Hancock have assembled a compelling story that certainly captures the imagination\u2014allusions to their theories show up in popular culture, for example in the 'Stargate' franchise. And although, superficially it appears that they have scientific evidence to support their claims much of that evidence doesn't hold up to scrutiny or more often, is only used to insinuate a conclusion rather than support it. Their work certainly does not constitute anything like scientific rigor and it shouldn't be considered anything more generous than a fun thought experiment. You do not need to dig very deeply before you find their connections to and inspiration from the likes of occult writer Colin Wilson and out-right fraudster Erich von D\u00e4niken who have made outlandish claims concerning ancient civilizations.  Hancock, in particular, as one of the most well-known of proponents of this grand theory of the existence of a prehistorical civilization, has a very poor reputation amongst scientists and historians. He's also notable for his laughable (and disproven) claims about the 'face on Mars' and its supposed connection to the Sphinx."

However, being an Asian American male, I still find Asian accents unattractive - in general the morphemes sound more \"crass\" and \"rough,\" almost comical, as opposed to British/French accents which sound polished or aristocratic. Speaking purely empirically, I've heard people say \"wow that British accent is so hot\" but never the same for Chinese accents.  I'm curious whether this is ONLY a function of trained historical associations that have been implanted in our culture, or if the human ear possesses a natural \"liking\" for certain phonetic structures and will classify those sounds as \"auditorily pleasing\" while \"disliking\" other phonetic combinations. In other words, if Asians hadn't been demonized in American culture, would we still naturally find Asian accents unattractive (a la the bouba/kiki effect where certain sounds are automatically mapped to round or sharp shapes - maybe a similar mapping exists for \"pleasing\" vs \"unpleasing\" accents?)

Go back about 250 years and the dominant idea was that French was a serious, weighty language most suitable for *diplomacy*, while German was a romantic, expressive language, the ideal language for *poetry*. Yes, poetry.   Nowadays, most would opine that French is sexy and most suitable for love, while German is a heavy, plodding, guttural language perhaps best suited for war, fighting and philosophy.  In this timeframe, French and German have changed very little, yet our attitudes about them have shifted a great deal. This goes to show that attitudes about languages come from the observer and his culture, not from the languages themselves.  Linguistically, these attitudes are of course all nonsense. Except to the extent that some linguists study these attitudes, as they can tell us a lot about speakers.  > ...if the human ear possesses a natural \"liking\" for certain phonetic structures and will classify those sounds as \"auditorily pleasing\" while \"disliking\" other phonetic combinations.  Neither the human ear nor what really matters, the brain, has an aesthetic preference for any one of the myriad sounds found in human language. Again, it's all about our attitudes toward speakers.  A great example of this is that both French and German have an /r/ sound that is a voiceless velar or uvular fricative. This is a \"rough\", \"guttural\" sound produced in the very back of the mouth by a powerful airstream that generates fairly intense aperiodic acoustic energy, which is the technical definition of \"noise\".   English speakers tend to fixate on this sound when it's found in German, imitating it and pointing to it as proof that German is a \"harsh\" and \"guttural\" language. When the same or very similar sounds are heard in *French*, however, none of this happens, and French is nonetheless praised for being \"romantic\", \"mellifluous\", etc.  So we have the same sound classified in opposite ways depending on who uses it.  Again, because we project our attitudes toward speakers onto their language.  In the US we can see this in various manifestations. Take the /f/ sound, which is a voiceless labiodental fricative. In some words we don't even notice it, like \"half\" and \"finger\". It just is, and we pay no heed to it in such words. But the instant you put it in a word where the majority uses another sound, like \"with\" pronounced as \"wif\", alarm bells go off, and we label these speakers as ignorant or uneducated. Not because of the sound itself, which all English speakers produce, but because of *who* uses this sound in a set of words that normally has \"th\" -- in the US this feature is largely found in African-American English, which is spoken by what is called a \"low prestige\" group in sociolinguistics.  As a final example, let's take the voiced labio-velar approximant /r/. This is an /r/ you make with the lower lip touching the upper teeth, as when you say /v/. When Americans hear Brits use it they either pay no attention to it or they find it posh. When they hear other Americans use it, though, they either find it intensely infantile or they classify it as a speech defect!  It's all about *who* is speaking, not *how*."

I was surprised to see that President Reagan and his Administration are rated highly by historians.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical\\_rankings\\_of\\_presidents\\_of\\_the\\_United\\_States  I express surprise because, from my own research and understanding, many of Reagan's policies like trickle-down economics, repealing the Fairness Doctrine, propagating the myth of the Welfare Queen, Iran-Contra, and of course spurring the War on Drugs have had a negative impact on the United State's economy and society. What is the reason for this contrast?\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " Ah. Well. From the graveyard of removed comments I think we can surmise that even a good 31 years after the end of Reagan's presidency, and more than 16 years after his death, his Presidency produces *feelings*, both strongly positive and negative.   Anyway, if we dive into the results linked to on the Wkipedia page,  we can tease out some possible answers to your question. First, we're discounting the popular surveys - the fact that JFK, Bill Clinton and Reagan tend to rank the highest in those surveys makes me believe that a lot of the polled Americans associate nostalgia with Presidential administrations, and that's a whole different field to cover.  So focusing on the scholar surveys and the scores as linked, first we should note one very curious thing - of the sixteen total sources listed, the first five very solidly place Reagan in the middling range, mostly being in the third quartile. It's only around 2000 that Reagan marches up to the top ranks. So for a good decade or so after Reagan's presidency, his legacy was considered by historians to be extremely ambivalent.  Now, to focus on the 21st century sources, I'm very much drawn to the Sierra College Research Institute and C-SPAN in particular, because unlike the others, which seem to be mostly asking historians \"give this president a score, and we'll tally all the figures up\", these two surveys both were conducted a number of times, and breakdown the scores for each president into sub-categories, so we are able to see in which areas historians think a President's administration was good, middling and poor.   The most recent Sierra College data is here, for those who are interested, and the most recent C-SPAN data is here.  Now we see some further curious things. Starting with the C-SPAN data, Reagan's highest scores are \"Public Persuasion\" (90.9), \"Vision/Setting an Agenda\" (84.9), and \"International Relations\" (76.8). His three lowest scores are \"Pursued Equal Justice for All\" (44.6), \"Administrative Skills\" (47.4), and \"Economic Management\" (60.9 - this actually puts him 16th and in between John Adams and John Quincy Adams). So interestingly, even though this survey overall ranks Reagan as 9th, it's with his administration itself being considered not well run, being very unequal in its domestic impacts, and having OK-but-not-amazing economic returns.  Now let's look at Sierra College (Reagan score: 13th), which has a frankly dizzying data set with overall scores, overall sub-scores in \"Attributes\", \"Abilities\" and \"Accomplishments\", and then *sub-sub-scores* within those fields. Now we are *really* drilling down into data. All his scores are relatively high (nothing in Buchanan or Andrew Johnson territory), but some are middling. His lowest scores are \"Intelligence\" (31), \"Background\" (27), \"Integrity\" (24), and \"Executive Appointments\" (20). In the middle are \"Court Appointments\" (18), \"Handling of US Economy\" (18), and \"Domestic Accomplishments\" (16), and his highest scores are \"Leadership Ability\" (7), \"Relationship with Congress\" (6), \"Party Leadership\" (4), and most notably \"Luck\"(3).  Honestly the Sierra College rankings feel almost like damning Reagan with faint praise. He comes off as relatively unimaginative, and with an OK-but-not-great domestic record, but outstanding scores on vision, communication and above all luck.   I think there's something to this. There is a lot to be said for Reagan being \"the Great Communicator\", who more or less realigned US politics with his election, and steered the Republican Party towards a form of ideological conservatism (beating out the party's older, more moderate and Northeastern wing, best personified by George H.W. Bush), and on top of that was able to win away \"Reagan Democrats\" in his two election victories, although it's worth noting that this didn't necessarily translate into Republican victories further down the slate: the House of Representatives kept its Democratic majority from 1955 to 1995, despite Reagan's electoral success, and despite his 1980 victory helping to flip the Senate to a Republican majority in 1981 (for the first time since 1955), it reverted to a Democratic majority in 1987. Reagan did have a knack for boiling complicated ideas down into simple phrases that he could deliver with aplomb, in no small part because of his acting background (\"There you go again\", \"Trust But Verify\", \"A Recession is when your neighbor loses a job, a depression is when you lose your job, and recovery is when President Carter loses his\").   But I want to focus a bit on that highest score in particular: in a lot of ways, Reagan was a *lucky* president. Deregulation was started in the 1970s, and busting inflation was initiated by Fed Chairman Paul Volcker in 1979, but the actual economic benefits accrued under Reagan's presidency. Even anti-inflationary policies (in part spurred by the Fed trying to raise interest rates to fight the danger of inflation caused in no small part by Reagan's deficit spending) caused a severe and long-lasting downturn from July 1981 to November 1982 that saw unemployment rise to its highest levels since the Great Depression, and Reagan's approval ratings sink. It's by some luck, however, that this cleared up and the economy began growing before the 1984 elections (in reverse, George H.W. Bush had the *highest approval ratings ever* in 1991, but the following recession in 1992 destroyed those ratings and helped in his electoral defeat that year). Reagan was also lucky that his aggressive stance towards the Soviet Union in 1981-1983 didn't unintentionally ignite World War III, especially during the 1983 Able Archer exercises that the Soviet leadership feared was a cover for an actual first strike. He's lucky that his Soviet counterpart from 1985 on was Mikhail Gorbachev, who was genuinely interested in de-escalation of Cold War tensions, and built a successful diplomatic relationship with Reagan - and also unilaterally did much of the work, despite what myths of \"Reagan winning the Cold War\" or \"Reagan defeating Communism\" might say. He's lucky that the Iran-Contra Affair wasn't presidency-ending, which it could have been (I suspect the low marks for \"Integrity\", \"Intelligence\" and \"Administrative Skills\" come in here...the best that could be argued in Reagan's defense during the scandal is that he had no idea what multiple people in his administration were doing in terms of violating the law), and that it occurred relatively late in his administration. He was lucky that the biggest daily stock market crash in US history (\"Black Monday\"), didn't have knock-on effects in the \"real\" economy, and that the Savings and Loan crisis that *did* impact the US economy negatively didn't really have knock-on effects until after Reagan left office.   Maybe there's a bigger lesson here - a lot of presidents tend to be lucky, or unlucky, as there are many, many contingencies that occur during their time in office that they may or may not actually be responsible for. But it happens on their watch, so they tend to either get the credit - or the blame."

                "content": " Okay, finally a question that I'm probably one of the few people qualified to answer. My historical background is just a BA and MA in history, writing primarily on US Army Air Force bombing campaigns in WWII, with particular attention to targeting of civilians - I know, not what we're talking about, but just letting you know I'm one of you but am writing a bit outside of my academic wheelhouse. Professionally, I am an Air Force pilot and have flown against Soviet era AAA and SAM systems across the world, admittedly mostly against ancient ones with poorly trained operators. I will make sure I don't violate rule 4 with \"personal/anecdotal\" experience by backing myself up with sources, which is good practice anyways because if I write about stuff that I do at work, I need to make sure it's already on there so I don't embarrass myself like this.   **Caveat**: My training in counter SAMs / SEAD (suppression of enemy air defenses) began in 2014, not 1986, and even then, it was the basics - I don't specialize in it, I don't fly F-35s or F-16CJs like my Wild Weasel brethren that live for this. I'm using old copies of Jane's, which are available to me through a subscription I have from work - these are not classified, but are behind a paywall. Jane's has been the gold standard of quantifying and comparing military equipment across pretty much every category - aircraft, planes, weapons, etc, and has been since the late 19th century. The oldest copy of it that I've touched in a 1898 edition of Jane's Fighting Ships in the stacks at Air University's library in Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. While it is a western publication, I'm using references across the years to get more accurate data. Of course, newer systems are less likely to have accurate data, and data gets more accurate as Soviet client states broke off and allowed western intelligence to analyze the systems or they were seen in combat and western intelligence extrapolated based on their performance.  **Assumption**: You mentioned a small airplane, but did not specify which, so I will fill in. One of the most ubiquitous US civilian airplanes is the Cessna 172 Skyhawk. Anecdotal, but it is also the first plane I ever flew, and probably the first for the majority of American pilots. It's an almost 70 year old plane now, so it would be available for your hypothetical flight.  **Data and Methodology**: First, a quick term to explain - radar cross section (RCS). This is a measurement of a plane's reflectivity on radar. It's based off the material, shape, size, and smoothness of a plane's surface. The Cessna 172 has a RCS of 10m^2 worst case. Worst case means with the nose of the aircraft pointed towards the radar. To compare this with other planes of its day, an F-14 Tomcat would have a 25m^2 RCS, an F-15C's is 20m^2, an F-16's is an impressive 5m^2. Today's F-22's unclassified/estimated RCS is .0001m^2, roughly the size of a marble. Long story short, your Cessna would be measurable on radar if it was tuned to look for something like you.  **Answer, kinda**: Without getting TOO much into how radars work, typical Soviet SA systems are not on 24/7 unless put on alert, they rely on men located at the radar site, and there are several layers of both range and sensitivity across several different types of SAMs. Strategic SAM systems aren't sensitive, they're meant to pick up US nuclear bombers and send a heavy missile that doesn't need to maneuver to hit its target, so they have very high ranges. Tactical SAM systems can be sensitive, but their range suffers because their missiles are intended for fighters that can 'defend' via their agility and turns, so the missiles need to keep up. Go figure, I can't source any documentation of Soviet missile defense deployments in 1986, so I can't tell you if there's an ingress route or not with certainty. HOWEVER - I can make an educated guess based on sheer geography and military knowledge. The Soviet Union's entire eastern half is incredibly low density population-wise, and it's huge. Because they can't exactly make a wall of ZSU-23-4s across their eastern border, there are likely several gaps you could ingress into and avoid detection by flying nap of the earth (i.e., low). For more on Soviet air defenses, this 1989 article on anticipated Soviet reactions to US stealth technology goes into their organization.    The thing you'd have to worry most about is interceptors. MiG-25s or MiG-31s could be flying a CAP anywhere, and although big sky theory is a thing, depending on so many factors (their position, your position, your color, sun reflectivity, etc.), you could be easy to spot with their Mk. I Eyeball sensors (incredibly advanced, I know). Additionally, most interceptors have radars that can be a bit more sensitive to other aircraft since they don't have to worry about the ground. Can't find a good illustration for an aircraft of that era, but this one serves well enough for the premise.   ALL OF THAT BEING SAID, you can pretty much disregard it all, because as many aviation fans know, Mathias Rust was a young, 50 hour Cessna 172 pilot (for reference, 50 hours is about what I'd expect the most basic of private pilots to have before being allowed to fly without an instructor in the US) who took his plane from West Germany to Iceland to Finland and then landed directly in Moscow's Red Square. Unlike your hypothetical flight, young Mathias did not make a return trip until he was pardoned about a year later, but I think it's worth mentioning because he WAS picked up on Soviet air defense radar, he WAS intercepted by Soviet aircraft, and through various failures and breakdowns in Soviet C2, he made it through what was the most heavily defended and fortified air space in the world outside of the US.  To summarize, you probably could, but it would take a lot of precise flying, a pre-planned flight where you avoided populated areas and landed away from anywhere, and then returned without refueling (unless you have a perfect Russian accent and enough rubles to somehow arrange for AV gas to be transported to you), which would incredibly limit your options. Also, you're probably landing without a runway to avoid civilization, so I hope you're really good and can also find some dense ground that fits all of those conditions and is large enough for you to take off in.

Such as it was, the occult influence on the leadership of the Reich was confined to a small circle within the higher ranks of the SS - Himmler certainly had some strange ideas, but outside of a small circle it was mostly theatrical window dressing. In fact, the Reich actively campaigned against Occultism in society and imprisoned members of the Freemasons, the OTO and other occult groups.   Hitler himself publicly rebuked the tendency towards mysticism in a speech in 1936: \"We have nothing to do with those elements who only understand National Socialism in terms of hearsay and sagas, and therefore confuse it too easily with vague Nordic phrases and who are now beginning their research based on motifs from some vague Atlantean culture. National Socialism sharply dismisses this sort of culture.\"  This speech was alluding to the sacking of one Herman Wirth as head of the Ahnenerbe - the \"Ancestral research institute\". As the Speech implies, the Ahnenerbe did have some very odd pseudo-scientific and occult ideas, and it is this organization from which the pop-culture trope of \"Occult Nazis\" flows in most part. It was essentially a pet project of Himmler to uncover the \"hidden history\" of the Aryan race by sending research teams to far-flung locations in order to take fiend recordings, photographs, cranial measurements and the like to prove that great civilizations of the world were Germanic in origin. It's an interesting story in itself with some truly odd characters - Wirth, Otto Rahn, Karl-Maria Willigut and so forth. But it was a small operation and not reflective of party policy.  &#x200B;  The relationship between the Churches and the Nazi state is an interesting question in itself. While Hitler certainly did not approve of a politically active Church system, either Protestant or Catholic, he always stepped lightly around directly confronting them. In fact, the policy of not directly antagonizing the churches is behind the rebuke to the Ahnenerbe I mention above.   Sources:  The Occult roots of Nazism.

In schools, however, it is accepted that Washington was a great general -- from the time of his serving as an officer in colonial wars to his role of General and Chief of the Continental Armies. Was Washington, however, a good General? I know this may be too broad a question to effectively answer so was he a good general in terms of his: tactical, strategic, and field command?

                "content": " I'm going to unpack your question a bit because I think part of what you're touching on is the American myth of Washington which tends to deify a man who was extraordinary because he rose above his relative banality.  Washington was probably not, or there's little evidence anyway, an incredible tactical commander although he certainly had his moments of genius. Where he excelled beyond all others was his ability to lead. He was arguably personally responsible for touching off the Seven Years War, resulting in his defeat at Fort Necessity. For this he was hailed as a hero. He then participated in the Braddock Campaign, with equally poor results. In a harbinger of his later battlefield presence, he prevented the defeat from turning into an all-out massacre by rallying the battered troops and conducting a relatively orderly retreat. For this second disaster he was awarded command of a regiment. He spent most of the rest of the war fighting the Indians on the frontier with some success and high casualties.  His service in the Revolutionary War would be similarly lackluster from a win-loss perspective but he had a crucial trait, a command presence, that allowed him to do what almost no one else in the colonies could have done - unite a disparate group of ragtag colonial militias into a relatively unified fighting force that could survive (although not win) direct confrontations with the world's preeminent military power. His power had political consequences but his mere presence was often enough to prevent defeats from turning into disasters. His primary goal early in the war was the preservation of the army at all costs until it could be armed, equipped, and trained into an actual counter to the British regulars and their Hessian hirelings. He also seems to have won when it mattered most - Boston, when the nascent revolution would have been strangled in its cradle if he'd lost, Trenton and Princeton, when the army was on its heels and could have been destroyed under a lesser commander.  You mention drawing France into the war - it's worth noting that France wanted the war since their defeat in the Seven Years War, did everything in its power to provoke the war, was scouting the continent as tensions mounted before the war even broke out to ascertain the relative likelihood of success if a war were to erupt, and bankrolled the American war effort while setting up a massive smuggling operation to empty French and Spanish armories into the hands of the Americans on credit until they were able to openly enter the war. Their decision was influenced in no small part by the presence of Washington. While the colonial politicians were seen as fractious and unreliable, colonial generals were seen as vain and untrained, colonial troops were seen as peasant militias, Washington was viewed as almost an aristocrat whose word could be trusted and who would see the thing through if only given the means.  It's hard to overstate the full amount of means the French, Spanish, and Dutch supplied. The French realized they needed to modernize their army to confront the British, something they had every intention of doing. This meant they would have a lot of military surplus as they re-equipped modern formations with modern weapons. The French king and his cousin, the king of Spain, created a shell corporation run by the guy who invented Figaro, the Barber of Seville, and fronted him 2 million francs in secret. They then sold the antiquated contents of their armories on the open market, where it was promptly bought up by their shell company and shipped to America on credit. The first major shipments arrived just before the battle of Saratoga and equipped an American army in full retreat to the point where they turned around, confronted Burgoyne's army, and won. In John Trumbull's famous painting of the surrender, a French cannon is pictured prominently in the foreground. By the end of the war, the French would supply 90% of the gunpowder the American army used as well as similar quantities of tents, uniforms, muskets, ammunition, and other supplies. Perhaps more importantly, the French shell company found military experts from across Europe and recruited them to the American cause including names like Lafayette and von Steuben. French money paid their salaries and passage to the country, where they helped build forts, command artillery, and forge the American army into a fighting force that could confront the regular British Army.  Notably, when French forces openly entered the war they had their own plans about the best military strategy to be pursued. Their contribution was not insignificant - at Savannah there were more French troops than American. The French met with Washington to discuss strategy where Washington outlined his plans. Again, reflecting on his command presence, the French not only acquiesced to his strategy but placed their troops under his command. ***Edit: /u/pedro3131 raises a good point here - Washington wanted to attack New York while Rochambeau preferred to attack in the south. They agreed to consult Admiral de Grasse to get his input and he also preferred the southern plan (although Rochambeau let de Grasse know his preference). At least nominally the decision was Washington's but arguably if your ally with all the ships and half the troops wants to do something, that's what you do so perhaps it's more appropriate to say they nominally acquiesced to his strategy. Perhaps fortunately Washington had the humility not to press the point. Either way, I think it's a valid enough issue to add this note and credit to /u/pedro3131 for catching it.*** You're talking a French nobleman, a decorated veteran of the Seven Years War, a Lieutenant General in the most powerful military on the planet (up until the Seven Years War, which was still considered to be a possible anomaly), submitting command of his troops to a Virginia planter. He had an army as large as the American army and far more professional but was willing to let Washington take the lead. THAT is what made Washington great.  So if we recap your question - Washington wasn't great at winning but he was great ensuring that losing the battle didn't lead to losing the war. He certainly had moments of tactical brilliance and his field command prevented defeats from turning into disaster. Strategically, he had a very clear grasp of what needed to be done and when, as well as an almost ruthless willingness to make it happen. He knew that winning battles was important but not losing the army was far more important. He knew that surviving was what needed to happen until his militia could be molded into an army. He had the foresight and humility to let other people take credit when it was necessary to the cause. He could inspire the confidence of peasant farmers shivering in the misery of Valley Forge and induce a French nobleman of the ancien regime to not only follow his strategy but give him command of the army he'd brought to aid the American cause. I would say Washington was quite possibly the only American who could have won the war, even though he barely won any battles. Does that make him a great general? I can't think of a single measure of a general that would be more dispositive than their ability to win the war, so I think the answer would be \"yes\"."

As they day's festivities come to a close, the mod team would like to extend their thanks - to all of the users of the sub of course, but especially to those who thought up some of the fantastic questions that came in, as well as those who put in the time and effort to answer them. When we were planning this out, we couldn't even begin to fathom the amount of interest this would generate, and it is really amazing to see how much (almost) everyone enjoyed this!  A few shout-outs to be made. Firstly, if you enjoyed this, I highly suggest you start frequenting /r/AskScienceFiction, a subreddit which fields these questions daily. Additionally, I know that users are looking to get both /r/AskFantasyHistorians and /r/AskFictionHistorians off the ground in a style to imitate what we were doing here, I believe with the intention of the same sort of mock seriousness encouraged here today, so check those out, and maybe help get them off the ground.  Additionally, /u/gunslingrburrito deserves a little recognition for now having the all-time top submission in the subreddit with How did the Eagles manage to rescue Frodo and Sam at Mt Doom and still have time to record \"Hotel California\"?, which as some have pointed out, is not without irony as it displaced [META] This is one of the few subreddits that has maintained a high level of quality and professionalism over time, thank you..  Of course, to my fellow mods, who together registered over 4,500 moderation actions during April Fools, most especially /u/searocksandtrees and /u/vertexoflife whose behind the scenes work was a key part of ensuring the day ran smoothly.  And finally an apology to all of the users who made non-April Fools submissions over the past day that got drowned out in the noise. Please do consider resubmitting them, and we promise that our flairs are doing penance for the tomfoolery by being extra diligent in their responses for the next few days.  As of this evening, new Fantasy submissions have been turned off for a few hours now, so you will notice new submissions returning to normal, real historical topics. We know that few people were able to keep an eye on everything, so there are a few ways to peruse this year's April Fools threads. The existing threads - which you are still welcome to post in right now - are being marked with \"April Fools\" flair to easily distinguish them (currently in progress), and additionally we have done our best to compile a complete list of the submissions over the past day, which you can find here (and check out last year's here). With several hundred threads created over the past 30 or so hours however, we know that wading through it all can be rather daunting, so we also have compiled a list of just the top voted submissions here for your enjoyment.   -------------  How did the Eagles manage to rescue Frodo and Sam at Mt Doom and still have time to record \"Hotel California\"?

Much has been made of 1950s sitcom *I Love Lucy* depicting the first pregnancy storyline in American television. However, CBS censors deemed the word \"pregnancy\" to be too obscene for American audiences even in the context of married characters who also happened to be married in real life. CBS opted to go with the euphemism \"Lucy is Enceinte\" to avoid upsetting American sensibilities of the time.   My question is: why would pregnancy be considered obscene to the average American audience when pregnancy is generally considered (to the best of my knowledge) the least taboo and most celebrated aspect of reproduction.

                "content": " Lucille Ball had already had one child but prior to filming season 1 of *I Love Lucy* (she was 6 months pregnant filming the unaired pilot but it wasn't shown until 1990). After the first season ended she was pregnant again, but CBS, Biow Agency (the ad group) and Philip Morris (the sponsor) insisted that the show could not show a pregnant woman on television.  This led to an extended argument with the creators of the show; Biow tried to offer a compromise of only doing one or two episodes.  Desi Arnaz (Lucille Ball's co-star) sent a letter to Alfred Lyons (chairmen of Philip Morris) that I Love Lucy was the number one show on television and explained they had previously had creative control, and that if they were going to tell them what not to do they also had to tell them what to do (and given a cigarette company was not filled with TV creatives, any negative consequences to ratings were their own).  Allegedly, this led to Lyons sending a private memo through the company  >Don't ---- around with the Cuban!  although I'm unclear if the blank was filled in or not. All objections from Philip Morris stopped.  CBS still had the directive that the word \"pregnant\" couldn't be used, and the writer Jess Oppenheimer came up with the idea to have each of the \"baby\" scripts approved by a priest, a minister, and a rabbi, and the writers would remove anything that was objectionable. (This is not a regular protocol, although the 2016 movie Hail, Caesar! about the 1950s movie industry has a similar event in the plot, likely based on the I Love Lucy situation.)  This idea won the CBS executives over, who felt like this would be sufficient shielding for them offending anyone.   This led to a seven-script series starting with Lucy Is Enceinte, followed by Pregnant Women Are Unpredictable (*), and finishing with Lucy Goes to the Hospital, where Lucy Ricardo finally gives birth; it aired the same day Lucille Ball gave birth. (This was  coordinated as she knew she was going to need a caesarean -- her first had to be for medical reasons, and the same reasons applied.) This led to an estimated 44 million viewers for the episode, beating the inauguration of Dwight Eisenhower the same week (only 29 million viewers).  (*) Yes, the episode name contains the word pregnant! The name is not showing during the episode and in the episode itself there's a dialogue swap with the line \"expectant women are unpredictable\".  ...  Let's step back just a little, to the 1930s; you can expect the CBS executives were in that frame of mind. From a 1937 handbook for film writers (applying in general, not just to CBS):  >Pregnancy, or expected \"blessed events,\" should never be discussed as such in screen stories. Most censor boards not only frown upon, but almost always delete any such references. Any direct or crude reference to pregnancy in films is considered out-of-place exactly as it would be in any normal society where children are present. It is entirely acceptable, of course, to refer to the baby that is expected, but any reference to conception, child-bearing, and child-birth is considered improper for public discussion.  Essentially, there was a strong enough avoidance of sex that the *implication* that sex had occurred was also to be avoided.   But, again this was guidelines carried from the 1930s: what about the real world of the 1950s? By this time the culture had evolved. If you recall the three clergymen from before, they not only had no issues with any of the scripts, they even commented on the \"pregnant\" word situation:  >What's wrong with the word pregnant?  By the 1960s, the taboo was entirely dead: the word \"pregnant\" occurred in a wide variety of shows like The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Virginian, The Defenders and Star Trek.  ...  Ball, L.

I know that it was also common for good friends to share the same bed (Ben Franklin and John Adams), hold hands, and even sit on each other's laps to display affection.

                "content": " The Victorian era is infamous, rightly or wrongly, for its repression of sexuality. But its temporal and philosophical heir definitely did repress the possibility of the homoromantic relationships between women and between men that had been normal, if not the norm, for centuries and centuries. This process was rooted in one of society's most fundamental adopted divisions, gender, so you can imagine that there are a whole lot of factors implicated in the shift that are all tangled around each other and mutually reinforcing. Some of the key ones include: industrialization and urbanization, women's colleges, class concerns, a *crisis in masculinity* (masculinity is always in crisis), and most importantly, the invention of \"sexology\" as a field of science at a time that science played a central role in cataloguing and normatively ordering society.   Anthony Rotundo, primarily studying men, argues that \"romantic friendships\" in America start to become visible in the Revolutionary War era and flourish in the mid-19th century. The 18th century is kind of a black hole for me so I'll take his word for when the concept of romantic friendships was jump-started, but it was by no means new. In the Middle Ages, Christians and Muslims alike wrote poetry and composed letters depicting homoromantic and even homoerotic relationships. I'm going back this far not for the heck of it, but because medieval society helps clarify key qualities of male and female \"romantic friendships\" that contributed to their eventual demise: a societal value on men expressing emotion (knightly tears; religious devotions) and the very, very limited possibilities for unmarried women to rise above the poorest classes. Romantic friendships did not threaten men's sense of themselves as men, patriarchal control of women, or marriage.  Socio-economic changes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries knocked all of that askew.  The 1870s-1920s saw a massive influx of young women and men into U.S. cities. On one hand, this was an age-old process that, for centuries, was basically the season cities could exist (they were population sinks--on their own, city residents could not reproduce enough to replace themselves given mortality rates). On the other, the type of work they found and the pathways for success in that work were much more recent. The old system of apprenticeships and family connections for men, and almost exclusively domestic servant work for women, absolutely persisted but were swamped by the numbers of factory workers and non-domestic service workers. To support the population boom, cities constructed residential hotels/dormitories/apartments that were often designated single-sex.  That situation made both male and female romantic friendships a threat to the gendered prescriptions of society. For men, it diminished the utility of romantic friendships as potential economic and social connections, meaning they wouldn't be stepping stones towards supporting their eventual family. For women, it opened a much more achievable possibility of financial stability outside marriage.   The blossoming of women's colleges at this time made that problem even clearer to the sexuality reformers and sexologists we'll meet in a little--because \"these women\" were most assuredly middle and upper-middle class. In short: the ideal marriage partners for men...in an environment where romantic friendships could permit them both prestigious social roles (scholars, administrators, politicians, professional artists, etc) and economic *success* without men. This was true, even long-term, for both students and teachers. About 10% of American women at the end of the 19th century never married; the figure was around 50% for graduates of women's colleges. So when men observed, as in this letter to the Yale student newspaper:  > There is a term in general use at Vassar, truly calculated to awaken within the *ima penetralia* of our souls all that love for the noble and the aesthetic of which our natures are capable, The term in question is \"smashing.\"  > When a Vassar girl takes a shine to another, she straightway enters upon a regular course of bouquet sendings, interspersed with tinted notes, mysterious packages of \u2018Ridley\u2019s Mixed Candies,\u2019 locks of hair perhaps, and many other tender tokens, until at last the object of her attentions is captured, the two women become inseparable, and the aggressor is considered by her circle of acquaintances as \"smashed.\"  they might not have seen sexual competition, but the possibility of a lifestyle threat was lurking.  Men's romantic friendships were also under fire with respect to their emotionality. The gradual militarization of western culture over the 19th century (think the Salvation *Army* or the military trappings of the Boy Scouts) drove/was driven by a narrowing definition of masculinity on \"muscles\"--vigor, strength, athleticism, the Teddy Roosevelt stereotype. Whereas emotions had once been the healthy counterpart, gradually the internal dimensions of character and a value on openness and gentleness became a liability. (Marriage was still okay, because the idealized marriage was the husband/father rising up to 'be a man' and take care of his family).  Steeped in all these burgeoning developments and their implications came the sexologists, with an agenda not just to categorize society but to evangelize their \"discoveries.\"  A lot of us are at least in passing familiar with the \"homosexuality didn't exist as 'homosexuality', an identity, before 1900\" trope. This can be taken too far (and often is), but it is nevertheless true that the later decades of the 19th century and early 20th century saw professional, middle-class scientists coalescing ideas of same-sex sexual relations according to Science rather than morality. Instead of a wrong step by step choice, it was an abnormal physical, inherited trait.  This idea got mixed up in Progressive Era utopian visions of societal improvement that, among other things, tagged \"deviants\" and lower-class people as hindering forward progress--just as same-sex sex, now identified with the people who practiced it, prevented heterosexual, reproductive sex.  And scientists like Bernard Talmey exhibited one of my favorite characteristics of historical men writing about women: in his 1904 book on, well, women, he announced his deep concern that the American public \"does not even surmise of the existence\" of sex between women. It was a scientific version of what I see in my medieval (male) clerics skating gingerly around actually mentioning lesbian activity because they don't want to put the idea in women's minds.  But this view of American sexologists, lagging somewhat behind their European counterparts, was crucial to the decline of romantic friendships among men and women. First, because it started off with a condemnation of these friendships that took away from social order *regardless* of whether there was sexual activity involved.   Second, because of the label first stacked onto the participants: inverts. That is, the inversion of proper sex/sexual order. Here we meet up with the rise of muscular masculinity *against* emotionality and gentleness, as well women's political activity and independent economic power *against* the norm of a separate women's/domestic sphere.  And so romantic friendships, instead of a natural part of growing up for men and women, became an aberration--not in the sense of \"rare\", but in the sense of \"wrong.\"  ...Unbeknownst to the sexologists, however, their codification of language and an identity for homosexual men and women gave people who did experience same-sex attraction a *mutual* self-understanding--a certain legitimacy. It's seen as the beginning of an LGBTQ+ movement (if not yet a civil rights one). So there is a lot to mourn about the loss of romantic friendships and what it signified. But this is one story about the past that also has a future."

                "content": " With gratitude to SepehrNS for the tag! I have a couple of earlier answers that might help. The closest one is:  * Since most of our physical and visual perceptions of hell come from Dante or later works, what did earlier medieval European Christians associate hell with in a visual or physical sense?  ~~  Yeah, yeah, Dante always gets all the credit. Don't get me wrong--the breathtaking scope, literary dexterity, theological and political ambition of the *Commedia* make it a suitable and attention-grabbing reference point. But Dante's versions of hell, purgatory, and heaven are deeply rooted in more than a millennium of Christian visions of the afterlife (influenced by various pre-Christian and philosophical traditions as well). For the early Middle Ages up through 1200, in fact, visions of heaven and hell were the single most popular form of religious vision narrative in the Latin west. (They don't exactly diminish in popularity afterwards, but other forms of visions become cultural tsunamis). Don't worry; for this answer I will concentrate on hell. ;)  The Bible does give us the idea of a \"lake of fire,\" but it's remarkably scant on other details. Nevertheless, already in the New Testament apocrypha (texts written a bit later than the canonical NT books), there are extensive visions of the afterlife in the *Apocalypse of Peter* and in the *Shepherd of Hermas*. The *Apocalypse of Peter* is intriguing because it already develops the idea of the contrapasso, or \"the punishment symbolizes the sin.\"   Early medieval voyages to the afterlife often take on, as a whole, the tone of a morality tale. A newly deceased sinner is given a cosmic tour, only to come back to life to spread the message of the joys of paradise/horrors of hell (and, of course, they inevitably clean up their life). One of the innovations of this era, that Dante will also draw out, is the use of hell visions as political weapons. More often this is much vaguer than Dante, like placing all the bishops who buy and sell offices in hell. But there's a reason for that. These visions are written and passed down as experiences that \"actually happened\"--as genuine witnesses to the underworld.  By the high Middle Ages, there's a new wrinkle in the medieval visionary tradition: the idea that \"living saints,\" particularly women, are specially graced by God with divine visions. Although much of the women's visionary corpus is Christocentric, many visionaries receive (or ask for and are denied, as with Julian of Norwich in the 14-15C) a short trip through heaven and/or hell. Women's visionaries of purgatory, meanwhile, often involve these living saints actually *pulling people out* according to God's will and then by their own prayerful and ascetic intercession. Mechthild of Hackeborn, a late 13th century German visionary whose visions of paradise sparkle with gemstones and light, is typically proposed as Dante's \"Matilda\"--that is, that he was familiar with her and her visionary text, the Liber specialis gratie.  But for my money, the best high medieval vision of hell belongs to Mechthild of *Magdeburg*, an independent religious women slightly older than her co-named monastic counterpart. Mechthild has extensive and lavishly described visions of paradise and purgatory as well, but her hell is top-notch. You can read a fair portion of Frank Tobin's translation of it on Google Books (scroll down a bit on that first page), and you absolutely should.  > I have seen a city / its name is eternal hate  > It was built in the deepest abyss / From all kinds of stones of huge capital sins  > ...] Lucifer sits bound by his guilt in the deepest abyss. There flows unceasingly out of his fiery heart and out of his mouth all the sins, torments, sickness, and shame in which hell, purgatory, and the earth are so wretchedly entangled. In the bottommost part of hell, the fire, gloom, stench, shuddering, and all kinds of intense pain are the greatest.  > [...][Lucifer] grabs the proud one and thrusts him under his tail and says: \"I have not sunk so deep that I shall not lord it over you.\" All the sodomites pass down his throat and live in his belly. Whenever he draws a breath, they slide into his belly. But when he coughs, they are expelled again.  > The false saints he puts upon his lap, kisses them hideously...Unceasingly he gnaws the usurer and rebukes him fo rhaving have been moved by mercy. The thief is strung up by the feet to serve in hell as a beacon, but the damned do not see the better for it.  > [...] At the top, hell has a head that is hideous and has on it numerous fierce eyes which shoot forth flames.  Oh, Mechthild!  I introduce that last bit because there is a parallel tradition that passes down ideas of (especially) hell in the Middle Ages: art. Indeed, depictions of hell were a standard feature in church sculpture, generally as part of a Last Judgment scene. And while Dante's \"gates of hell\" have their place in iconography (though note that Satan's jaws have a starring role in the lowest level of hell), Mechthild's reference to hell having a head arrives at *the* iconographic symbol of hell up to the Reformation: the hellmouth. That's right. Long before it was terrorizing the students of Sunnydale High School, hellmouths were [all over medieval manuscripts, churches, and imaginations. Sometimes they are more reptilian, sometimes more lion-like, sometimes just abstract evil with eyes.  As far as conceptions of the afterlife go, Dante's importance is less in creativity and more in sealing the deal. The insane popularity of the *Commedia* and its enduring hold on western imaginations means we are likely to continue to talk of hell in terms of his metaphors and descriptions. But those literary devices have deep and fertile roots."

                "content": " At one point or another, you've probably seen this statue of Leonidas, forever guarding the pass at Thermopylai.jpg).  The statue was funded by Greek Americans, sculpted by Vassos Falireas, and set up in 1955. It stands in a long line of monuments to the Greek defeat at Thermopylai that started the year after the battle and continues to recent times. In 1997, the Greek government added a further monument to celebrate the 700 men of Thespiai who stayed behind and fought to the death with Leonidas.  What are all these people doing, celebrating an unmitigated disaster? Because make no mistake: the battle of Thermopylai was a crushing defeat for the Greek alliance. At minimal loss of troops and time, Xerxes dislodged the Greek army from the strongest position in their land, killing a Spartan king and 4,000 of his men. Leonidas had thrown away his life and that of 300 Spartan citizens, achieving literally nothing. On the face of it, there was no reason for the Greeks to celebrate. Our sources give no hint of the popular idea that the last stand of the 300 Spartans was a moral victory that united and galvanised the Greeks. Herodotos simply refers to the battle as \"the defeat at Thermopylai\" (8.27.1) and \"the defeat of the Spartans\" (8.66.1). Even after the battle, he stresses the constant disappointment of the Athenians at the Spartans' timidity and lack of commitment to the cause (8.40.2, 9.6). Thermopylai was the closest they came to losing the war altogether.  Of course, we know that the Greek allies came back from the brink and eventually defeated the Persians. But this happened in later battles - Salamis, Plataiai and Mykale - with their own separate ancient and modern monuments. The eventual Greek victory against Xerxes doesn't explain why they built all these monuments to their greatest failure.   These monuments started early. Already in Herodotos' day there was a stone lion on the hill where Leonidas fell, and several epigrams to honour the men who fought and died there. Herodotos would have lived long enough to see the tomb of Leonidas that the Spartans built back in Sparta, after they solemnly conveyed his bones home for reburial. Every year they organised a festival and held games in his honour; he was the only Spartan to receive heroic cult. Why all this effort to commemorate defeat?  The answer is simple. Monuments don't immortalise facts; they immortalise heroes. Monuments don't serve historical truth but political agendas.  We have no evidence that the Spartans had a reputation as skilled or courageous fighters before Thermopylai. They didn't tell the kind of stories about themselves that we now tell about the Spartans. But after their defeat at Thermopylai, they badly needed such stories. The rest of the Greeks were stirring; they no longer showed much respect for their supposed hegemon and leader, Sparta, now that it had proved slow and noncommittal and ineffective against the Persian threat. Several states refused to join the fight; others, like Athens, threatened to sail for Italy and leave Greece to its fate. In short, Sparta had fucked up, and desperately needed to change the narrative to show the rest of the Greeks that the Spartans were still worthy to lead them.  So they unleashed what we should probably imagine as a massive propaganda campaign. Through careful management of the information others learned about the battle, the invention of numerous details and prophecies, and by recruiting the legendary poet Simonides of Keos for their cause, they took complete control of the way people remembered Thermopylai. The story of an inexperienced king who led a deliberately understrength force to its pointless destruction was transformed into a heroic narrative of sacrifice for a higher cause. Where the Greeks had accused the Spartans of committing only the bare minimum of troops, the Spartans retorted that none had brought a greater sacrifice: every last one of their men had chosen to stay and die! In fact they had refused to let their allies fight at all, they were so eager to commit themselves to the cause! Their king had fallen bravely in the face of the enemy, in accordance with the eternal laws of Sparta and the oracle that foretold it was the only way to save the rest of Greece! Who would not be inspired by such selfless courage? You know the rest.  Monuments to the bravery of the dead were a crucial part of this propaganda campaign. Simonides' epigrams were set up on the site of the battle so that everyone who passed through would read them. The stone lion for Leonidas made a similar point. Later on, for reasons to do with internal politics at Sparta, the remains of Leonidas were \"found\" and transported back to Sparta for further monumentalisation and celebration. By that time there was no longer much dissent against the official Spartan story of Thermopylai.  Through the centuries, people all over Europe and the wider world have been inspired by that official story. It is, of course, mostly a lie - but one that people find irresistible. They would much rather hear of men stoically embracing their fate and fighting to the death for a higher purpose than of a small rag-tag army ineffectively skirmishing with a vastly superior force over questionable political stakes until they are inevitably overrun and slaughtered. The notion of grimly holding one's ground in the face of impossible odds speaks to our most primal notions of heroism. Modern people still reflect on this story, pursue the glory in it, and seek to connect themselves to it. So they continue to add their own monuments to the pile, advertising how much they are like these imagined Spartans (and Thespians), and so perpetuating the most successful propaganda coup in history.  The state of Leonidas at Thermopylai is hardly the only example of a monument celebrating defeat. There are many of them all over the world. If you want to explain them, you simply need to ask: what cause do they serve? What story are they telling, and who gains when that story is told?"

They've no doubt done some terrible things, and in fact this is the reason why Stockwell left the Agency and testified to Congress about them, but to proscribe complex motives and what sound to me like paranoid conspiracy theories (as opposed to legitimate theories about conspiracies) to them is too much.  That said, returning to topic, the CIA definitely had some role in drug trafficking, and still does if leaks from the Mexican government are to be believed.  Why that is, though, is a rather complex problem to analyse without whistle blowers or proper evidence, of which there is some which I'll list at the end if I can find it.  What I believe, however, is that due to the nature of the Agency, there are a large number of people who constantly find themselves having to justify their work. This is what John Stockwell illustrated; that often, officers would get isolated from their actual responsibilities, by either spending all their time living in similar neighbourhoods to the local ruling classes, or by needing to show why that country needed operations carried out. What I'm trying to say here is that often the motive is incorrect, corrupt or poorly conceived in the first place and therefore not very useful when analysing the action carried out.  If you apply the above rules to Colombia for example, you could imagine CIA agents tasked with monitoring leftists, who live near the villas of Escobar like Cocaine king pins. That means that the advice they get, and the access to government is muddied by these types and they could be led towards facilitating drug trafficking in order to get a better ally against FARC, Unions or Latin American Parliamentary Leftists.  As for reading;  Bob Woodward's book Veil describes in depth the formation of the Contras support in Nicaragua, and although I've only read half of it, I imagine it deals with the Iran Contra affair.  Another user mentions Dark Alliance by Gary Webb, the journalist who shot himself twice in the head for specifically exposing connections between the LAPD, CIA & drug trafficking. I haven't read this, but I've seen it referenced a number of times and the content is rather alarming, but definitely not to the level of your assumptions."

The Do-Re-Mi system of solfege is an aural accompaniment to the written lettering A-B-C.  The writings of philosopher Boethius in *De institutione musical* is the nexus for understanding the formation of western music theory, including the concept that pitches would take on the letters A - G in written texts--a concept taken from Greek music scholars. From its publication ca. 492, it became the primary treatise for music theorists in the middle ages. The full history of western music's development of pitch systems is pretty nicely summed in Charles Atkinson's *The Critical Nexus*. The next \\~1000 years are pretty messy for music theory, until what we now would recognize as functional harmony clicks into place between 1600-1750.  Medieval music practitioners were limited by lack of texts in circulation, particularly with regard to Catholic liturgical music, and perhaps more significantly, lack of a reliable notation system (it was a mess). Guido d'Arezzo in his *Micrologus* (ca. 1026) formulated what we now know as Solfege--a system to vocalize pitches within a mode. Vocalizing solfege syllables enabled him to teach liturgical music more quickly and effectively since most of it was largely memorized and passed through an oral system.  He's certainly not the first to develop solmization, but his original Ut Re Mi Fa So La system with the accompanying visual 'Guidonian Hand' is the direct antecedent to the system with which you're now comfortable. In Guido's day, Ut (we now call it Do) would have been the note G, positioned below the original A. This was the Gamma Ut.  Now, to the dissonance (ba-dum-tss) that you're experiencing. These two systems are typically taught complimentary of each other; however, it's not uncommon in European traditions to teach solmization instead of letter names when reading. The idea of 'C as Do' is a relatively recent development in western music, with its aim being to develop reliable relative pitch in (young) musicians and is given the moniker 'Fixed Do'. Solfege can also be used as a movable system, wherein Do is the first scale degree of whatever key (or mode) you're in: 'Movable Do'.  Written music is gradually becoming more 'C-based' since C Major is an easy key for students to start learning from. I doubt we'll reach the point of renaming pitches any time soon, but for many, C is already the primary starting point for notation, given its primacy in the circle of fifths, its central position on the piano, and its intuitive key construction.  I hope this helps--feel free to reach out if you want to get deeper into the weeds."

                "content": " Ok great, something in my wheelhouse. The so-called crisis of the third century has six parts. We need to understand each of them, and relations they have with each other, to understand what was going on and how people would have experienced it. Here are the six parts:  1) A changing climate regime. The Roman Empire had grown up in the midst of the Roman Climate Optimum, a time with excellent climate for the Mediterranean agricultural system (focused on three major crops--wheat, grapes, and olives). This allowed Roman culture to spread--wine was grown in England, something that is extremely difficult and rare, and has only recently been replicated due to our increased temperatures. The climate was also quite stable. As a recently published paper on Hellenistic Egypt has shown, stable climates can be associate with less unrest. This changed in the third century, destabilizing the economic base of the empire.  2) Changing disease regime. The Empire experienced its first massive pandemic in the 160s CE, what is known to historians as the Antonine Plague. It was probably smallpox. Some form of fever, possibly something like Ebola, followed in the 250s. This is known as the Plague of Cyprian after the Christian bishops whose letters provide the best evidence for it. These diseases were new, and devastating. The Roman world knew disease, but its diseases were seasonal and local. None reached pandemic scale.   3) Foreign invasion. A resurgent Sasanian Persian Empire sought revenge for past defeats on Rome. The new dynasty was aggressive and defeated several Roman armies. Newly formed confederations along the Rhine and Danube frontier invaded the Empire from the North, and raided as far as Spain.   4) The need for local autonomy in defense led to political fracturing and splinter empires, like the Gallic Empire and the polity based around Palmyra. Local legions who wanted to serve the emperor and local aristocrats who wanted someone to respect their needs started raising their own emperors. This led to civil war. This was especially bad in the two decades between 250 and 270, which can be seen as the heart of the crisis.   5) Spiritual breakdown followed as the systems that upheld the authority of the emperors collapsed. Who thinks that the emperor is divine when they keep getting killed? Who thinks the gods care when there is no rain and terrible new diseases come. Christianity rises in popularity, but is blamed by many for causing the crisis. In the 250s, the first systematic persecution of Christians begins. This has the paradoxical effect of strengthening Christian communities, which had already begun to gain attention by the charity work they were doing in the cities. The persecutions are just enough of a threat to make christianity stronger but not enough to kill it off.   6) There is a revolution. Rome had for a long time been ruled by an alliance of the Senatorial aristocracy of Italy and the urban elites of the Eastern Mediterranean. This collapses as it turns out that these guys aren't particularly good at what they do. More and more power falls into the hands of the army, and especially the officer core, which is primarily dominated by tough Balkan soldiers. People like Aurelian, Diocletian, Constantine, and a bunch of dudes whose names start with Max- of Cons-. This continues all the way up through Justinian. From Diocletian to Justinian, 82% of the years of the Empire the Emperor was of Balkan stock. They reorganized the state to defend their homelands.   So how does this make people feel? Well, it depends where you are. If you are in a major city you are primarily concerned with barbarian invasion and pandemic disease. We know that in the 270s the first walls go up at Rome in hundreds of years--the so-called Aurelian Wall. We have to remember that at this point Rome has a population of ballpark a million, which is huge. It relies on the Empire to feed it, so any disruption to the systems that brought in the grain from Egypt would have been terrifying, and the arrival of the grain fleet every year was marked by huge celebrations. Much of the importance of the city was changing in this period, however, and fewer and fewer emperors would have spent less and less time there. The centers of action were elsewhere, but if you lived in the city of Rome you would have still thought you lived in the center of the world and the local politics--senators vying for local office, disputed election for the bishop of Rome--would have taken up a lot of your attention. Many times you wouldn't be aware that someone new had been created emperor because by the time they started minting coinage and it got to you they would already have been killed. In general, it would have been bad--but the really bad years were basically 240-270, and that is both long enough for things to get really bad and long enough to get used to it. In cities that weren't Rome, the crisis meant that many cities that were artificial and supported by elites who wanted to play at urbanity for cultural reasons would have disappeared. Walls were built all across the empire, sometimes in great haste and sometimes with great care, but always surrounding small areas of what had once big large cities. The urban fabric shrinks.   If you are in the countryside you might care less about disease (smallpox, e.g., is hard to transmit unless you have crowds) but the climate instability would threaten you, as would the armies (both Roman and 'barbarian' that ravaged the countryside). If you were an elite, you basically worried about getting caught up in power politics and getting killed. Huge numbers of Senatorial families go extinct around this time. If you are a Christian, you worry about martyrdom--but, perhaps, you also seek it. It is a crown to be won, an athletic contest for the ages, you against Satan and the torturers of the Roman state. Basically, it is extremely difficult to generalize, other than to say that it was a period of intense dread. We can see this especially in the ideology of the restored government of the Tetrarchy. Coins bear inscription like \"securitas rei publicae\" (national security). Panegyric speeches talk about how peasants saw soldiers coming and were terrified, but then realized it was the legitimate emperor and ran to greet him, thanking the gods (the speeches I'm thinking of are from the 290s, so traditional Roman gods still play a role).   We can get another sense of how people felt from the letters of Cyprian. Here he is talking about the weather and other things, in a letter from 252 CE:   \u201c Now the world itself speaks and, by the proof of skidding events, testifies to its own decline. In winter, there is not enough rain to nourish the seeds. In summer the warmth that usually roasts the crops is gone.

The mines have already been emptied: they bring forth less and less gold and silver, as the poor veins grow poorer with every passing day. Farmers dwindle and disappear from the fields, sailors from the sea, soldiers from their encampments, innocence from the marketplace, justice from the courtroom, harmony from friendship, skill from industry, discipline from morals... \"...The wars continue unceasingly, our anxiety is doubled by bad harvests and famine; our strength is broken by raging disease, the human race is devastated by the decimation of the plague...\" \" ... And in your contempt and stubbornness, you wonder and complain that the rain falls rarely, that the land is blighted by dust, that the exhausted soil scarcely produces a stringy shoot of wheat, that the driving hail mutilates the vine, that the hurricane uproots the olive tree, that drought stills the source, and a pestilent breeze corrupts the air and a great disease rots away at mankind.\" \"...On all sides they scramble, they steal, they grab: there is no disguise for crime, no hesitation. Each man rushes out to rob, as if it were legal, as if it were obligatory, as if anyone who did not pillage were provoking his own loss and expense.\"  Now of course Cyprian has his biases, but it gives some sense of what it was like.

                "content": " \"The age of cannons and sails and pirates\" is pretty broad, but I think we can fairly say that between a period of say 1650 or so and 1805 or so, naval battles were often quite lethal to the people involved. The caveat here of course is that the tactics used and the motivation of the people involved ebbed and flowed over time, and so there's not really a straight line we can draw among different encounters.   Just to set our parameters: I'm picking 1650ish to bound this on the early end because the first Anglo-Dutch war started in 1652, and the three conflicts (1652-54, 1665-67 and 1672-74) saw the development and codification of what we generally refer to as line-of-battle tactics for fleet engagements.   I'm picking 1805 as the bound on the other end because, of course, the battle of Trafalgar saw a complete abandonment of those tactics and a decisive victory for Britain.   The Anglo-Dutch wars saw the first widespread use of the line-of-battle tactic that would dominate naval tactics for the next 150 years or so. The exact origin of the idea that you would line up ships front to rear and engage the enemy's line arranged in the same way is pretty well disputed -- some people trace this back to 1500, others say that Maarten Tromp used the tactic in 1639 -- but for our purposes that's kind of a moot point, because the line-of-battle tactics used in the Anglo-Dutch wars often produced long-running engagements, many of which resulted in simple mutual exhaustion on both sides. If both sides kept to a strict line, engagements usually ran a fairly regular course of the ships passing one another and firing away until one fleet edged away, enough ships were damaged that the rest tried to flee, or darkness fell and one side broke off the battle.   If that didn't happen, though, and a line became disordered due to damage, lack of leadership, flaws in weather, etc., the battle could turn quite quickly in favor of one side or the other. The Four Days' Battle is probably a good and also bad example of this -- it's quite unusual in being the largest battle of the Age of Sail, though it's not well known, and resulted in a decisive English defeat in the second Anglo-Dutch war.   It was fought from 11-14 June 1666 (New Style) with 54 ships on the English side against 84 on the Dutch side. The English, commanded by George Monck (the duke of Albemarle) decided to attack the numerically superior Dutch fleet commanded by Michiel de Ruyter in hopes of defeating them in detail before the Dutch could combine. In the event, on the first day Albermarle did not double up or fall on a portion of the Dutch fleet but fought a conventional battle at range, to his disadvantage.   On the second day, the ships again formed lines but seem to have quite often cut through one line or the other to attempt to engage with some numerical superiority; the English fleet suffered heavily in this encounter. Admiral de Ruyter's ship was badly damaged and he withdrew from the fighting, but at the end of the day the English fleet was reduced to only 29 ships that were battle-worthy. Albermarle decided to withdraw to the west, and on the third day the Dutch fleet gave chase but stayed out of range, fearing the large English stern-chasers. Albermale's course took the fleet over the Galloper shoal, and several ships grounded, including Admiral George Ayscue's *Prince Royal*; his men, panicking, forced him to surrender the ship. He was, and remains, the highest-ranking English naval officer to have been captured by an enemy.   On the fourth day, the English fleet received some reinforcements, including fireships, and decided to attack the Dutch fleet. Both sides realized that this might be the decisive battle of the war. The English attacked from leeward, in an unfortunate position for a sea-fight, and the Dutch fleet was able to encircle and overwhelm them. Sir Christopher Myngs, taking over as admiral of the van from Ayscue, was shot with a musket-ball and fatally wounded; with the van falling into disarray, de Ruyter attacked Albermale's squadron directly and forced him to retreat into a fog bank.   Both fleets took fairly heavy damage, but the English had the worse, with about 1,500 men killed, 1,500 or so wounded, and 1,800 captured (many of whom served in the Dutch fleet later). The Dutch lost about 1,500 killed and 1,300 wounded, but had the tactical and strategic victory.   What happened between the Anglo-Dutch wars and the Napoleonic period is a time where there was a bit of tactical indecisiveness, not to say outright cowardice, on the part of the British. The battle of Minorca is a good example -- evenly matched British and French fleets fought an indecisive battle, with 38 killed and 150 or so wounded on the British side and 45/160 on the French, after which the British held a council of war and decided to withdraw. This led to John Byng being convicted of cowardice and shot; after which British captains and admirals had a much stronger motivation to seek decisive battle.   I wrote about the battle of Quiberon Bay here before, which I'll c-p below:   > This is exactly what British admiral Sir Edward Hawke did in 1759: the bulk of his fleet lay off the northwest of Ushant, with two small ships of the line under Augustus Hervey anchored off the Black Rocks at the Iroise watching the Goulet. His ships were often blown off station, but a westerly wind usually meant that the French were bottled up in port even as the British ships were blown off blockade.  >The reason for keeping the French fleet in port was that the French, growing desperate at their losses in the Americas, had decided in 1758 upon an invasion of Britain. The invasion fleet was assembling in Vannes, in the west of France, while the battle fleet was at Brest (at the time, there were only sketchy land communications with Brest -- it relied on coastal shipping for nearly everything, and an army couldn't assemble there). The fleet would have to break out of Brest, sail to Vannes to pick up the transports, and then evade the British fleet to land troops somewhere in Britain, which was a tall order.  >The French were increasingly desperate to break out of port as 1759 drew to a close, and when a westerly gale blew Hawke off station in November, the French acted. The same day that the storm died down and Hawke left Torbay, the French left Brest. They were blown far to the west before they could come about and head for Vannes, and had trouble with the fleet because many of its men were inexperienced at sea after being bottled up in port. They sailed for Quiberon Bay, where the transports waited, with the British fleet on their heels, and made it almost there before sighting the British fleet. The French gambled that the British would not follow them into Quiberon Bay, because the British lacked charts of the area, but Hawke attacked at once and the French fleet fled. The British caught up with the tail end of the French fleet just as the van was entering the bay, and at that point the wind backed and headed the French, as well as kicking up an extremely rough sea.  >The battle was a disaster for the French; the Thesee sank attempting to open its lower gunports (the ship flooded) and the Superbe sank after two broadsides from Hawke's flagship. One French ship was captured; three were trapped in the Vilaine river with their guns thrown overboard to lighten ship; and six were wrecked or sunk. Two British ships were also driven ashore and wrecked, but their crews were rescued.  British casualties were about 400 men killed, against French of 2,500 lost in battle and/or drowned.   The best-known battles of the age of sail, of course, were Nelson's three victories at the Nile, Copenhagen, and Trafalgar. I've written about the Nile here and Trafalgar here -- casualties in both battles were quite high.   Of course, that doesn't also mean there were engagements with fewer! The famous action between *HMS Speedy* and the Spanish ship *Gamo* ended with the British losing three killed and nine wounded, in capturing a much larger ship with 14 killed and 41 wounded (more men than were on board *Speedy*).   I'm going to need to stop here for now, but I will come back later and expand!"

                "content": " Waco was a siege that lasted over a month (Feb. 28-April 19. 1993) by Federal agencies after The Branch Davidians religious group lead by David Koresh was reported to be stockpiling weapons and an affidavit was provided corroborating the story. There was other issues that had arisen as well, such as claims of sexual abuse, the fact that the group had ex-convicts within (ex-druggies) and National Guard overhead flybys revealed a hotspot that was believed to be a meth lab.  Most of the sexual abuse charges (especially against the children) hadn't been proven prior to the attack (although, there was testimony to support it). Also, the Davidians had proper paperwork on all their weapons, including a member of the compound who had a federal license to deal firearms. Local law enforcement was on good terms with the Mount Carmel community and the Sherriff even advocated that the agencies go talk with them.  When the ATF and the other agencies rolled up, they were armed to the teeth and no one is quiet sure who fired the first shot. The scenes of the government agencies hitting the compound with floodlights and using loudspeakers to bombard them with noise is all documented fact. The final assault on the compound wasn't simply a martyrdom though, as the Branch Davidians fought their attackers. The use of military grade smoke grenades was approved for the final assault, partly because of reports of child abuse going on in the compound (which the FBI Hostage Rescue Team later denied that there was any signs of abuse on the children).  What the show doesn't show (besides the final gunbattle), was that David Koresh, when he originally called the police, began a bibical rant that left the police dispatcher confused on what he was even talking about. According to government autopsies performed, at least 20 of the 76 who died on April 19 were either mercy killed or murdered by other Branch Davidians.  The show is reasonable accurate and doesn't try to go out of it's way to be horribly inaccurate like other shows on historical topics. The problem with Waco, and trying to depict it, is that it's hard to make a very balanced show on it. You either have *In the Line of Duty: Ambush in Waco,* in which the film writer, Phil Penningroth claims to be pro-ATF \"propaganda\" or Alex Jones's \"*America Wake Up (Or Waco)*\" which is all about Waco being a governmental conspiracy. It's usually either pro or anti-government and it's been difficult for some reason to give a middle ground.  Much of the problem has to do with just how controversial the whole situation is, and there isn't even consensus on the evidence. Some independent investigators after the Siege were pretty certain the ATF, National Guard and FBI had actually tampered with the area to bury much of the evidence of wrong-doing, while the image of a M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle taking part on the assault on the final day has been debated whether it had a flame thrower attached to it and if they ran over a Branch Davidian and dragged their body under the vehicle's tires. There is also the issues of the fires themselves. The government claims that those in the compound started the fires but those Branch Davidians that escaped not only deny they started it, but blame the attackers as purposefully starting the fires to burn them out.  It's a messy tragedy that we'll never know the full truth of what happened, no matter how accurately a show tries to portray it.  Edit 1: I have been asked about what exactly is \"military grade tear gas\". I did address it as a response but those who want to know: The closest I can find to what exactly would qualify as \"military grade\", as what I've read on Waco called it, is that there are 3 grades of tear gas, CN, CS and CR. CS is the one most law enforcement uses and CR, which is probably the military grade, is known to be between 6 to 10 times more powerful, and can kill within minutes in a poorly ventilated room."

                "content": " I'd say there is certainly an element of truth in both points, but only as long as the plans are understood as part of a far broader attempt to modernise the city in different ways. In this sense, military concerns weren't the only reason for the program, but rebellion was one of a number of perceived social ills which Paris' modernisation was designed to combat.  Nineteenth century France had a highly turbulent political atmosphere, not only due to the aftermath and legacies of the 1789 Revolution but also due to a number of major rebellions. Between 1830 and 1848, Paris saw six armed uprisings, so it would not be unsurprising that there might be a desire for better crowd control. However, in 1870-1 there was another uprising, known as the \"Paris Commune\", which Rougerie argues was easily suppressed because the army vastly outnumbered the Communards, and not because of the boulevards (2014: 115) Interestingly, de Moncan argues that Hausmann may have exaggerated the military purposes of the urban renewal programme to make it more attractive to Parliament (2012: 34). In short, the urban renewal plan was thought of by some as a means to achieve easier crowd control, but it wasn't very effective.   However, to think of \"Haussmanisation\" only in these terms is to oversimplify it. Urban modernisation plans in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries across the globe responded to a range of perceived social ills or pathologies which were deemed to be holding the nation / society back. These social ills often included (but were not limited to): poverty, disease, alcoholism, prostitution, and political radicalism. Michel Foucault argues (not without criticism) that modernising trends responded to the \"haunting memory of \u2018contagions\u2019, of the plague, of rebellions\" (1997: 198) and that modern states developed a number of mechanisms and techniques for ridding society of these ills. This kind of plan was by no means to Haussman's Paris, and Leif Jerram's book 'Streetlife' (2011) is a particularly good account of how these trends have continued in the twentieth century.   So whilst, yes, Hausmann's reorganisation was perhaps partly motivated by the potential for greater crowd control, it was more deeply influenced by an attitude which believed that state intervention into public space was necessary to modernise the city, and in doing so modernise society. So, alongside the new boulevards, Hausmann was also responsible for the building of new sewers, parks, and public buildings such as hospitals and schools, which it was believed would help to foster a modern society.  His overall goal was therefore to use urban renewal as a means for tackling a whole range of issues, of which rebellion was certainly one.    Burton, Richard DE.

Livingston (the R. also stood for Robert, oddly enough) were sent to Paris not to buy the enormous swath of land subsequently called the Louisiana Purchase but to negotiate the purchase of New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta, thereby securing the lucrative Mississippi River shipping route. Negotiations fell through, and it wasn't until Livingston returned in 1803 that Napoleon was so hard-up on cash due to the continent-wide war of conquest he was waging that he was willing to make a deal with the Americans. At the time, Livingston was authorized by Jefferson to spend up to $9 million in order to purchase New Orleans and the rights to the Mississippi. Since the US was planning on making a significant purchase from France, the delegation (Monroe rejoined Livingston in Paris shortly thereafter) travelled to Paris with $3 million in gold. In 1803,gold was worth just under $20 an ounce, which means they were travelling with almost 10,000 lbs of gold. This wasn't even remotely close to the carrying capacity of freighters of the time. \"Tea Clipper\" Frigates of that time could carry twenty times that weight..  Now, the negotiations took a turn when Napoleon decided he needed more money and offered the whole Louisiana Purchase for $15 million. Livingston and Monroe were authorized by Jefferson to spend up to 9 million on New Orleans and the rights to the Mississippi, so when given this offer, they had to make a decision without the President's approval, and just couldn't pass up the deal. Oddly enough, I just read the chapter describing the negotiations in Stephen Clarke's very entertaining *1000 Years of Annoying the French*.  According to Clarke, the purchase was paid for with the above-mentioned 3 million in gold as a down payment, with the cancelling of 3.75 million in debt that France owed to the US for French piracy on American ships since the revolution, and the rest was issued in bonds. Again from Clarke:  >French Banks were too nervous to accept the bonds, and two foreign banks had to step in to provide the cash. The first was Hope and Company,  a bank based in Amsterdam but set up by Scotsmen. The second was a London bank, Barings. Napoleon was in such dire straits that he agreed to sell the bonds to the banks at a 12.5% discount.   I hope this answers your question sufficiently!"

The uniforms, and at some point the 'field' and 'ceremonial' uniforms began to diverge.   Broadly-speaking, in modern militaries, there are a few types of uniforms that soldiers wear during the time in service.   * Utility uniform or fatigues: Usually camouflaged, this is what soldiers wear in combat or when on deployment. It's also what most soldiers wear day-to-day basis while on post.  * PT uniform: Since dedicated physical training for soldiers became a more common practice in the early 20th century, armies began to issue a workout uniform.  * Service uniform: Basically military versions of the business suit and business casual wear. Worn in similar circumstances. Soldier who work in places like the Pentagon often wear service uniforms on a daily basis.  * Dress uniform: There are varying forms of this, including mess dress, which is a sort of military tuxedo and worn in similar circumstances. Some armies also have a dressier version of the service uniform. * Ceremonial uniform: These are usually only worn by full-time ceremonial units (e.g. the Fife and -Drum Corps of the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Regiment, which wears Revolutionary War-style uniforms) or by units with a ceremonial function (ex. the Guards regiments of the Household Division in the United Kingdom). These uniforms are often styled after 19th-century uniforms and they aren't worn by non-ceremonial units.   Today, the distinctions between these uniforms is very clear. In the past, the lines were a bit blurrier. Dressier uniforms and everyday uniforms looked much more similar than they do now.     Still, even during the 18th century and the first part of the 19th century, there was still some distinction between parade dress and what soldiers would actually wear on campaign or in camp. In other words, \"field\" and \"ceremonial\" uniforms have always been different, its just that the differences were once a bit smaller.   Soldiers often had multiple uniforms for multiple different occasions. Consider these Silesian soldiers from the Prussian army during the Napoleonic Wars, taken from Peter Hofschr\u00f6er's *Prussian Line Infantry 1792\u20131815.*   I'll use them to illustrate my points, but I'll try to speak as broadly as I can about uniform practices in this period.   * The man on the left is wearing the simple **camp dress** soldiers generally wore while doing chores in the barracks or in camp. In this case, he's wearing a forage cap and jacket, both common items of camp dress worn by ordinary soldiers from most European nations in this period.   * The soldier in the center is wearing the **campaign dress** soldiers would actually wear in combat and on the march. In cold weather, he'd wear a greatcoat, as shown. Underneath that would be his regular uniform, usually a wool coat, shirt, and trousers. Also note the oilskin shako cover he's wearing. Wearing a protective cover over your headgear was common practice on campaign in the early 1800s -- see this French shako cover from the Napoleonic Wars. The yellow coat facings indicate he is from a Silesian regiment.  * The soldier on the right is wearing **parade dress** \\-- generally speaking, parade dress could use elements of the campaign dress (for example, he's wearing the same shako he'd wear on campaign, just without the cover). Of course, the parade uniform also added different elements like boots, a different coat, etc. In some cases, elite units like grenadiers might also wear a bearskin or a miter cap on parade, etc. Plumes, feathers, and other ornamentation are also worn -- they'd be packed away or left behind while soldiers were on campaign.   You can see a more direct comparison between these Prussian grenadiers from 1806. The man on the left is wearing parade dress, while the man in the center has on his campaign dress. Note that the headgear and the coat are the same, but the footwear and trousers are quite different.   There's a similar trend in officers' uniforms. These officers of the Foot Guards show off some of the differences.   * The officer on the left is wearing the **undress** uniform. This is what officers would wear day-to-day around the barracks or in garrison.  * The officer in the center is wearing the **service uniform**. In the Napoleonic period, it's what officers (and men, for that matter) would actually wear while serving on campaign. As a note: nowadays, \"service dress\" uniforms are essentially the military equivalent of a business suit, so they aren't worn in combat.  **So how did we get to where we are today?**   We have soldiers fighting in Afghanistan wearing camouflaged fatigues, officer in the Pentagon wearing the military version of the suit and tie, and Grenadier Guards outside Buckingham Palace wearing bearskins and red coats.   Well, there are a few things to look at.  1. What soldiers wear in combat or while working.  2. What soldiers wear on parade and for other more formal occasions. 3. What soldiers wear while \"walking out\" from their posts or working at headquarters.   4. What ceremonial units wear.   In the early 1800s, the uniforms for all these situations were often very similar. As we've seen from the Prussian examples, soldiers often on parade and on campaign wore uniforms of a very similar style. In some cases, they wore the same thing on parade and on campaign, just with minor variations, like the addition of plumes or new trousers.  Now, here's the major change: from the late 1800s and to the mid 1900s, soldiers start wearing increasingly-different uniforms for these different occasions. WWI and WWII really accelerate this process. There isn't really one instant of change, but rather its a period of transition that takes place over several decades. **This gets to the WHEN of your question.**   The uniforms that soldiers wear in combat and while in garrison get a lot simpler for a variety of reasons. **This gets to the WHY of your question.**   * Industrial warfare and mass-mobilization meant uniforms got simpler and simpler. Armies had to cloth millions and million of men, so issuing everyone with elaborate uniforms wasn't feasible, even with more industrialized clothing production. During WWI, for example, soldiers tended to get one style of uniform. On parade, you wore your service dress uniform. In battle, you wore your service dress uniform. Even in WWII, when soldiers might get a dress uniform for parades and fatigues for combat, the uniforms were pretty simple.  * The Open Order Revolution of the mid- to late-1800s meant soldiers fought less and less in packed lines and more and more in loose formations. Individual mobility and camouflage became increasingly important, so campaigning uniforms became plainer, simpler, and less-restrictive. The bright blues, reds, and other colors disappear (except for the French, who keep their red trousers until 1915!) and they are replaced with more muted colors like khaki and *feldgrau.*   * Civilian fashions became simpler and less-elaborate. The business suit and the lounge suit become popular for men around the turn of the century. Military service uniforms adopted similar cuts, especially for officer's uniforms.    You can see the resulting evolution of battlefield uniforms for the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Army."

What are the factors that explain the resilience against any historical and archeological evidence that explain the existence of the Holocaust? Why is there such resilience against this infamous genocide versus other controversies that occurred? Please, I want to highlight that I am not a denier here.  I like to look into different sides of the argument as people and I learned that how history is taught is also what it is written and interpreted.  Now the evidence that we have (from what I have gathered) of the existence of the Holocaust are plenty.  Firstly, Hitler's speeches and his Mein Kampf book show many hints of the hatred and scapegoating of Jews.  Next are the anti-Jewish acts that occurred in Germany before they are hunted and killed such as businesses that were owned by Jews were closed and declared illegal, homes and shops of Jewish people were vandalised, synapogues were closed, and Jewish people had to wear tags or labels or the Star of David as a clear indicator.  Then, there are the documents and the places that show the existence of the Holocaust. Auschwitz is the most obvious example and a powerful one. The conditions of the place show how the Jews were treated and the uniform that they wore, and the amount of shoes collected of the ones that were killed and gassed, numbers and tattoes in every one and so on.  The Nuremberg trials are also evidence of the existence of war criminals who used the war effort or had some influence in the Nazi party on the acts that were conducted against Jews and other people that were deemed inferior or the enemy of the Germans.  The sheer number, scale and intensity of it feels unbelievably unreal (I must admit, even I find it hard to swallow that people were and are go to such extreme lengths) but many evidence show that this genocide existed.  Now, I want to show a different side here.  When I hear a revisionists' argument or an argument of an Denialist who wants to question the evidence that was gathered, I also want to look into that argument as well.  Is the evidence actually valid and real? Do the Denialists' evidence and arguments also hold as much validity and merit? Can the science of psychology show that the human species is indeed capable of such extreme acts?  At the same time, I am also puzzled and curious as to why there is this level of confirmation bias about this topic, particularly towards the Holocaust.  What are the factors or the reasonings that explain why some people are inclined to deny the collected evidence or question the actuality of this era?  As there a common theme involved such as paranoia or a certain upbringing or anti-governmental attitudes or imperialistic values?  Why is there such focus on wanting to deny the actions that occurred that were made by those who took part of the Holocaust than for example in other genocides or controversial topics that existed, especially in recent memory such as the Armenian genocide or when Japanese-American citizens were put into concentration camps of their own by America when the latter entered the war?  (please correct me if I am wrong whether the concentration camps of the Japanese-Americans were of the same level of poor quality and poor conditions as those of Nazi Germany)\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " My Monday methods on Holocaust denial has already been posted but I also want to repost something I have written some time ag about holocaust denial, its history, prevalence and motive.  **Part 1**  The short version is that people adjust what they choos to believe in accordance with their political prejudices and opinions most of the time and people who advocate Holocaust denial are, in large parts, anti-Semites of some flavor or another.  ## What is the Holocaust? What is Holocaust Denial?  As a starting point, I'm going to define what is the Holocaust and subsequently, what is Holocaust Denial.  Within the relevant scholarly literature, the term Holocaust is defined as the systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of approximately six million Jews and up to half a million Roma, Sinti, and other groups persecuted as \"gypsies\" by the Nazi regime and its collaborators. It took place at the same time as other atrocities and crimes such as the Nazis targeting other groups on grounds of their perceived \"inferiority\", like the disabled and Slavs, and on grounds of their religion, ideology or behavior among them Communists, Socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses and homosexuals. During their 12-year reign, the conservative estimate of victims of Nazi oppression and murder numbers 11 million people, though newer studies put that number at somewhere between 15 and 20 million people.  Holocaust Denial is the attempt and effort to negate, distort, and/or minimize and trivialize the established facts about the Nazi genocides against Jews, Roma, and others most often with the goal to rehabilitate Nazism as an ideology.  Because of the staggering numbers given above, the fact that the Nazi regime applied the tools at the disposal of the modern state to genocidal ends, their sheer brutality, and a variety of other factors, the ideology of Nazism and the broader historical phenomenon of Fascism in which Nazism is often placed, have become \u2013 rightfully so \u2013 politically tainted. As and ideology that is at its core racist, anti-Semitic, and genocidal, Nazism and Fascism have become politically discredited throughout most of the world.  Holocaust Deniers primarily seek to remove this taint from the ideology of Nazism by distorting, ignoring, and misrepresenting historical fact and thereby make Nazism and Fascism socially acceptable again. In other words, Holocaust Denial is a form of political agitation in the service of bigotry, racism, and anti-Semitism.  In his book *Lying about Hitler* Richard Evans summarizes the following points as the most frequently held beliefs of Holocaust Deniers:  > (a) The number of Jews killed by the Nazis was far less than 6 million; it amounted to only a few hundred thousand, and was thus similar to, or less than, the number of German civilians killed in Allied bombing raids. > > (b) Gas chambers were not used to kill large numbers of Jews at any time. > > (c) Neither Hitler nor the Nazi leaderhsip in general had a program of exterminating Europe's Jews; all they wished to do was to deport them to Eastern Europe. > > (d) \"The Holocaust\" was a myth invented by Allied propaganda during the war and sustained since then by Jews who wished to use it for political and financial support for the state of Israel or for themselves. The supposed evidence for the Nazis' wartime mass murder of millions of Jews by gassing and other means was fabricated after the war.  Richard Evans: *Lying about Hitler. History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial*, New York 2001, p. 110]  ## A short history of Holocaust Denial and its methods in the West  Holocaust denialism has its roots in the Nazis' own efforts to hide their crimes from the world. I have gone into this before [here. Especially the efforts of Sonderkommando 1005 and the destruction of records at the end of the war was intended to hide and deny these crimes and thus portray the regime in a more positive light.  This was , of course, used in Nuremberg and other various post war trials by the defendants, who either pushed a narrative of not having known, not having been involved, or all going back to Hitler, Himmler, Heydrich and others who were dead or otherwise not present at Nuremberg (Eichmann e.g., who was made out by Dieter Wisliceny to be sort of a master mind of the Holocaust). Similarly, several defendants at Nuremberg engage in what has developed to become a classical tactics of deniers, e.g. minimizing the numbers, taking code language out of context with phrases such as resettlement, chalking up deaths to disease etc.  Also, surrounding Nuremberg and the revelations of the Nazi crimes, several different strands of fascist, right-wing extremist, and Nazi political agendas started to deny the Holocaust for a variety for reasons. In Germany, you -- of course -- have all the former Nazis who in order present a clean image of the regime and to rehabilitate themselves and the Nazi regime started to write books where they claimed the Holocaust to have either not happened or be the result of a Jewish conspiracy. For example, Otto von dem Bach-Zelewski, former head of an Einsatzgruppe, who had freely given information at the Nuremberg trials and thus saved his skin started in the 1950s to once again reverse his stand and put out a wealth of denialist literature. Similarly, a plethora of former Wehrmacht generals and officers engaged in their own form of denial by either denying the crimes of the regime outright or by presenting the Wehrmacht as not involved in such crimes. Especially the latter, the myth of the clean Wehrmacht, was one of the most successful forms of Holocaust denial and was very popular in Germany until the 80s and can still be observed today.  Another political agenda that used Holocaust denialism as its tool right after the war, was a certain strand of proto-fascist and right-wing extremist thinkers who wanted to clean fascism and their ideology from the strain of being associated with Hitler and the Holocaust. Douglas Reed is such an example. Reed, who was a prominent journalist in Great Britain, was against Hitler but not against Nationalsocialism (he favored the Otto Strasser position). In the late 40s, early 50s he started publishing books which claimed Hitler had been a Zionist agent and his policy of killing the Jews was a Jewish plot to justify the creation of Israel and which was done against the wishes of many Nazis. At some point it became increasingly hard for him to find publishers, so he moved to South Africa and became involved in supporting apartheid politics in SA and Rhodesia.  Another -- and rather odd -- strand of denialism comes from a pacifists. Pacifism had been very popular during the time between the World Wars because of the effects of WWI and after World War Two, a couple of people of the radical pacifist movement saw their positions threatened because the crimes of the Nazis were a major reason why the war against Nazi Germany was portrayed as a moral and necessary war. In the United States, a former mainstream historian and pacifist activist, Harry Elmer Barnes, started publishing literature that claimed the Holocaust was an Allied invention to justify their war against German, which they had started in 1939.  Another example of this is the -- still cited by Holocaust deniers to this day -- work of Paul Rassinier, who in many a ways is the father of modern Holocaust denial. Rassinier, also a staunch pacifist, was a member of the French resistance, where he -- unsuccessfully -- tried to get the Resistance to engage the Nazi occupation peacefully rather than with violence. Arrested by the Nazis in 1943 and deported to the Buchenwald and later Dora-Mittelbau Concentration Camps, Rassinier did write several books and pamphlets after the war in which he denied the existence of gas chambers and of mass extermination - ostensibly because he had never experienced it.  Rassinier was an odd fellow, whose work could be engaged in its own journal article. He, for example, did not deny the brutality of the camps but instead of holding the SS responsible, he blamed his fellow prisoners. Something, which could and has been engaged in modern scholarship as the result of the perfidious Nazi camp system.  But aside from the reason of Rassinier denying the Holocaust because he never experienced it, he also started to engage in Holocaust denial because he was an anti-Semite and a lot of his writing is informed by his hatred for Jews and the state of Israel, which he saw as based on a Jewish lie and as a threat to peace. The fact that Rassinier was a survivor, an academically trained historian, and a Holocaust denying anti-Semite makes his works favorites in denialist circles to this day.  Holocaust denialism the way we know it today started in the 1960s/70s with the rise of neo-fascist and neo-extreme rightits political movements and causes. Not directly referencing Nazism and old-school fascism as their sources of inspiration but still viewing themselves in the same historical lineage, a lot of these people saw themselves as the right counter-movement to the New Left of 1968 and so on. From Arthur Butz to David Irving, it was this generation who had not themselves taken part in the war and in the Anglosphere rejected the narratives of their elders as the Second World War being just, which formed the most tropes, arguments and methods used by Holocaust deniers to this day. This ranges from the supposedly \"scientific\" denialism of Leuchter and Z\u00fcndel to the more subtle relativism of Irving and Nolte to the outright denial of everything like Faurisson's."

                "content": " Eighteenth-century British North America isn't one of the three places you identified, but I suspect this will be interesting to you and others.  To understand wealth in eighteenth-century America, historians often use tax lists. Their study of them hasn't been comprehensive, but has in many cases focused on large port cities (which aren't necessarily representative of the rest of the continent). These tax lists are a bit quirky. They weren't produced every year, or even every decade. Only a few have survived. They don't necessarily account for all of an individual's wealth, because some folks were very good at hiding wealth from tax assessors. Moreover, they tend to only count heads of household or individuals with property (usually white men, sometimes widows, never enslaved people).   With those limitations in mind, what historians have found is that if you divide these tax lists into brackets, those at the top did own an extremely high proportion of the wealth, particularly in the late eighteenth century. I haven't found any analysis that breaks this down into the \"top 1%,\" unfortunately, but here is how historian Gary Nash breaks down several tax lists from colonial British North America:  1693 Philadelphia tax list:  * 0-30% bracket: 2.2% of wealth  * 31-60% bracket: 15.2% of wealth  * 61-90% bracket: 36.6% of wealth  * 91-100% bracket: 46.0% of wealth (13.2% in 91-95% bracket, 32.8% in 96-100% bracket)  1730 New York City tax list:  * 0-30% bracket: 6.2% of wealth  * 31-60% bracket: 13.9% of wealth  * 61-90% bracket: 36.5% of wealth  * 91-100% bracket: 43.7% of wealth (14.2% in 91-95% bracket, 25.4% in 96-100% bracket)  1767 Philadelphia tax list:   * 0-30% bracket: 1.8% of wealth  * 31-60% bracket: 5.5% of wealth  * 61-90% bracket: 27.0% of wealth  * 91-100% bracket: 65.7% of wealth (16.2% in 91-95% bracket, 49.5% in 96-100% bracket)  1771 Boston tax list:  * 0-30% bracket: 0.1% of wealth  * 31-60% bracket: 9.1% of wealth  * 61-90% bracket: 27.4% of wealth  * 91-100% bracket: 63.4% of wealth (14.7% in 91-95% bracket, 48.7% in 96-100% bracket)  1774 Philadelphia tax list:   * 0-30% bracket: 1.1% of wealth  * 31-60% bracket: 4% of wealth  * 61-90% bracket: 22.6% of wealth  * 91-100% bracket: 72.3% of wealth (16.8% in 91-95% bracket, 55.5% in 96-100% bracket)  While there are definitely limits to what this tells us, as I noted above, these numbers are a pretty powerful indication that there was, at least, a high concentration of wealth at the top end of urban society in eighteenth-century British North America\u2014and that this concentration probably rose over the course of the eighteenth century. If you look at the top 10% bracket in Philadelphia, this rung of society went from owning 46% of wealth in 1693 to owning 72.3% in 1774. Compare that top 10% bracket to today, where (in 2013) the top 10% of families owned 76% of wealth. That's not so far off.  The 1774 Philadelphia tax list is particularly interesting to me, because it came just two years before the Declaration of Independence was signed in the same city. The enormous wealth stratification at the time, and the fact that many of the delegates who signed onto the notion that \"All men are created equal\" likely belonged to the top 10% of society, really sets that document into a different context.    So what does this tell us? For me, it's an indication that industrialization cannot be regarded as the sole cause of wealth concentration. Having studied these tax lists, I can tell you that the wealthiest individuals in these societies tended to be merchants (with some exceptions). Just as in today's case where people can make huge fortunes through Wall Street and big banks, commerce and speculation were some of the main ways that individuals accumulated enormous amounts of wealth in the eighteenth century.

                "content": " Consider both the audience, and the materials available.   Most premodern cookbooks were written by professional cooks, for professional cooks. So they often didn\u2019t feel the need to walk their peers through every step- as there were many things that they would expect any other cook to already know. Each cook learned their art through working with more established chefs- and in theory should not need to be told how to judge if a food is ready to eat, or the exact right amount of seasonings. Contrast this with today\u2019s recipes, which are most commonly professional or amateur cooks writing for amateur cooks, and so they assume only basic knowledge.  Although when the pros write for other pros today, they can be extremely specific, due to what I\u2019ll talk about next.  Second, both the cooking supplies and the foods could be very inconsistent. If you\u2019ve ever seen a painting of raw foods from bygone eras- they often looked very different. (Such as Giovanni Stanchi\u2019s 17th century watermelons, which barely look edible compared to today\u2019s bright pink seedless melons). Modern food production is very standardized and relatively consistent, so we can have precise recipes that work out, because generally cooks know how big certain products will be and what flavors and the potency they will have. But if one cook is writing for another cook in another place, working with potentially very different products, telling them to use three carrots in a dish can be somewhat unpredictable- maybe they are bigger or smaller or of a different tasting variety that has long since stopped being widely available- so the idea is that if the recipe has carrots, the cook should use his good judgment to determine the appropriate amount for however many servings he will make.   Third, modern cooks, both amateur and professional, have the advantage of consistent heating elements. The gas stove was a 19th century invention, so anyone before that was largely limited to putting their pots and pans over fires/hot coals, or into an oven- and for all of those it was difficult to maintain a consistent temperature. So there\u2019d be no sense in writing \u201cfry the onions for three minutes\u201d or to \u201cbake the cake for 35 minutes\u201d. Any cook worth his salt should know  what fried onions or a baked cake should look like- so a lot of recipes sound more like \u201ccook until done\u201d without explicitly saying what that means.  Anyway, much like Medieval cookbooks I\u2019ve been a bit vague so far, so here\u2019s a more concrete example of how this works. This is a recipe for \u201cGallina Dorada\u201d (Gilded Hen) from Nuevo Arte de Cocina (1746) by Juan Altamiras, a Spanish friar and cook. (obviously this is from after the medieval period, but it is a recipe that was old then, and I think still reflects the cookbook writing mindset leading to OP's question).  \u201cTake a well-fattened hen, cut off its feet, wing tips and neck, clean it well and boil it in your stewpot for meat. When it is tender, fasten it on the spit. Now wrap a little lump of cured ham fat in paper, spear it on the point of the spit, set fire to the paper and hold the spit upright so the melted fat drips down all over the hen. Crack open four eggs, beat their yolks, paint them on your hot hen and, as it roasts, add sugar and cinnamon, or just cinnamon. You may serve the broth first as a soup spiced with cinnamon and take it to table before your gilded hen. This is a good dish for capons or other birds too.\u201d  The recipe doesn\u2019t tell you how big a hen you need, how long exactly to boil or to roast it, how much lard, sugar or cinnamon to use. But yet, it still largely makes sense. The amounts of those other ingredients depends on how big a hen you have (or if you use another bird entirely), or how much you like the taste of cinnamon sugar on chicken (spoiler alert, my SO did not like it at all when I made this). Similarly, there\u2019s no time given, but\u2026 it\u2019s a chicken. Boil it until it is cooked, then take it out- with the inference to be made that you don\u2019t need to roast it for very long, just long enough for the egg, lard, cinnamon sugar glaze to set. Depending on your fire, that time could vary, but hey, you can serve some nice chicken broth to your guests while you work on that."

I work at a nonprofit organization in Texas doing fundraising and donor relationship management among other things. We don't really have a HR department. I'm new to the field, and it's kind of a dream job (or at least a step on the way to a better dream job), so I am not sure how to deal with some things and have probably made a few missteps that have led me to where I am. Regardless, I'd like some advice on how to deal with this without quitting or burning bridges.  I started at a musuem last year and was introduced to a man in his 80s who donates a fair amount of folk art to the museum. Nothing ground-breaking, but he's been doing this for quite a while and has developed a relationship with the org and a friendship with our founding director. When I started, I just thought he was a friendly but crass old man who was maybe a little touchy or that there was a generational gap in understandings of professionalism/appropriateness. I would receive the occasional \"Forwards from Grandpa\" type email with a dirty joke every once in a while, but the relationship quickly crossed a physical line, ie grabbing my hand and holding me uncomfortably close during a handshake, too much touching on my back, comments on my figure or how my clothes fit (I like to keep in shape and am typically well-dressed at work), to a strange amount of him giving me things like old clothes, folk art, or magazines, which I would usually just accept graciously but throw away or donate to Goodwill once he left. I was uncomfortable about it but I also know I can be a very reserved and private person and wanted to be optimistic about it, as it is my job to keep donors happy.   Around Christmas, he invited me to stay at his apartment while he was away, and I tried to politely decline, and he asked if my email was monitored, which I ignored. At a opening reception, he got drunk and openly admitted to me that he knows exactly what he's doing in harassing me, knows that I hate and am made uncomfortable by his comments and actions, and mentioned that he loves to flirt with me simply because he can. this really upset me because my suspicions that he uses his status and \"nice old man\" persona to be a predator. When I had enough and mentioned this to some of the senior employees they basically said \"it's ____, what do you expect? I'm just glad he's not focusing on me any longer\" and discouraged me from bringing it up to our director. I'm not sure if the director is aware of it but I'm also not sure how they wouldn't be at this point. There have been other creepy things he's done since but you get the picture.   What should I do? I've tried keeping a professional arm's length since, or introducing him to my girlfriend but it's just getting worse. I don't want to damage the relationship the org has with him because it's my job to preserve these kinds of giving relationships but I'm kind of at my wit's end with the creepiness and intentional harassment. I figured initially I'd just put up with it until Father Time took care of business but I'd rather stand up for myself at this point.  TL;DR: friendly old donor at non-profit turns out to be creepy and i am not sure how to handle it professionally Location: Texas, USA.\n\nAssistant:"

An employee barged into my office, swinging open the door very fast, and instantly started yelling at me, repeating herself over and over. It was because she thought I had given her the wrong file, but I pointed out it was right.  My workplace is normally very quiet. I felt pain in my heart (my real heart... not metaphorically) from the shock of her barging in and yelling hysterically to be honest. I suspected I was having heart problems before this, but I had not yet been able to see the doctor. I have since been diagnosed with a heart problem and I've been feeling ill.  After the incident, my boss happened to walk in. I was still standing in shock and breathing a little hard. I tried to tell my boss what happened, but she interrupted me before I finished my first sentence and said, \"You can't change someone's personality.\"  I have never complained about an employee, but this employee has had a pattern of yelling at me over the phone over nothing, having a really crazy critical tone in emails, and bossing me around, even though she has no authority over anyone.  The things she is getting mad about almost never have anything to do with me, and she is misunderstanding how to use something.  I've worked there for 14 years, and she's been there 2. I later learned she was treating our assistant director the same, and my boss was also dismissing her concerns with the personality comment, or telling us how great she is at a particular task she does. It feels a bit like gas-lighting. We both feel our boss doesn't want to deal with it. I informed my boss of all the previous incidents.  Heart-wise, I don't know if I can handle someone surprising me like she did and yelling at me. I'm worried if I disclose this they might say I'm not fit to work.

I think you definitely need to seek (more) medical help and let them know how you are reacting to stressful situations and seek their advice. You might need to try cognitive behavior therapy so you can control YOUR reaction because in life, even if not at work, you are not going to be able to control everyone around you to work with your needs.  I do think having a conversation with this coworker at a time when it is calm and there is not an issue might help. Explain how her behavior is affecting your health (don't have to go into details) but at least put her on notice.     In the end, sometimes it is truly personality conflicts and it is possible this other person doesn't realize how her actions come across to others (especially if the boss hasn't said anything to her).  I'm honestly not sure what ADA accommodation could even help here.  I don't see where an employer can promise calm interactions 100% of the time.

Most of my coworkers are wonderful people with whom I genuinely enjoy working; however, I have a coworker who continuously uses racial and homophobic slurs, while also asking me personal questions about my political views.   Some examples: he is the head of the RNC for our county, and, very recently used the f-slur repeatedly when discussing the behavior of his fellow GA GOP. He has also called a black client an \"Aunt Jemima\" while discussing her with Law Enforcement officers. He has also asked me my opinion of Critical Race Theory, and seemed very agitated when I asked him to change the subject.   There have been other ignorant comments; however, I usually ignore them, or simply regard them as intense personal and social differences.

So, I've decided to bring some of these incidents up to my manager.   Here is why I'm hesitant:   - My manager was present for the \"Aunt Jemima\" comment, and said nothing.  - My direct supervisor was present for the f-slur incident, and said nothing.  - My coworker is of higher status than me. - I am the youngest employee in my department.  - I have the least experience in my department.  - I am one of two women in the seven person team. - There is not a single POC in my department.  - The GA state government itself is very heavily skewed towards one side in regards to modern social issues.

Most of us didn't listen, at which there was another warning, which I still didn't listen, at which point I was told privately by my manager there were still complaints about my fragrance and fragrance sensitivity was a \"federal disability\" (it isn't, I have access to Google) and it would become an HR issue if I didn't comply.

It's now gotten to the point where they're bringing in bottles of stuff for her to sample with a little baby sniff.

People bringing in scents for this woman to approve/disapprove is just baffling to me.   Also, my research shows this is a real thing and apparently some scents give people crippling migraines, but I'm just extremely suspicious of the whole thing unless she has been tested by an allergist.

I have a bachelors degree in IT, one in Advertising and Graphic Design, and a masters in UX Development. I have 10+ years of experience. I was hired 2 years ago for a position I was over qualified for, editing simple HTML files in the marketing dept, I took it because I was burnt out/depressed and i needed a reason to get out of bed. Ive been promoted multiple times in the dept already.   Recently I applied for a position in the UX team and ended up getting an offer. The position was supposed to pay 100K. I currently make 60K. The offer they came with was 70K. Which puts me well under paid, and I would most def be the least paid person on an all-male team. (I'm a women, I know we get underpaid and under appreciated in the tech world). I tried negotiating and all I got was a hard \"No\".   They are calling it a promotion and they, under their own policies, can only give me a certain % increase. Even though it was told to me during my first interview that the salary was 100K, and this was already in the budget. The skills and knowledge needed for this position in no way match what I do now. Completely different dept, leadership, everything. HR even said they would pay me the 100K if I was an external candidate.   The company got bought out by a major, big name company and are in the process of a merger/synchronization of salaries and positions. I asked the HR rep im working with if the salary offered to me fits within the scope/grade that this position falls into. She said she didnt know...i still dont have an answer.

You should have let HR know the second your father was being tested for COVID-19. With all the government regulations that are being released to help people deal with COVID-19, you are the one who is losing out on government benefits.  Below are the benefits from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) or CARES Act that could help you.  The information below has been updated to reflect additional   details we\u2019ve received.  H.R. 6201, also known as the Families First Coronavirus   Response Act (FFCRA), applies to employers with fewer than 500 employees and   covers the period from April 1 to December 31, 2020. (Have 500 or more   staff? You can stop reading, it doesn\u2019t apply to you.)  The larger FFCRA includes two pieces of leave-related   legislation, the Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act and the   Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act, and requires employers to provide two kinds of paid leave related to   COVID-19. Keep in mind a leave is paid to employees who cannot perform   their job duties and who are not working.  You must provide **80   hours of paid sick leave** for the following COVID-19   related reasons if the employee:  1. Is under a federal, state, or local quarantine or isolation   order 2. Has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine 3. Is experiencing symptoms and is seeking medical diagnosis 4. Is caring for an individual under a quarantine or isolation   order or caring for an individual who has been advised by a health care   provider to self-quarantine 5. Is caring for a child whose school or daycare is closed or   unavailable 6. Is experiencing any other similar condition specified by the   Secretary of Health and Human Services  You must also provide **an additional 10 weeks of pay** if the   employee is unable to work due to caring for a child under 18 years of age   whose school or daycare is closed or unavailable.  One employee may qualify for both types of leave. The   maximum pay, in this circumstance, is $12,000.  **Note**: Small employers with fewer than 50   employees can exempt themselves from the 10 additional weeks of family leave   if business viability is threatened. We don\u2019t know what \u201cviable\u201d is   defined as. For now, if you\u2019re going to go completely broke, it\u2019s safe   to say you can skip it. Threatened viability should be relatively easy   to prove later.  **The Math: Calculating Leave**  Overall, a person can qualify for **up to 12 weeks** of   paid leave across both kinds of leave covered. The leave calculations are   different depending on why the employee is on leave.  \u00b7 For leave reasons (1),   (2) or (3) above: It is paid at their regular rate up to $511 per day (for up   to 10 days) and is capped at $5,110  \u00b7 For leave reasons (4) or   (6): It is paid at 2/3 of their regular rate up to $200 per day (for up to 10   days) and is capped at $2,000  \u00b7 For leave reason (5): It   is paid at 2/3 their regular rate up to $200 per day and is capped at $12,000   \u2014 This includes 10 days of paid sick leave plus the 10 weeks of emergency   leave  \u00b7 If a person qualifies   for both types of leave, the amount paid is capped at $12,000  &#x200B;  Think of it from their side.

It\u2019s a combination of employers   A) hiring people or using managers with no experience recruiting. Everyone thinks it\u2019s so easy, but most recruiters don\u2019t make the cut. Many of the inexperienced recruiters can\u2019t handle the candidate reaction to a rejection so they just don\u2019t do it. Hiring managers think they are too good for admin work (and hey they are probably really busy) so once they hire someone they immediately change their focus to the next hire/fire/etc.   B) refusing to pay a little bit more money for intuitive software that at the very least automatically says \u201chey we got your info, don\u2019t call us well call you if interested.\u201d Otherwise someone actually has to go in and click things to make that happen.  C) expecting too much from recruiters. I\u2019ve worked weekends just to send mass templates rejection letters because I have too much other stuff to do during work time. It can take 5 mins per candidate to review and reject them which seems easy enough...  but if you are over worked as it is and you have 800 applicants ...it\u2019s a wild Saturday night reflecting people who don\u2019t meet even the minimum requirements but applied anyway.   It\u2019s also our culture of reality tv and swiping left. There are no consequences for not doing things the right way. A bad Glassdoor review? That really does nothing to someone who will move on to the next job in a few months.   Recruiters are also scared of making a mistake and saying something that will get them in trouble. Most won\u2019t give any feedback at all if the candidate is not a white male for fear of discrimination charges.   The crazy thing is when I call people to reject them (only if they have had a phone/in person interview) I am often hit with their wrath and loathing of the whole thing. I\u2019ve had people tell me off for 5+ minutes because OTHER recruiters don\u2019t call back about other jobs while I\u2019m rejecting them from my job.

I got a performance review saying I was reserved and not very social for the few weeks after a grandparent's death, which I did not inform my manager about because I felt like it was too personal, and my manager is not someone that I felt comfortable with confiding in - he is a narcissistic, boorish, inconsiderate pig of a human being who brags about himself 24/7, and constantly makes weird racist comments about my ethnicity. Can you blame me for not wanting to discuss anything deeply personal with him, and keep our relationship businesslike?  Now, I DON'T MIND getting a small ding to my performance review and I FULLY accept the consequences of not telling my boss my grandmother died, and am 100% fine with it on my record. Life happens. Jesus Christ. Furthermore, I do not give a flying shit about climbing the corporate ladder of this dull-ass dinosaur tech company.  One day he finds out, and makes me come into his office, looking a little panicked, and he seems slightly angry. He asks me why I didn't tell him about this. Now, I understand if he wants me to know that I'm \\*free\\* to tell him such things and he'll give me a break at work when things get tough in my life. He is not sympathetic, he is actively angry at me. It's clear to me that he's just worried about how it makes \\*him\\* look that he wrote me up for not being super social after a death in my family, but again I NEVER complained about this! He gets extremely worked up, and makes this about \\*me having poor judgment for not disclosing my personal life to him\\*, and writes something on my performance review to this effect.

I am a Muslim and pork is forbidden for me. I am a very lax person and I don't usually demand for anything special or extra, just that don't give me pork.

I have been working for 2 years now and never had a problem getting an alternate even from him.   However, today he decided that he would lie to me and tell me the pork on the plate was actually beef roast. There is no way beef can look that white and I had some doubts so I asked the other cook who came in for the night shift. The other cook confirmed its pork and so did the other servers. But he kept on insisting that it's beef and that I should trust him and he would NEVER feed me pork.   I still threw out the meat and only ate the veggies and potatoes.   Later, the night shift cook comes to me and tells me that he tried to talk to the other guy and he still kept denying it.   What can I do in this situation? I am at a loss.

Seven months ago, we hired someone who seemed a perfect fit coming from the same industry. He was very articulate / knowledgeable and was able to answer every question with depth and fluidity. The position was a step up from Senior Marketing Manager to Director and he was to lead a product launch for us. We\u2019re based in California but due to COVID did not require him to move from the East.  Despite being a multinational company we\u2019re small and wear a lot of hats. Every group that interviewed him explained this repeatedly. The new product was virtually the same he said he had launched several times before.  He had trouble getting started. We\u2019d try to help and recommend what to start and why. We gave examples. I made several attempts to on-board him, but he pushed me off. The VP (who used to run Marketing) was forced to sit in on multi-hour meetings 2x a week to work through his deliverables. The VP would ask what he finished since we last met and he\u2019d say \u201cnothing\u201d. He has not had one meeting with anyone that wasn't specifically related to a part of the project he was working on. Those meetings were maybe 15 minutes. When he does step in it's usually an overstep like cancelling a meeting I booked with a vendor because he didn't understand why I needed it. He can\u2019t create a PowerPoint. He said he could write he can't. He doesn't know how to track projects, nor specs and verbiage. He does not know how to write a creative brief, nor did he know why one is needed. He doesn't know how to manage a budget. He was $20K over - to sustain a program, we need to come in 30% under. In this case that was a $60K discrepancy. This was explained early on. He did not know that he was supposed create a go-to-market plan. We asked him who he thought would be doing it and he named somebody not even working on this launch. He was late on every deliverable. We're not talking hours or days - weeks late. There was always the promise that we would receive the final within the next hour or the next day or Wednesday or by 4:00 PM or or or. After much delay he would admit he didn't understand the assignment and he needed some guidance which meant someone else would step in and do it HE LIES - says things are done and they're not started. He says he can't open the document that he got from the agency, but it turns out the agency has never been briefed. He flat out lies about everything to everyone. Our agencies are frustrated. He does not follow; he does not lead, and he doesn't get out of the way. He has made all our jobs so much more difficult. During these 6-7 months, I was put in charge of our nascent Hispanic marketing efforts, new lead generation efforts, and was solely responsible for the launch of our new corporate website. I am also responsible for packaging, product naming, internal creative direction, photography, special \u2018corporate\u2019 projects as well as social media strategy with one direct report for that task. I was also co-lead with my boss on the launch of this product. And, since he did not create a go to market plan, I pulled together a 13-page plan and a new way to track projects and budgets - All of which I shared with the VP.  Several people in and out of Marketing have spoken to the VP who had been an AWSOME Marketing boss especially for someone without a Marketing background. I clearly outlined the issues and outcomes and what I am seeing behind the scenes. At this point, I can't say anything else. The VP is not seeing what everyone else is.  Is there something I am not understanding about employment law and firing someone who is not performing?\n\nAssistant:"

I don't want to give out too much information, but a group of 4 people were hired ~two years ago and took away most of my responsibilities.  My boss has been fighting for a long time to get some back and two weeks ago was a major win for me/him.  But, this group has been going out of their way every day to create trouble and run to the president of the company, blowing this way our of proportion.  Going back a bit now.  I've always been nice to them, trying to help in any way possible.  They have not been the same to me.  They have tried to kick me out and restrict my duties in any way imaginable.  There was an incident in the summer (don't want to go into specifics) but the leader of their group actually tried to get me fired over it (failed obviously).  I want to make it clear that they are not my bosses.  We've all been directed to work together, but again I do not work FOR them, but rather WITH them.  Another incident happened today and another member of their group made multiple statements about how they are my bosses and I need to \"jump off a bridge\" for them.  Well obviously I don't/won't.  He also said that I should be fired for insubordination in a conversation to my boss today.  They talk down to me, and on multiple occassions gang up 3v1 on me to \"put me in my place\".  Almost every day for the past two weeks I come home angry/upset.  I can deal with their nonsense but the fact that it does affect me after work does raise an eyebrow.  My boss mentioned going to HR as a tactic to use against them in our advantage for gaining more power.  I think I do have an actual claim of harassment from them (with almost all of our conversations being over an instant messenger so all recorded).  I'm considering going this route now.    I came here for guidance on whether I should actually do it.  I think there is enough to justify harassment.  I do not appreciate the way any of them talk to me (always talking down and very negative).  I have multiple examples of this.

                "content": " The basic difference between natural and positive law is the source of law's legitimacy, I.e. how it is able to make normative demands of individuals supposedly under its purview.   Natural Law does this by linking the authority of law to something *outside* of the law itself. The most vivid examples of this are religious justifications of legal normativity, where law has weight because *and insofar as* it accords with the demands of religion. Shariah law in Islam is an example of this, but so are legal systems predicated on Divine Rule- the authority of the sovereign gives weight to law, but since the sovereign gains their authority through appointment by God the ultimate source of normative weight is God, etc.  Positive Law, on the other hand, emphasises the *posited* nature of law- that is, law count as *law*, as opposed to just someone making claims, because it is posited as such. The most extreme version of this is John Austin's view of law, which is simply that might makes right- most actual positive law, however, consists of the project of moving away from natural law *without* having to just accept Austin's simplistic account of power, often called the \"command\" theory of law (how simplistic Austin's views are is up for debate, but he is often presented as the \"bad\" version of legal positivism, which most positivists emphatically argue they themselves are not).  Legal Positivism arguably has two main projects inherent in it. The first, stemming from Austin, is the \"scientific\" study of law, mirroring the move of many other fields of social study towars scientism in the period. Natural Law is constantly concerned with how you can evaluate laws and claims at authority vis a vis a set standard of morality. Positive Law sees this as unprofessional and biased, attempting to study law on its own terms.  The second project emerges from a problem in the first. If you are not going to set an external standard of justification, how will you distinguish what is law, and what is not? That is- what differentiates the dictates of a state official from a mob boss, or a stern father? What makes certain commands \"law\" as opposed to a simple act of coercion? This question leads us to seek on what basis law can, if no shared or universal moral code is accepted beforehand, can be *law*, I.e. a command that holds *authority* and *normative weight*.  Answers to this have gone through custom, procedure, reasonability, etc, and there is still debate as to what can fill this gap. The most widely accepted and almost universally studied positive jurists of the Western canon are Hans Kelsen and HLA Hart, with the latter being the former's student and in the eyes of many jurists perfecting his work. Their chief books are, respectively, \"Pure Theory of Law\" and \"The Concept of Law\". In counterpoint, for a contemporary proponent of Natural Law, you can check out John Finnis' \"Natural Law and Natural Rights\".  If you do want to talk about any of this, I wrote my masters thesis on Kelsen and have some unorthodox views on his work- feel free to message me!"

It begins with:  > And whatever you do, in word or in deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.  It then continues to instruct everyone to a life of servitude and submission; wives submit to husbands, husbands serve wives, children obey parents, fathers encourage children.  Verses 22-24 then summarize with an even more astonishing command:  > Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything, not only to please them while they are watching, but with sincerity of heart and fear of the Lord. **Whatever you do, work at it with your whole being, for the Lord and not for men**,\u00a0because you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as your reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.  This command to work with all your effort as if doing work of a transcendent caliber is issued even to servants, who are presumably getting paid little to nothing. This jives with the rest of MLK's quote:  > ...Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will pause to say, 'Here lived a great street sweeper who did his job well. '  Since all productive efforts on this view are done in honor of God, they should all be done soulfully. This teaching is present elsewhere in the New Testament (Ephesians 6:7) and also in the Jewish scriptures (Ecclesiastes 9:10), and the attitude it commends is to apply to everyone.  So, when you ask if this viewpoint still holds today, the answer is: unequivocally yes, so long as you are operating within a Christian worldview.  What if you are not a Christian? Arguably, a virtue ethicist could hold a similar view. If taking all productive efforts seriously produces in one the kind of character which is desirable/necessary/good/moral/whatever, then this is what one should do regardless of pay or opportunity or consequences or duties. In other words, taking such an attitude might make one a better person overall."

As representations, they both inhere within the subject (not within in an empirical sense, like a mental state, but within in a transcendental sense).   Intuitions are singular, and immediately relate to objects in virtue of the objects affecting our sensibility (B33). This effect of objects on our sensibility is sensation, which constitutes the matter of our intuitions (B34). In the Transcendental Aesthetic, Kant argues that space and time are the form of our intuitions. He establishes this claim by first arguing that space and time are *a priori* intuitions (in the metaphysical expositions), and then arguing that they can only be *a priori* intuitions insofar as they are the *a priori* forms of sensibility (in the transcendental expositions).  Concepts are general, and mediately relate to objects by way of a mark (for example, the concept of a mug is related to an object through the object's toroidality, etc.). Concepts unify intuitions with common marks, and this unification is actively determined through our forms of judgment. The concept of a tree mediately relates to objects in the sense that we actively unify the intuitions of various types of trees in accordance with the common marks of trunks, branches, leaves, etc.  So, we can certainly have a concept of space and time (indeed, in the Transcendental Aesthetic, Kant refers to his metaphysical and transcendental expositions as expositions of the concepts of space and time), but this is just a way of discursively understanding the properties of space and time qua forms of intuition. Kant's key claim in the Aesthetic is that space and time are *originally* intuitions, so that though we can form concepts of them, given the specific marks of these concepts they must derive from prior intuitions. It is in their capacity as pure intuitions that space and time form our empirical intuitions of objects, whose matter is sensation."

Althusser's Marx didn't believe in expressive totality in which every component is just a derivative of some sort of the main contradiction like in Hegel's dialectics. Instead he presents overdetermination/structural causality model in which every element of the structure can have some degree of autonomy but nevertheless interdependent with the whole structure.

But if instead the maxim is \"I will steal from women wearing a white dress eating a strawberry while reading the last page of *La Peste* in order to become rich.\" Then this seems to pass FLN, and may be fine on other formulations (depending on your view of how they are related).  The second is a past exam question \"How much of a problem is it for Kant that agents can intend the same action under a variety of descriptions?\". So again, we have a case where maybe on one formulation the act is wrong, but on another it is fine. How are we to decide between them? What makes it the case that we are acting on one maxim rather than another?     Maxims are formulated in terms of willing an action in circumstances to further and end or goal.   So I suppose my question could be broken down into three questions:  What is the action being evaluated? Am I killing someone or just stabbing a hunk of flesh? Is the downward swing immoral but taking the knife out allowed? How are actions individuated? This seems to be a concern for e.g. Hobbesian views of freedom, why not here?     What are the relevant circumstances? Is it the entire state of the world at the time? My immediate surroundings? Only certain features of them?    What makes one thing my end or goal rather than another? That I take it to be?     Obviously, there are intuitive answers to many of these questions. I'm also aware that at least some of these are general problems that are faced by other ethical and even epistemological theories, though I'm not sure that always gives Kant carte blanche. I'm interested in principled answers which explain, for instance, why the maxim involved in lying to a bank and lying to a Nazi are the same and not fine-grained enough to mark a difference between the two, why we can't just endlessly redescribe the maxim we act on until we find one that might moral and so on.

So for instance:  > \"I will steal from women wearing a white dress eating a strawberry while reading the last page of La Peste in order to become rich.\"  If you honestly believed this was you reason for action, I'll ask you: would it *really* make a difference if she wasn't reading *La Peste*?

                "content": " I see a lot of great answers here anchored in a more analytic/Anglo-American tradition, so I thought I'd add my two cents from a slightly different tradition. Short answer is that I think its the wrong question. The right question would be what it means to depict a literary work in a true or false way: What authority undersigns the veracity of one reading relative to another? Can a \"misreading\" nonetheless be faithful to the text?      I think that the \"death of the author\" argument had become something of a parody these days, and not without reason. Yet I think if you actually read Barthes' text, and the texts that came out of French avant garde literary circles in the second half of the 20th century, the argument is actually a pretty interesting one.   At the most basic level you have an epistemological issue: how do we know what the author intended? I think this is the most common *mis*reading of the death of the author argument, and really does boil down to a kind of fallacious reasoning that is well deserved of its criticism. We might not know exactly what an author intended, but we can pretty well infer a reasonable amount of intent (and an amount of things certainly not intended).      The more robust version of the argument contains three principle parts, which I think rather play off each other (and I have attempted to put them in logical order)   1. The author's intention is not authoritative for the text; rather it is the reader's interpretation that gives life to a text. The meaning is not set down once and for all by the author, but brought into the \"here-and-now\" by the act of reading in which the reader makes sense of a text by relating it to their own experiences (including other experiences of reading). This means that there is no \"true\" or \"false\" reading of a literary text insofar as the nature of the text is to be reconstructed in the present of the reader. There are certainly good and bad readings, or readings that are more or less faithful to a certain idea of the text. But when I think of Sherlock adaptations (particularly the Benedict Cumberbatch one), I don't think of them as false readings, but as creative interpretations of characters that bring them out of the moral strictures of victorian England and allow characters like Mary or Irene to express themselves in much stronger ways.  2. Texts are not single-layered, but inevitably multivalent and even polyphonic. That is, there is not just a single linear-story, but a fabric of socio-cultural and political threads in simultaneous operation. The author does not write with a single voice, but takes on multiple perspectives over the course of a story, and therefore records testimony of which he/she is not aware.. (I think a particularly good example here is in the Benedict Cumberbatch Sherlock, there is an episode where they revert the setting to victorian times and Mary's character is made more traditional on the logic that even if she had the sorts of desires she did in the present day, she would not have been able to pursue them. The question, therefore, is whether the person who devised the updated Mary Watson character falsely depicted her, or if their interpretation was merely one in which the socio-cultural milieu has shifted and hence new interpretive possibilities are available).  3. The authority of the author is based on the notion of an intention, which records only a piece of the subjectivity of the person who penned the story. Here we have to pay attention to the unconscious dimension of writing; to writing as the inscription of the unconscious of the author There are therefore elements of every literary and even philosophical text which can reveal more than intended, or more than an author would even have wanted (to the point of them being things such that the author would even strongly disavow). Yet it would be strange to call these \"false\" interpretations of a text just because the author didn't mean for someone to find these elements there. Similarly, the unconscious of the reader comes into play and finds meaning in places that the author may or may not have. Yet there is no way of deciding whether these are \"really there\" or just \"projected into\" the text, because we lack a standard for judgement.  For example: I remember when I was a young teenager being shocked by the brutal and crude vulgarity of the way in which GRR Martin wrote sex scenes, particularly in his apparently consistent and insistent use of the words \"cunt\" and \"cock\" in third person narrative description. Perhaps he found finds these words to be more sexually charged, perhaps the vulgarity of these words adds to the brutal sexual politics of Westeros, or, perhaps there is a certain insecurity in these scenes--a sexual anxiety-- which caused the author to substitute the staccato brutality of these words for his usual, viewpoint focused, more tonally smooth prose style. Or, maybe, in this reading is only revealed my own dislike of these words; my own sexual anxiety. It breaks my identification with the story; feels jarring because mine is a cultural context in which \"cunt\" is vulgar and \"cock\" often belongs to two-bit pornographic scripts. Of course, sex in GoT was a huge issue in the TV adaptation, and they certainly included a lot more of it that GRRM described. But, funnily enough, when I read the books prior to the show coming out, the sexual explicitness stood out to me. The interpretation which \"falsely\" amplified the sexual content of the books felt nonetheless faithful to my experience of reading them."

Nowadays it is accepted among scientists that the most plausible explanation for the complexity and diversity of life on this planet is evolution. The idea of evolution existed before Darwin such as Lamarck's theory of evolution, but it was only after Darwin that our modern understanding took hold. What did prior atheists of which there were many think about this big problem concerning the breathtaking complexity of life? Even Richard Dawkins said, \"I could not imagine being an atheist at any time before 1859 when Darwin\u2019s *Origin of Species* was published\".  **Note: I am aware that evolution not being true doesn't automatically mean that there is a god, but I am just curious as to what did the atheists think before evolution was presented.**\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " Firstly, although we take it for granted now, the idea that nature moves from simple to complex and that we understand it by understanding that process, is not the way people always thought about these things, but rather a worldview that really starts to take hold only as recently as the 19th century. In this sense, that we see evolutionary theory bourgeoning in the 19th century is not to be explained as some event causing us to arrive at explanations we've long failed to have, but rather is a -- in historical terms -- a fairly natural consequence of changes in what we think explanation is. (Or, rather, the two factors interconnected in complex ways.) For a long time before this period, people were often inclined to think of nature as more or less like it seems to be, and of explanation to involve a description of the state we find nature in, rather than of trying to explain how this state came from something simple.  Now, of course, the real history is more complex than this simple juxtaposition suggests, and the two modes of explanation often coexisted and interrelated in complex ways, but in general there was previously a much stronger tendency towards descriptive accounts of nature, and especially in the 19th century there develops a pervasive tendency towards a model of nature as progressing from simple to complex. The classical example of the former, in this case, would be Aristotelian natural philosophy, where nature is more-or-less in a steady state (at least, a kind of somewhat chaotic but self-correcting equilibrium) and biological kinds are eternal: we don't need to explain where oaks \"came from\", since as a kind they didn't come from anywhere, and as individuals they just come from other oaks, all there is to do is describe what an oak is and how it relates to other things in nature.  In this case, while atheism was of course much less prevalent and influential prior to the 19th century, there wasn't any principled or obvious problem about atheism posed by the question of the diversity of life, because the kinds of questions to which evolutionary theory is an answer weren't being asked.  The second thing to consider, as /u/mooninjune rightly points out, is that many philosophers and other thinkers felt that they had in principle reasons to think that nature proceeded mechanically, such that we have principled reasons to expect that a mechanical cause exists for any change we see in nature, even if as a matter of our particular knowledge we happen not to know what that cause is. Now, this sort of approach often overlapped with the former issue, so that we had thinkers who both weren't asking the questions evolutionary theories answered *and* who, *had they asked these questions*, would regard themselves as having good reasons to expect a mechanical explanation for the diversity of life, like the one evolution provides. In the latter case, they would be inclined to accept that there is such a cause, though they don't know it, and in that sense not know what to believe, except that they believe there is such a cause that perhaps scientists one day will find.  The third thing to keep in mind, as /u/mediaisdelicious rightly notes, is that evolutionary thinking in something like we recognize it today starts to take shape in the late 18th century, so that there's already a lot of it going on before Darwin ever gets on the scene. *Origin of Species* is of course a monumental accomplishment, but it's not the unprecedented bolt out of the blue that a particularly ideological-minded populizer like Dawkins presents it as being. On these sorts of grounds, an atheist at least during the earlier part of the 19th century would plausibly take themselves to have grounds to affirm evolutionary theory, though it wasn't a particularly Darwinian form of evolutionary theory -- but such a theory not being Darwinian does not tend to pose any particular problem for the atheist."

A catholic ought oppose both on pain of heresy.   Lets also note that 'helping the poor' isn't the same as communism. Whether communism helps the poor is another question, but one can also help the poor in capitalist America, and could help the poor of a medieval hamlet in the year 1323, if one lived then. Note that Jesus, in Mark 12:17, when asked by Pharisees whether taxation ought be paid to the Roman Empire, replies: \"Give to Caesar what is Caesar's\", which is cited by the Catholic Church in their Catechism (CCC 2242) in an interpretation that, as I read it, takes Christ to say that civil authorities are *prima facie* justified to levy taxes and so forth. Taxation implies property, of course. But I won't dwell here too long, since I am not versed in theology or the Bible all too well.  Since I am somewhat known with catholic social doctrine, I'll say something about that.  A catholic would be opposed to communism since there is, according to the Church, a (natural) right to property: This right to property serves to protect the family and household, to let the family be masters of their own roof. This doesn't mean that the state oughtn't help in distress, but that it should not (lightly) take over the role of the master of the family/household. Moreover, God has since Genesis cursed mankind (or perhaps more accurately, mankind has cursed itself through Adams sin) to work with the sweat on our brow. Mankind consists of persons with different qualities, and these qualities should be exercised through the free will of the persons having them, and they should be able to sell their work as they please. Well, up till here it might seem like classical capitalism, however, the Church recognises that in a capitalistic society man is hardly 'free' in selling their labour. Labour, according to the church has a 'free and personal' character, but also a 'necessary' character. 'Free and personal' in the sense that man should be able to sell it as they please, but it is necessary to survive. These two can be 'thought seperately', even though they aren't seperate in reality. One must be able to live of their work. It is, therefore, according to the catholic (church) gravely sinful to exploit your workers, and workers should be able to look forward to possessing property of themselves, and the state should seek to aid in this goal, and should not fight associations working for this.   This has been hardly even an abstract of the encyclical *rerum novarum* by Pope Leo XIII. If you are interested in it, see here.  EDIT: Note that Jordan Peterson, is, as far as I know, not a Christian, and even if he were, he is a psychologist. Not a vicar, theologian, bishop, (christian) philosopher or otherwise relevant for the opinion of christians in general. What Marx meant by 'opium for the people', as far as I know, mostly refers to it helping leaders oppress them since they'll be thinking of heaven after their death instead of their current situation. But that might be better answered by someone with more knowledge on the subject."

Instead, you should look these up as needed.  * Probability: Hacking's *An Introduction to Probability and Inductive Logic* (Cambridge, 2001). A philosophical introduction to probability. * General mathematics: Houston's *How to Think Like a Mathematician* (Cambridge, 2009) and Velleman's *How to Prove It* (Cambridge, 2nd ed. 2006). Very good background for mathematics, with Velleman a notch up in difficulty from Houston's book. * Psychology: Stanovich's *Decision Making and Rationality in the Modern World* (Oxford, 2010). A psychologist writing on rationality.  * Computer science: Brachman and Levesque's *Knowledge Representation and Reasoning* (Elsevier, 2004). How should we represent knowledge with computers? This book gives a start.  Finally, you may find the article \"What is a formal epistemologist, and where does someone go to become one?\" relevant (especially if you plan to go into graduate study)."

Aristotle rejected Plato's belief that physical objects merely reflected non-physical Forms in a derivative sense; rather, he saw forms as existing only so far as they're *instantiated* in matter. And that's actually closer to the common-sense view most of us hold today. After all, if I asked you, \"When does X exist?\" you would probably say, \"Well, when some matter comes together in an X-like form.\" And that's what Aristotle thought too!   As an example, consider a chair. The *matter* of the chair is wood, but the *form* of the chair is the way that wood has been organized to produce something that is a chair. The form of the chair exists, but only in the sense that it exists *in the chair itself*; this inverts Plato's metaphysics, which would say that the chair only really exists so far as it has relation with the Form.   In general, you should think of the form (or at least the substantial form) of a thing as the way the matter that comprises that thing has to be in order for the thing to be itself. The material that comprises a chair could be wood or steel or cardboard or diamond, but without a particular *form*, it would cease to be a chair at all. That, in a nutshell, is how Aristotle saw forms."

If we compare the amount of deaths caused by car accidents globally with the global death toll of corona viruses cases, about 83,000 people die every month from car accidents and about the same amount of people have died from corona virus in several months.

We do that because if we *don't* work, our lives will be a lot *shorter* than they would be otherwise. Simply put: don't work? Don't eat. That's often used as some kind of moral maxim, but I'm using it in a purely descriptive sense here. For vast majority of humanity over the vast majority of history, the only way to keep one's self from starving to death was to work. There may have been a fortunate few who were rich enough to avoid that, but not very many.   More philosophically, there are a variety of theories as to why work is important. Both virtue ethicists and Marxists would say that engaging in productive work is an important part of what it means to be human, though they generally have different ways of articulating that. For many moral theorists, there's an important connection between labor and property rights, meaning one who does not work won't have much of a claim to eat (the moral version of the aphorism above). For others, there's some sense of moral obligation to support one's self to the best of one's ability, so as not to be a burden upon one's family or society as a whole. Etc. Many if not most moral philosophers have considered work to be morally significant, even if there is quite a diversity of perspectives as to how that works itself out.   But you might be asking why so many of us seem to work jobs that we hate. That's a different question, and there are many different answers to that one too. Marx himself had a lot to say about exploitation and alienation, viewing capitalists' profiting from the labor of workers as immoral, oppressive, and exploitative. So there's a moral failure here, but it'd be mostly on the part of capitalists and/or the bourgeoisie. But even many philosophers more-or-less friendly to capitalism recognize a moral failure in choosing to work a job one despises for inadequate reasons. Say there's a man with a job that requires very long hours, to the point that his relationships and other pursuits really suffer. If that is the only job he could possibly do that would permit him to support himself and his family, that might be excusable. But if he could very easily work a different job that lets him *be a better person* while still meeting whatever obligations he might be said to have? That starts to look like a moral failing of one sort or another."

You can see him lecturing on it here.  Paul Mason's book *Postcapitalism: A Guide to Our Future* argues that capitalism, at least its neoliberal version, is fundamentally incompatible with the information economy, and so new economic arrangements will be required.  Kathi Weeks' *The Problem with Work* is one of the major arguments for a post-work society.

A lot of these discussions get very deep very quickly, and the conclusion people generally come to in my limited experience is that the argument is, at the very least, difficult to disprove. Maybe it's true, maybe it isn't--but most people online that I've found at least think it's a decent argument.  I don't get it. To me, this argument looks utterly ridiculous. If anyone's willing to have a discussion and demonstrate that I'm mistaken, I'd really appreciate it--I may very well be missing something. So we can refer back to it, I'll write the argument below--I pulled it off of Wikipedia, so please let me know if I should edit it and change anything.  1. It is a conceptual truth (or, so to speak, true by definition) that God is a being than which none greater can be imagined (that is, the greatest possible being that can be imagined). 2. God exists as an idea in the mind. 3. A being that exists as an idea in the mind and in reality is, other things being equal, greater than a being that exists only as an idea in the mind. 4. Thus, if God exists only as an idea in the mind, then we can imagine something that is greater than God (that is, a greatest possible being that does exist). 5. But we cannot imagine something that is greater than God (for it is a contradiction to suppose that we can imagine a being greater than the greatest possible being that can be imagined.) 6. Therefore, God exists.  First of all, #2 and #5 seem fine to me. #4 seems obviously true given that #1 and #3 are true, and #6 is of course just the conclusion. Therefore, it seems to me as though any issues with the argument lie in premises #1 and #3. Specifically, it seems to me as though either the term \"greatest\" is being used in two different ways in #1 and #3, or, given any consistent definition of \"greatest,\" one of the two premises is just false.

So mystery solved.  /s  What Anselm means by God's greatness is explained in his Monologium, chapter 2:  > BUT, just as it has been proved that there is a being that is supremely good, since all goods are good through a single being, which is good through itself; so it is necessarily inferred that there is something supremely great, which is great through itself. But, I do not mean physically great, as a material object is great, but that which, the greater it is, is the better or the more worthy, --wisdom, for instance. And since there can be nothing supremely great except what is supremely good, there must be a being that is greatest and best, i. e., the highest of all existing beings.  And a bit in Chapter 3:  > Therefore, since truth altogether excludes the supposition that there are more beings than one, through which all things exist, that being, through which all exist, must be one. Since, then, all things that are exist through this one being, doubtless this one being exists through itself. Whatever things there are else then, exist through something other than themselves, and this alone through itself.

Processing a claim requires recognizing whether conditions do or do not apply to a case. You can connect idealized rules to concrete instances, especially with a nuanced attention to detail.

Clients/customers give stories about what has or has not occurred. You are working to make a coherent picture of what happened. This requires weighing evidence, spotting tensions and contradictions in information, and then performing some inference to the best explanation (IBE). Philosophers are trained to make inductive inferences like these and weigh evidence in an unbiased manner. 3. In the office you will be expected to present information, at some point. Philosophers have experience writing persuasive pieces, presenting works in seminars and conferences, and oftentimes teaching courses to undergrads. This makes you an asset to translate information across domains to different audiences. 4. One sub-field in philosophy is that of ethics. You have been trained in a variety of ethical theories, and can recognize the highest standards of integrity.

However, history has shown that capitalism is not only resilient but is adaptable to the crises it creates.   Also some theorists, for example Baudrillard, contend that Marx's reliance on Hegelian dialectics creates a false binary. Marx's critique of capitalism assumes production as essential human behavior.  However, Baudrillard (channeling Bataille) points to primitive societies not functioning purely for the sake of production but also useless expenditure.  Basically, Marx may only offer a different form of production that is as fundamentally misguided as capitalism.  Lastly, which has already been covered by another post, is Marx's disregard of culture due to his over reliance on economic determinism.  This has been addressed by lots of Marxists over the years, such as Althusser's ISA's or Gramsci's hegemony.  Cultural considerations could have made him more aware of such notions as sign-value or the role of desire. Obviously, it's hard to fault Marx for this since he was addressing Victorian age capitalism but it would have helped him understand the difficulty in creating revolution."

The most egregious example I remember from college, though I can't remember the author, said something like \"man is a social creature, unlike wolves\" - they couldn't have picked a more social animal. I find reading things like this throws me entirely off, and when it happens when the author sets up the basis for their argument, I just think \"how in the world am I supposed to take any of the rest seriously when I can point to this assumption/mistake and just say 'false'?\"  Editors revisiting classics centuries later don't seem to care to point these out or mention easy to refute mistakes like these, so they must be inconsequential to the argument. But I'm just wondering, how? How should you read/interpret things like this when you see them? Should they just be seen as quirks of the viewpoint the author had for the time period they lived in, maybe the place, and maybe the social stature they had? Should you mentally correct it for them, like I could say \"man is a social creature - unlike tigers\"? What about bigger inaccuracies, like \"primitive man did this\" type arguments that may have many inaccuracies and are used to setup the entire rest of their argument?"

That word keeps bouncing around in pop science and social media, but it does not reflect a physical reality that we've ever seen.  There are no physical singularities, ever. The concept makes no sense. Nature does not divide by zero, ever.  What really happens is that the equations of General Relativity exhibit a mathematical singularity) at the center of a black hole - which is only another way of saying you get divisions by zero and other such things that basically just mean math is broken at that point. Or look at it this way: math is polite enough to let us know \"hey, I can't handle this part, you're on your own now\".  GR as a theory is not wrong. We know it works, and it works insanely great. We've verified it in practice. We know black holes exist. We know GR makes correct predictions for stuff that happens around black holes. It probably makes correct predictions for stuff happening inside black holes, although that was not verified (yet).  But GR reaches its limit at the very center. When you get a mathematical singularity out of your equations, that's just a sign that you need some extra theory to handle that part properly.  We know what that \"extra theory\" is - it's Quantum Mechanics. It would be really great if we could apply it there. But the problem is, GR and QM do not play well together. You have to pick one or the other, not both at once. Their equations are not compatible. For this reason, the mathematical singularity (not physical - it's not a thing) at the center of a black hole remains unsolved for now, until we deal with the quarrel.  Unfortunately, popularizers of science kept talking about \"singularities\" as if they were things, the general public got that idea, and here we are now.  It's like when doing econometrics and your equations tell you that there are \"minus one hundred and four\" people inhabiting the district of Such and Such. That's bullshit, how can there be -104 people anywhere? Your math, which may work well for the whole country, is insufficient for that district. You need to add something on top of it to get the real result. And meanwhile, don't go around and talk about the \"negative population\" of district S&S. That's not a thing.  TLDR: We don't really know what actually happens there, and we should stop pretending that we do. Here be dragons."

(actually a physics question, I promise) I was thinking about the structure of the universe, the distance of objects close to the edge of the observable universe, Doppler shift, background radiation and stuff, and I had a sudden realization that I'm wondering about:  Given that space itself is mostly empty, and therefore colorless, is the night sky dark because of one or a combination of the following factors?  A) (this is the big one for me) the sky is mostly dark because even if we could see infinitely distant, there was a time in the early universe before there was light, and that was true for the whole universe at the time, therefore as we look back in time the more distant we see, everything is dark.  B) very distant objects and early structures are receding from us so fast that their light will never reach us.  C) light from very distant objects gets absorbed or reflected by whatever atoms or molecules get in the way, and because the distances are so insignificant great, even though space is a NEAR vacuum, there are so many atoms between us and the edge of the observable universe that most early light never makes it to us.  *Bonus thought that I also might posit as its own question: Given a distance of let's say 5 billion light years between two points in space-time, not objects just positions in the universe: Since the early days of the universe they've remained proportionally the same distance apart, but observationally would they appear more distant from each other? Because space is expanding - so the \"length or size\" of a unit of distance is expanding - for example due to the expansion of the universe the proportional distance between millimeters stays the same, but the space between subatomic particles ever so slightly grows, as does the size of a millimeter. It's still just one millimeter, but would it seem longer than it did a long time ago? Does that mean time is getting longer as well? If we define a second as so many oscillations of a certain atom, but the distance that atom has to swing is growing, does that mean that the length of a unit of time is expanding too? If a person from today were to count seconds in 5B years, would our person seem to tick seconds off too fast?*\n\nAssistant:"

To a radio telescope, the sky is uniformly bright - it is filled with the cosmic microwave background.  As for your second question you have some misunderstandings. The length between two distant points does grow (the number of rulers that one could fit between them is greater now than in the past) but the space between atoms does not. The universe's expansion only affects the largest scales - it does not operate on individual atoms, or even individual galaxies. And it is purely an expansion of space - there is no effect on time."

What they are discussing is only what was done for the electromagnetic and weak force calculations, which is a very small component of the theoretical work (both computational and man-power) that was done for the mu g-2 calculation.  The dominant theoretical uncertainty, and what has took so many people and computing power in muon g-2 is the component of the calculation that is due to the strong force (quantum chromodynamics). This is difficult to calculate precisely because it cannot be done just by adding up a lot of calculations.  There's essentially two ways it can be done, one is by taking a lot of data from other experiments and performing analyses on this to extract quantities that you can relate to the experiment you're doing. This takes a lot of manpower both to perform these analyses and to understand how to take these quantities from the analyses you do and properly apply them in the case you care about, and it also takes a lot of computing power to analyse all this data. This is what has been done in the muon g-2 4.2 sigma case.  The other way is by something called lattice quantum chromodynamics, which is more simulation based. You treat spacetime as being a discrete grid where you have a 'value' for matter fields at every grid point, and a 'value' for gauge (essentially boson) fields at every connection between grid points. You need to perform a fairly computationally expensive calculation to calculate each of these values and how they influence each other, and of course the more points you have the more calculations you have to do. To get a good simulation you need a fairly fine grid with many grid points, so this requires a lot of computing power. There's then a lot of work into approximations and similar to make this feasible.  Lattice quantum chromodynamics isn't used in the muon g-2 4.2 sigma case, but it has been calculated (both as a cross-check and attempting to make it good enough to be used). The reason it wasn't used in the g-2 paper is that at the time the most precise lattice quantum chromodynamics calculations were much less precise than the data-driven way (And it is quite difficult to simply combine their results) so it was neglected. However, very recently a lattice quantum chromodynamic calculation that has comparable precision to the data-driven method has been produced."

So our 6 dimensional space of quark states must be split in three 2D spaces, each being a 2-plet of weak SU(2), and each 2-plet being a generation of quarks. In each generation, you have two states called an up-type and a down-type state (weak isospin is respectively +1/2 and -1/2).  Now, you have lost your SU(6) symmetry (if you want to keep the 2-plets separated you cannot freely mix flavours) but you still have an SU(3) symmetry mixing the three generations. Surely a linear combination of SU(2) 2-plet is an SU(2) 2-plet. That is, you can perform simultaneous rotations of the 3 up type quarks and the 3 down type quarks.  Now when mass pops back up you have a problem. Mass is a quadratic form on our 6D space, or even more explicitly a positive-definite, symmetric 6x6 mass matrix which has no reason to be diagonal and we are interested on diagonalizing. Since we're only left with SU(3) symmetry, we cannot diagonalize a 6x6 matrix. **By convention**, we use the SU(3) symmetry to diagonalize the matrix on the up-type quarks. By this I mean we define u, c, t as the eigenstates of the mass matrix.  The mass matrix is *not* diagonal on the down-type quarks. After the SU(3) rotation that diagonalized the mass matrix, we have no symmetry left and to the three quarks u, c, t there's three down-like states associated by being in the same 2-tuplet, these are called d', s', b' and they are the so called weak eigenstates.  These do not have a definite mass as the mass matrix is not diagonal in the d', s', b' basis. However weak interactions are easy because u turns into d' and so on.  *If* you diagonalized the mass matrix on the down-type quarks you'd mess up the 2-plets but you'd get three quarks d,s,b with definite mass, the mass eigenstates. As the 2-plets are mixed, d could through weak interactions turn into any of u, c, t.  So d,s,b and d',s',b' are not the same states, but they're connected by a rotation given by the CKM matrix. This matrix is very close, but not exactly equal, to a rotation by 13\u00b0 of d and s and the identity on b."

Let me rephrase: for some reason, without thinking about it at all, I associated expended energy with applying constant pressure through my hands for some amount of time. My brain decided that pushing a 100kg motorcycle with a force of 100N for one second expends the same energy as pushing a 1 ton car with a force of 100N for one second.

It's especially difficult because of the way our muscles operate: if we just hold a heavy object stationary in our arms, we exert a force without causing displacement so no work is done on the object.  But within our muscles, individual cells and proteins are twitching and relaxing: work is being done at a micro-level and we end up feeling exhausted.  I think a good demonstration of what work feels like is the difference between walking on flat pavement vs going up a hill vs walking on loose sand.  Most healthy people can walk on flat hard ground for miles without too much trouble: our feet apply a vertical force against the ground, but since there's no vertical displacement almost no work is done.  On the other hand, if we walk up a hill, we achieve some vertical displacement with each step, so we do work and we get exhausted.  Similarly, when walking on sand it sinks under our feet, and that vertical displacement again means work is done.  (When I was a kid growing up in Hawaii, our soccer coach would sometimes have us practice on the beach.  He phrased it as if it was a fun special treat, but we quickly learned that running on sand is totally exhausting.)  Anyway, if your heart's racing and you're gasping for breath, you probably did some work.  But sometimes the work you did was only within your own muscle cells, with no visible results."

Likewise, you can generate a current with a changing magnetic field.   At the atomic level, electrons are magnetic dipoles. The combinations of these electrons determine if the atoms are magnetic and ultimately if the material itself is magnetic (of course, this is a massive oversimplification, but it's a simple way to get the idea). That is, magnetism is itself a phenomena that happens at a fundamental level, much like the attraction of charges.   \"Electricity\" on the other hand is harder to pinpoint because it's not one thing.

The strength of gravity felt by some small mass inside the star is zero at the center and rises linearly toward the edge; this is because the gravitational force from the mass on one side cancels out some of the force from the mass on the other side. Outside the star, the strength of gravity falls according to the usual inverse-square law. This means that the maximum strength of gravity you could experience is at the star's surface:  F = G\\*M\\*m/R\\^2  where R is on the order of the radius of the star.  Let's very roughly model a black hole as a point mass. The force of gravity from a point mass always follows the inverse-square law:  F = G\\*M\\*m/r\\^2  for any distance r. So, for any r<R, the strength of gravity near a black hole is stronger than the strength of gravity inside a star of the same mass, simply because the black hole is much more dense, which prevents the cancellation we saw inside the star from happening in this case."

                "content": " This is a great question, and not an easy one.  TLDR: **roughly half a million years**.  The basic thermal energy balance equation for a planet's atmosphere is:  (Rate of change of thermal energy) = (Sunlight in) - (Infrared out)  For a stable climate the left side is zero and the two terms on the right balance, but not in this case.  The rate of change of thermal energy is given by the heat capacity of the atmosphere:  Rate of change of thermal energy = M Cp dT/dt  where M is the mass of the atmosphere, Cp is its specific heat capacity, and dT/dt is the rate of change of temperature.  Since the vast majority of the mass of the atmosphere is near the surface, we're just going to use the surface temperature, T = T_s.  For the infrared out term, the Stefan-Boltzmann law applies:  Infrared out = sigma A (T_e)^4  where sigma is the S-B constant, A is the surface area of the planet, and T_e is its *emission temperature*.  This is *not* the surface temperature: because of Venus's strong greenhouse effect, infrared energy from the surface is absorbed by the atmosphere before it escapes to space, and it's the colder atmosphere higher up that actually emits to space.  For Earth T_s and T_e differ by 10% or so on the Kelvin scale, but Venus's greenhouse effect is so huge that T_s = 700 Kelvin, T_e = 184 Kelvin -- a factor of 3.8.  Let's call this factor gamma = T_s / T_e.  Because this effect depends mostly on the *mass of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere*, I'm going to assume for now that this factor stays the same as the atmosphere starts to cool.  So now we've got a differential equation we can solve:  M Cp dT_s / dt = - sigma A (T_s)^4  / gamma^4  dT_s / dt = - sigma A / (M Cp gamma^4 )] (T_s)^4  Notice how Venus's large greenhouse effect (big gamma) and large mass M really slow down the cooling rate compared to Earth.  For Venus:  sigma = 5.67e-8 W m^2 K^4  A  = 4.6e14 m^2  M = [5e20 kg  Cp = 843 J/(kg K) for CO2  gamma = 3.8  Here's a plot of the solution to that differential equation, starting at T_s = 700 K:  https://imgur.com/tSGdcWu  You can see that Venus cools to Earthlike temperatures over half a million years or so.  But there's a problem with my calculation: at some point in this process, parts of the atmosphere are going to hit the freezing point of CO2.  Dry ice clouds will form, dry ice snow will start to fall.  This causes a bunch of problems: on the one hand, it reduces the amount of gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect, so my assumption that \"gamma\" was constant will stop being true.  On the other hand, freezing a substance releases energy, which needs to be accounted for in my differential equation.  The first effect shortens the cooling time, the second one lengthens it.  But the equation above at least predicts that it'll be hundreds of thousands of years before Venus even gets to the point where freezing CO2 becomes an issue.  Oh, and this is just the time to cool the atmosphere itself.  The upper part of the rocky crust also needs to cool, which will lengthen the cooling time even more.  You can find much more on the energy balance of planets, including this dry ice snow issue, in Principles of Planetary Climate by Pierrehumbert.

                "content": " Yeah, most antennas are just a piece of metal.  The shape is the most important part.  Some antennas (lots, actually) have other materials in them as well, and I'll mention that after.  So: an EM wave is basically a voltage traveling through the air at the speed of light.  That's pretty unintuitive, but it becomes more obvious when you think about it.  If you could freeze time and measure the voltage (from the EM field) at any one spot, you could follow an EM wave by watching the voltage go up and down.  Now freeze time around an antenna.  Picture a normal car whip antenna, just a wire sticking straight up.  The antenna is inside the wave, and takes on that voltage.  The voltage goes up and down as the wave passes, so electrons are sucked into and out of the antenna.    The next simplest antenna is a dipole.  The voltage induced in the antenna is the red curve that moves up and down.  See how it causes electrons to flow back and forth across the resistor?  A radio measures that flow.  All the antenna does is produce that flow.  It's up to the radio to measure and amplify that flow.  In fact the antenna doesn't even provide the resistor- it's up to the radio to have the right resistance, and match exactly what the antenna is tuned to expect.  Normally this is 50 ohms.  The reason why is complicated, which is to say people argue about it a *lot*.  So, if the antenna was too big, or the wrong shape, or facing the wrong way, it might end up overlapping another part of the wave.  If that happened, electrons would flow between that part of the antenna and the other part instead of through the resistor, and you wouldn't be able to measure anything.  That's why metal heats up in a microwave.  Microwaves use very similar frequencies to a household router, but are hundreds or thousands of times more powerful.  When you expose a fork to that, it sits over a couple different waves at the same time- so the middle may be at -5 V, while the forks and handle are at +5V.  Because metal has such a low resistance (WAY lower than water), that low voltage can still cause a LOT of current to flow, and the fork gets very hot.  This is even more complicated than it sounds, and you can also get *high* voltages in this situation- those cause sparks.]  Modern antennas take advantage of that fact by carefully designing antennas to not cancel out.  You can only measure so much of the wave before it passes, so they cheat and measure several parts of the wave at once- each time removing a as much energy as possible, without cancelling anything out.  [Yagi-Uda antennas are one of the most commonly-seen antennas, and work basically like this Note: many people will call this a lie.  They are mostly right, but its a decent explanation anyways.]  Yagis are one of the special antennas- some of the cross-wires are electrically insulated, and only serve to reflect EM waves- exactly like the dish on a [parabolic antenna.  Incidentally, parabolic antennas work exactly like you would think they do.  Now we're getting into the really weird antennas.  Some of them used to be really common, and some still are, but antennas nowadays are mostly just metal shapes- we got a lot better at making them very sneaky.  Cell phone antennas, and famously iphone antennas, are often built into the metal chassis- you can see where each end is insulated from the rest of the chassis.  One extremely popular and now totally obsolete antenna is the ferrite loop.  These were used for AM radio, which is a much lower frequency than WiFi, cellular or even FM.  Lower frequency means longer wavelength- more distance between the high and low voltages.  For medium-wave Heard of shortwave?  Same idea.] that distance can be hundreds of meters, and you can't hope to make an antenna that long.  Ferrite loop antennas wrapped dozens of meters (or more!) of wire around a [ferrite rod.  The ferrite acts like a funnel for EM waves, increasing the antennas sensitivity by a huge amount.  You know how you can pick up a bunch of paperclips with a magnet?  Same deal.  Each paperclip funnels the magnetic field through itself, so it's still strong when it reaches the other end and weaker right beside the paperclip.  The ferrite loop antenna works the exact same way.  Helical antennas are another weird one: they're extremely directional, kind of like a laser for EM waves.  Usually used to track satellites, since they can be hundreds or thousands of miles away, and transmit at low power compared to earth transmitters.  Now, these things are black magic, but given the basics you can at least see *why* they work if not exactly how.  The magnetic field at different places on the helix is different, and reinforces or cancels itself out.  If the wave comes from a different direction, different spots will be cancelling.    Every bit of metal on earth acts like a little antenna, but if they aren't plugged into a radio you'd never notice.  For the most part they just absorb waves and immediately emit them back.  If the wave is much bigger than the metal, the whole object will be at the same voltage and no electricity will flow inside it.  For big metal things, electricity may flow inside them, but not enough to matter.  > In a radio, we can listen to the DJ, but how are we able to hear so audibly when the audio message is sent through radiowaves or microwaves?  Math, mostly.  AM radio is the simplest: sound controls whether or not the transmitter is on.  So when the sound wave is high, the transmitter is busily sending lots of waves out the antenna.  When its low, the transmitter turns off.  Your car radio receives those waves and turns them into another on-off signal, and uses that to control the speakers.  The exact way you do it is called envelope detection.  There are a lot of ways to do this.  One way is to use a rectifier, which is a device that turns AC waves into DC.  When the rectifier is fed fully-on 800 kHz radio, it outputs, say, ~3 V.  When it's not getting any waves it outputs 0 V.  That signal is fed from the rectifier through an audio amplifier that increases the voltage to 10+ volts and sends it to your speakers.  FM radio is ~~worse~~ more complicated.  *Hella* complicated.  So goddamn complicated we don't totally understand some things about it- like, when you lose reception on a station, why does it go from clear to static so fast?  Why doesn't the static slowly increase?  It's called the lock-on effect, but most of the reason is that the way you hear sound is weird: loud noises all sound about the same volume while quiet noises sound VERY quiet.  That's why sound is in dB (Decibels) instead of Pascals.]  Anyway, FM (Frequency Modulated) means that instead to the transmitter turning on or off, the frequency of the transmitter gets higher or lower.  Radios are very clever and can translate that very easily, and even use it to tune to stations automatically.  WiFi, cellular, and all digital radio (including the way that FM radio stations can transmit the station name, song title and artist) are all much more complex.  I could go on for hours about just [fountain codes.  The folks who do things like this have long beards (mandatory for the women too), fancy degrees and pointy hats with wide brims.  They are to be treated with respect and discouraged from talking.  Once they start going it sounds like they're casting a spell [sleep, usually]."

But the lava flow will lose heat so quickly at its margins, generally it will not be able to melt other rocks). Alteration of the substrate (i.e. some amount of physical erosion, breaking up of the material from boiling of fluids, 'baking' previously unlithified sediments/soils) is very common. The wikipedia article on lava provides a little description. The base of the lava flow itself also is affected by contact with a much cooler substrate. The portions of the lava in direct contact will start to solidify (and these bits will have a very fine grained texture because they cool quickly) but the interior is still hot enough to remain liquid and so the flow continues, which will tend to rip up these partially cooled bits and drag them along (with the cooling process continuing for new bits of lava that come into direct contact with the cool substrate). This can end up leaving the base of the flow with a brecciated texture (but this is again for the volcanic material itself, not the substrate). There are lots of places where we can observe cross sections of volcanic stratigraphy to get a view of the variety of the basal contacts of lava flows.

                "content": " The easy answer is no. If you mean combustion (or burning) of the bread, then there would be less calories because once combustion occurs (even partial) the byproducts are either indigestible or barely so.   If you mean dark toast, the kind you might get at 6 on the toaster, it has the same calories. The Maillard reaction is what drives browning and it is a complex process where proteins denature and bind to other proteins as well as carbohydrates and so forth created an amalgam of mixed molecules. Essentially this is what leads to that caramel/nuttiness you get when things are browned. However, this conformational change and denaturation does not decrease the calories because the overall building blocks are the same and still digestible.  However, if let\u2019s say a byproduct of a Maillard reaction is an indigestible molecule that was previously digestible, you could argue that it is now lower in caloric value because it is no longer bioavailable energy.   Side note, a lot of people are talking about measuring calories by using a bomb calorimeter aka burning the item. This is no longer the method used for finding caloric value of food. Instead they find the net average of Atwater bioavailable nutrients and then use standardized values (e.g. 4 Kcal/g for Carbohydrates) to calculate the assumed caloric value. Again, this is obviously dependent on bioavailable sources of energy, not overall stored energy.  A perfect example of how a bomb calorimeter is not a feasible option, is Lettuce. Excluding the water (which is 95% of the material) lettuce is primarily fiber. Insoluble fiber in this case or in other words fiber we cannot breakdown (Cellulose). This material has no caloric value to us because it is not bioavailable (aside from small amounts created by gut fermentation thanks to helpful bacteria). So a piece of lettuce has a net caloric value of basically 0 in the Atwater system. In a bomb calorimeter however, it might have a much higher value because inside each of those cellulose walled cells is stored sugars, proteins, and so forth. Additionally, cellulose is essentially a starch made up of Beta-Glucose, however Beta-glucose is in a different conformation than Alpha-Glucose in starches we digest which means it is incompatible with our enzymes. However, combustion wise, cellulose and amylose (Alpha-glucose polysaccharide aka starch to most people) are equivalent in \u201cCalories\u201d in the context of a bomb calorimeter.    Again, this is not the case in bioavailability. The only animals that can actually get the full caloric potential from plant material are foregut fermenters and hindgut fermenters, aka Cows and Horses. This is why they need multiple stomachs or a large cecum, in order to host helpful microorganisms to breakdown cellulose. Even Termites are not able to digest cellulose, but usually carry symbiotic organisms that can.   https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-food-manufacturers/  Addl. Note: /u/chuggsipas pointed out the fact that to be totally accurate about this discussion we have to really highlight that a Calorie at its base definition is the amount of energy required in order to raise one gram of water, by one degree Celsius. It\u2019s important to distinguish this because while I do mention that a bomb calorimeter is not used for nutritional labeling values, it is the correct way to calculate calories in its true context. Another thing chugg brought up, and I absolutely agree with, is the fact that nutritional calories are a terrible measure of how our body uses energy. We do not just ingest and combust whatever is bioavailable, there are a multitude of processes that are dedicated to metabolism, storage, availability, etc that are not taken into account by flat caloric values. In fact evidence builds every year that quality of foods and caloric sources are more important than the overall calorie value. However, on some very basic level you can get a vague idea of your energy intake with the Atwater calorie system.   Edit: Added some clarification in regards to glucose in Cellulose.  Edit2: Fucked up and did L/D-Glucose instead of Alpha/Beta. Corrected that :X   Edit 3: Just wanted to say thank you to anyone who challenged or questioned anything I wrote. I definitely needed to add some information and make changes here and there. I appreciate it, especially since that\u2019s what healthy discussion is about, and no one can be 100% correct, 100% of the time without some input from others!"

Hello altogether,  unfortunately I have many different questions about all things fat and protein digestion, specifically regarding animal products with different fat content.  I want to understand the science and the chemistry behind the whole topic and also educate myself even further because it seems like I know nothing.  I tried to do some \u201eresearch\u201c and found several different claims, opinions and explanations.  Before I get into the questions, I want to present the claims from the two different \u201ecamps\u201c because obviously there are more schools of thought?!  **Team fatty meat/protein:**  *The more fat that is in the protein the more delayed is digestion and therefore it sits in the small intestine longer and the required enzymes have more time to do their work and help digest the protein and the fat more efficiently, fully and easier! If the protein is leaner it goes to the digestive tract much faster, probably undigested and not fully absorbed by the small intestine.*  *Muscle meats like chicken breast or lean steak can aggravate constipation and therefore its beneficial to replace them with gelatinous meats instead and cuts with more soft tissue like chicken thighs, fatty meats etc. Humans can only use meat fibers properly when they come with fat, collagen and other substances.*  *Dark meat like chicken thighs or fatty cuts of meat contain more nutrients like zinc, iron and more vitamins like b12 additional folate, pantothenic acid, selenium, phosphorous, and vitamins K and A which aids in digestion.*  **Team lean meat/protein:**  *Meats with higher fat content take longer to digest. Also, foods with the least amount of fat, least amount connective tissues, and shorter muscle fibers are easier to digest. It means that fish is the easiest meat to digest, then poultry, pork and lastly beef*  *it also means that if the piece of chicken or turkey you are eating has more fat or long muscle fibers (thighs or drumsticks) than a LEAN piece of steak or a LEAN cut of pork, then that piece of chicken will be harder to digest!*  *A piece of boneless skinless chicken breast is easier to digest than a chicken thigh. Lean ground beef (93/7) is easier to digest than fattier ground beef (80/20) and a lean filet is easier to digest than a ribeye or beef brisket, chick etc.*  Ok, so far so good and I\u2019m confused.  What I found is a study about myoglobin and it seems like that dark meat or cuts of poultry and beef with more myoglobin and more connective tissue are \u201eharder\u201c to digest than white meat or poultry/beef with less myoglobin!?  **My questions are:**  What sits longer in the stomach, how long and why?  What sits longer in the small intestine, how long and why?  What kind of poultry/meat moves faster through the digestive tract, especially through the small intestine?  Which cuts require more effort, more enzymes, more stomach acid?  Which cuts are more taxing on the liver?  Is it easier and quicker for the small intestine to absorb nutrients from lean or fatty protein and why?  which factor determines whether a piece of animal protein/fat is light or heavy, fast or slow digesting when looking at the fat/food in isolation. Is it the fat content, connective tissue, a combination?  Is a fatty ribeye or hamburger patty (70/30 or 80/20) easier to digest than a lean filet steak? Or a fatty chicken thigh easier than a chicken breast? Pretend that all meats/beef/poultry are cooked to a moist internal temperature, not overcooked, tough or dry  Are low fat dairy products easier and quicker to digest than full fat dairy products?  At the end of the day I want to know which cuts of poultry/meat/beef/fish are easier to digest for the stomach and small intestine and which cuts are moving faster through the digestive tract. Also from which cuts the small intestine can easier absorb nutrients?  Im looking for a evidence based scientific answers in plain English that I can understand what\u2019s going on and why. I don\u2019t need study\u2019s, although it would be nice, but everything backed up with science based explanations and evidence not opinions or preferences like almost everything on YouTube, food blogs etc. I\u2019m looking for people who study this stuff or work in this field and know what they talking about.  Im very thankful for every explanation, help and for everyone who reads this.  I appreciate every Tipp where and how I can educate myself because I don\u2019t want to be lazy.  Thank you very much and have a great day\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " GI physiologist here: absorption of food stuffs depends entirely on chemical composition of the food.  The food must move from the lumen of the gi tract across the walls of the cells lining the the small  intestine and thence into the bloodstream.  The cell walls are composed of lipid (fat), thus only fats can cross the cell wall unassisted. The fats that you eat are too big - both physically too big (must be crushed into smaller pieces) and chemically too big (must be broken down into it's component parts by the action of enzymes coming from the pancreas and/or stomach wall) to cross the cell wall in the form in which they are eaten.  The breakdown from big hunks to small hunks occurs in the stomach due to repeated gastric contractions squashing the food and mixing it with the various gi secretions of saliva, acid and some enzymes.  If the fat is not broken down sufficiently it can't be attacked by the enzymes because they are water soluble and can not fight their way through a big hunk of fat. This process requires time not required for non-fat foods so fats stay in the stomach longer than non-fats if eaten separately.  It eaten together, everything is slowed down in the stomach.  Once the fats are sufficiently broken down physically they pass into the small intestine where more enzymes finish the chemical breakdown into components small enough to pass through the lipid cell walls.  Unfortunately, at this point the fatty particles are floating in the aqueous secretions of the stomach and small intestine and can not reach the lipid cell wall.  To make matters worse there is also a layer of water bound to the lining of the small intestine which also blocks movement of the fat components.  This is where bile comes into the picture.  Molecules of bile are water soluble on one end and fat soluble on the other so they form into little tiny hollow balls with the fatty ends pointing into the center of the ball.  As they form, the fatty food components are trapped inside the ball.  The water soluble ends are pointing out from the ball so the entire ball is now water soluble.  These balls (micelles) move through all the water and water layers and dump the fatty components directly on the cell walls where they can now pass through the wall into the cell.  To pass from inside the cell out the back side into the blood the fatty components must form another hollow ball with the fatty material inside and proteins outside which allows the fatty material to move around in the blood once it is absorbed.  Last but not least the fatty material moves from the small intestinal cells into the lymph not directly into the bloodstream where it must end up to be used for fuel.  Thus it travels through the lymph system until it reaches the thoracic duct where it is dumped into the bloodstream.  Obviously, fat digestion is a complex time- consuming process with many steps all of which must happen in the correct order.  Malabsorption of fat is quite common and causes smelly diarrhea.  Proteins are water soluble and special carriers exist in the walls of cells allowing amino acids to be transported into and out of the cells so the process of protein digestion and absorption is simple and rapid.  Eat the protein, proteases secreted by the mouth, stomach and pancreas begin to break down the proteins into constituent amino acids.  These move directly into the small intestine where they bind to the carriers on the cell walls and viola, absorption.  Malabsorption of proteins is rare and usually involves a congenitally missing carrier.  Complete digestion and absorption of a high fat meal may take several hours longer than that of low fat meal."

In short, this is probably beyond the limits of our current understanding of neuroscience, but we have some guesses.  When people have lesions in the dominant temporal lobe they have trouble with recognising or linking the meanings of sounds and words. There is an equivalent semantic agnosis for some kinds of visual stimuli usually associated with lesions in the parietal lobe. In general, the brain tends to infer a pattern that explains disparate stimuli. The term for this is \"gestalt\". This is a high level function that is quite sensitive to lesional disruption - see The Man Who Mistook Hos Wife for a Hat for examples.  Semantic content in auditory stimuli, processed by the temporal lobe, is far more temporally dependent than other stimuli. Note that the term 'temporal' is shared between the lobe and the nature of it's processing is purely coincidental - it was named for the tendency of the hair of the overlying scalp to gray, showing age, before other areas of hair.  In any case, when the temporal lobe receives a segment of data that activates a specific semantic 'gestalt', it likely continues to seek confirmation of that 'gestalt'. For smells or tactile senses, or visual stimuli, it's simpler, because you just sniff or feel more, or double take. For songs, the new stimuli only adds to the gestalt if it occurs in a specific temporal sequence. As such, you need to continue the tune, either in your head, by humming, or listening to the song.

Plus, low visibility at the summit is pretty dangerous for navigation, and is typically accompanied by other hazardous conditions such as strong winds, cold temperatures, and, yes, snow.  9000 meters/30,000 feet is fairly low on the scale of the atmosphere. Weather only really occurs in the troposphere, which is the lowest and thinnest *(in terms of width: its the thickest in terms of density) layer of the atmosphere, but still extends way higher than this. At Everest's latitude, the tropopause (where the troposphere ends and clouds can't extend much higher) is around 16 km (52000 ft) up: in other words, clouds can extend close to twice as high as Everest's summit. While clouds are usually lower than that, it therefore shouldn't be a surprise that the summit sees snow on a fairly regular basis, especially in the summer storm season, which is directly related to why almost no one climbs the mountain in summer."

This combination of mutations hasn\u2019t been seen before, although a combination of similar mutations (E484K and N501Y) is found on the B1.135/South African variant and the P.1/Brazilian variant (the South African variant has some other mutations on it too that make it particularly resistant to antibodies).  It\u2019s worth noting that the South African variant actually already has 3 mutations on the RBD as well, technically also making it a \u201ctriple mutant\u201d. For some reason some media outlets decided to start calling this variant from India a double mutant, and then people just ran with it, irresponsibly might I add.

This has gone on for too long, and it's time for lasting change.   When 1 out of every 1,000 black men and boys in the United States can expect to be killed by the police, police violence is a public health crisis. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. In 2019, 1,099 people were killed by police in the US; 24% of those were black, even though only 13% of the population is black.  When black Americans make up a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths, healthcare disparity is another public health crisis. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of COVID-19 deaths. In Louisiana, black people are 33% of the population but account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs, with 38% of black workers employed in these industries compared with 29% of white workers. They are less likely to have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in medical care.  These disparities, these crises, are not coincidental. They are the result of systemic racism, economic inequality, and oppression.   Change requires us to look inward, too. For over a decade, AskScience has been a forum where redditors can discuss scientific topics with scientists. Our panel includes hundreds of STEM professionals who volunteer their time, and we are proud to be an interface between scientists and non-scientists. We are fully committed to making science more accessible, and we hope it inspires people to consider careers in STEM.   However, we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of diversity. In the US, black workers comprise 11% of the US workforce, but hold just 7% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. Only 4% of medical doctors are black. Hispanic workers make up 16% of the US workforce, 6% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, and 4.4% of medical doctors. Women make up 47% of the US workforce but 41% of STEM professionals with professional or doctoral degrees. And while we know around 3.5% of the US workforce identifies as LGBTQ+, their representation in STEM fields is largely unknown.  These numbers become even more dismal in certain disciplines. For example, as of 2019, less than 4% of tenured or tenure-track geoscience positions are held by people of color, and fewer than 100 black women in the US have received PhDs in physics.  This lack of diversity is unacceptable and actively harmful, both to people who are not afforded opportunities they deserve and to the STEM community as a whole. We cannot truly say we have cultivated the best and brightest in our respective fields when we are missing the voices of talented, brilliant people who are held back by widespread racism, sexism, and homophobia.  It is up to us to confront these systemic injustices directly. We must all stand together against police violence, racism, and economic, social, and environmental inequality. STEM professional need to make sure underrepresented voices are heard, to listen, and to offer support. We must be the change.   -----  **Sources:**  - https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793 - https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/ - https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/rounds/racial-disparities-time-of-covid-19 - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK24693/ - https://www.joincampaignzero.org/research - https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/black-workers-coronavirus-covid-19 - https://www.npr.org/transcripts/867466515 - https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/diversity-in-the-stem-workforce-varies-widely-across-jobs/ - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0519-z - https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.3.20190529a/full/ - https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/09/11/even-progressive-academics-can-be-racist-ive-experienced-it-firsthand/ - http://www.bu.edu/articles/2017/lgbt-issues-stem-diversity/\n\nAssistant:"

It's no secret that within the US, the Latino and Black communities tend to be among the most impoverished with the lowest high school graduation rates, worst test scores and lowest that go on to higher education. How do you break that cycle that has middle and high school aged kids spend the time to take their studies serious and want to graduate and go on for further education?  Compare that to your suburban areas that are primarily white, Asian and Indian, most kids do graduate high school and a decent percentage do go on to 4+ year degrees.   As far as looking at those percentages, 29.7% of native born white citizens go on to earn a Bachelor's versus 16.3% of the black population (both of which pale in comparison to the 48.3% that the Asian population has).   Your stats of 11% of the workforce is made up of the black population whereas only 7% of STEM jobs are held -- that actually falls in line with the disparity of the degree earning differences.   Maybe the answer isn't forcing more diversity out of the current adult population, but to work on getting those kids who are in poor schools to prioritize their education and future and have a community that surrounds them to better support and encourage them."

I just enrolled at a famous academy of magic, you probably know it. It has a great reputation, but it's a mad house. The place is completely insane. It should be closed down immediately or at least the administration should be fired and replaced.  Some friends snuck out after dark, but one of the other students snitched and they got detention. I thought they'd have to stay in class after school let out, but instead they sent them into a dark forest, in the middle of the night, to find someone who had killed a unicorn. That's crazy and dangerous.  Just walking around inside of school is a hazard, there are stairways that keep moving--some kid from math class already fell to his death and was crushed.  Right from the beginning I knew there would be trouble, they put a magic hat on your head to pick your dorm, but everyone has to wear it and they don't wash it. It smells, it's sweaty, and the last dozen kids now have lice. Three dorms have cool names, but I'm stuck in the dorm named after a muppet.  The janitor hates us and advocates torture, the groundskeeper is a nice guy, but totally inappropriate in his behavior. We were given flight lessons, but with no helmets or protective gear, and then the instructor left us alone and all hell broke loose.  There's no security at all, there are monsters and ghosts just wandering everywhere. There's a girl ghost that hangs out in the boys' bathroom, it's really perverted but they won't do anything about it.  Some students found out that someone was in the school trying to steal some magic rock and told the vice principal but she didn't care and just dismissed them, then they nearly got killed. The VP is still there, nobody cares. The principal is never around, he's always off doing something more important.  There are all these animals in school, kids are getting bird flu from the owls, the plague from the rats, and there's a group that hangs out in the tower licking toads. I was eating lunch the other day and a bunch of messenger owls flew in and started crapping all over the food. It's really disgusting.  My language teacher is just making stuff up, she's completely unqualified. I don't even think it's real Latin, just gibberish.  I went to watch a sporting event, some game I couldn't even follow, and kids were being injured so badly they had to be hospitalized. There's a guy in my dorm who's had a few concussions already, his handwriting is barely legible now and he can't remember things. The teachers don't care, they keep giving him good grades even though you can see his hands shake when he holds his wand.  There's a weird kid in the other dorm who's always getting into trouble, but they don't care. I heard he's from an abusive foster family and is forced to live in a closet, maybe that's why. They should really get him into a better home and find a therapist for him so he stops acting out.  The favoritism is really out of hand, all year long there's a competition for which dorm is going to get the most points and at the last minute the principal showed up, started handing out bogus points, and arbitrarily decided that his favorite dorm should win.  Finally, they have all these elves enslaved at the school. They tell us the elves want to be there, working long hours in bad conditions, but I can't believe that's true. The elves have been beaten down so much that they claim they love the school and don't want their freedom, it's pitiful.  I've been writing letters home to my parents, but they're convinced I'm exaggerating things and don't believe me. I want to report the school, but I've told that the ministry is quick to silence its critics, so I'm scared. There are spells to know if people are lying, but they keep locking up innocent people anyway; it's like a police state. I just want to go to a normal school, what can I do?\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " It depends. To begin: against the expectations of many, including criminologists, the Great Recession did not increase crime rates. In Rosenfeld's introduction to a special issue on the Crime and the Great Recession:  >**When the Great Recession hit in early 2008, it was widely assumed that crime rates would increase.** That was a reasonable expectation. **Robbery and property crime rates generally rise during recessions and fall during recoveries** (Bushway, Cook, & Phillips, 2013). **Some evidence suggests homicide and assault rates do as well** (Lauritsen & Heimer, 2010; Rosenfeld, 2009). **But the Great Recession was different. Crime rates fell in the United States and in most other developed nations hit by the financial collapse and recession.**  The short story is that the relationship between economic factors and crime is complex. We have to consider the big picture, but also remember that the devil is in the details, i.e.:  >... the possibility has been raised that] **the relationship between economic conditions and crime is not invariant; other factors influence it.**  ---  To expand further: [Rosenfeld in his 2013 book about Crime and the Economy argues:  >Despite ample indications that economic considerations may be a source of personal distress and criminal behaviour, **research on the relationship between crime and the economy tells a more complex story** ...]  >But **even the association between economic conditions and street crime turns out to be more complex than it first appears** [...]  >In an example [of moderating factors] from our own research, **we presented evidence that the relationship between unemployment and burglary is moderated by the strength of the welfare state.**  [In another 2013 book - Economics and Youth Violence - Baumer, Rosenfeld and Wolff ask whether \"...] the Criminogenic Consequences of Economic Downturns [are] Conditional?\":  >**Much of the extant research on the link between indicators of economic downturns and crime rates has focused on estimating main effects**, typically evaluating the general hypothesis that declining economic conditions yield elevated crime rates. **We propose that this was an overly simplistic approach.**  >[...] one clear conclusion that emerges from our study is that **the relationship between economic conditions and crime rates is complex. Simple assessments of the link between macroeconomic conditions and crime rates are likely to yield misleading results**  Thus, for example, the effect of unemployment depends on inflation rates;  >These findings underscore the general **need to consider conditional relationships when assessing the role of economic conditions on crime** and to **challenge simplistic views of the implications for crime levels of significant economic downturns such as the most recent recession, which has thus far been accompanied by relatively low levels of inflation and therefore may not yield substantial increases in crime, even with a doubling of the unemployment rate in many areas.**  ---  Therefore, it is important to consider mediating and moderating factors (e.g. the context and all which comes with!) and it is valuable to consider cross-national studies. For illustration, see the following three studies. Per [Lauritsen et al.'s analysis of the relationship between violence and economic conditions in the USA between 1973 and 2011:  >As our findings show, **relationships between economic conditions and violence are affected by historical context and therefore subject to change, both in the most recent period and of course in the future.**   In 2012 edition of *Criminology in Europe* - the official newsletter of the European Society of Criminology - Rodriguez and Larrauri conclude in regard to **Spain**:  >Our data reflect trends only until 2010. **According to these data, most violent and property crime rates did not increase during the recession.** Why these types of crimes did not increase **might have to do with sociodemographic changes, with the persistence of the welfare state in Spain, or with other related factors that require additional research.** Whether this decrease will continue in the future is hard to predict.  And per Xenakis and Cheliotis's review of research on **Greece**:  >As suggested by this brief review, **the relationship between crime and the financial crisis in Greece has been non-linear, irregular, and complex**.  To quote a paper they published in 2013:  >Second, **the criminogenic impact of financial crisis may lack linearity and uniformity, not just in terms of common property and violent offences and white-collar crime, as previous research has suggested, but also as regards illicit political violence.** In the Greek case, whilst illicit violence identified as emanating from far-left or anarchist groups initially rose but then fell, mass public unrest did not gather momentum, and violence perpetrated by the police and far-right groups saw an ascent."

I don't know how to prove the negative with a citation, so I'll just link here to a google scholar search with some likely terms: I'm very open to being wrong about this, but I don't know of literature actually studying the question of whether introverts are the systematic target of prejudice or discrimination or negative stereotyping.   That said, and knowing I might be wrong, there's certainly a lot of assuming that \"introverts\" are a marginalized class of individuals. The word is in quotes because introversion is a dimensional personality trait, not a set of categories. I don't know if there is epidemiology-type research showing some kind of clustering of correlates or outcomes or something that would strengthen the case for the existence of a discrete group of people identified as \"introverts\" (there might be), so I continue to think in dimensional terms: there are some people very high on the introversion personality trait. There are also people medium-high, less high, etc.  But lots of writers of scholarly and quasi-scholarly literature insist that introverts are marginalized, in some cases apparently suggesting that the marginalization processes are similar to those studied in sexism and racism research.  My problems with this are threefold:  **1.** I don't know of any research demonstrating an overall bias against \"introverts\" (I know the public might perceive a discrete group of people even though science doesn't seem to, so this is still a real possibility; I just don't know of the research).  **2.** The somewhat defensive defenses of \"introverts\" I have seen/read/survived at conferences have all made the apparently solid observations that North Americans/Western Europeans have many socially positive prototypes, myths, figures of speech, etc. associated with the characteristics of extroversion, with implied denigration of those characteristic of introversion. These authors also point out (probably quite accurately) that there are many activities in our meta-society that are easier for extroverts than for introverts, such as those requiring public speaking, aggressive socializing, daily assertiveness, etc. While these points seem to make lots of sense, they ignore some things, like...  (a) ...the fact that our societies also have many positive things to say about introvert traits, with negative things to say about extroverts (\"Speak softly and carry a big stick,\" \"Still waters run deep,\" \"If you can't say anything nice...\" \"just flapping his gums,\" \"running her mouth,\" \"babbling brooks,\" \"Quiet people have the loudest minds,\" etc.) that imply the opposite of the persecuted-introvert hypothesis. Look at any list of \"quotes about introverts\" and see how many are critical of introvert-typical behavior. There are any number of literary or Hollywood heroes/heroines who are introverts (Introversion fits well with the \"quiet/demure\" part of traditional female gender roles, as well as with the \"strong, silent\" male gender role--go count the number of action heroes who appear to just love parties and chitchat) and these characters are often portrayed as patiently suffering the extrovert fools around them.   (b) ...logically, the existence of an easier pathway for success with some characteristics than others does not necessarily imply prejudice, much less active discrimination; physically stronger people pass firefighter exams more easily, but that doesn't mean the rest of us are a bunch of anti-weak-people bigots. People with high levels of psychopathy (and correspondingly low levels of empathy) have an easier time making loads of money as CEOs or corporate lawyers, but this doesn't mean everyone carries some anti-nice-person prejudice.  **3.** The \"takedowns\" of extroversion are all kind of holier-than-thou. Okay, maybe I'm the defensive one, now; I have never been described as an introvert, so that's a possibility. However, just read/listen to/watch a few of these, and I think you'll agree that the tone is often one of superiority; it's not just that introverts are a persecuted class of people who are just as good as anyone else; the injustice is so much worse because introverts are *better* than other people, and those other people don't recognize that fact! If the extroverts would just stop talking for a few minutes, or stay home and read a book or two, or leave the friggin' party early, maybe they could become smart, insightful, and truly independent, too! And finally recognize that the introverts in their lives have always been better at these things! Some of these pieces are much less like this than others, I realize; some are quite reasonable, and point out important ways in which we seem to have structured our world to prioritize certain interpersonal strategies over others, with bad consequences. It's telling that there is a micro-industry in celebrating introversion in the US right now. Actually, googling \"quotes about introverts\" and \"sayings about talking,\" etc. I'm becoming convinced that this isn't new; perhaps we've been bemoaning the unfair dominance of extrovert traits for centuries.  **4.** People have experiences. Those experiences are real. They cause suffering. They are compelling. We are behavioral scientists, and these facts do not mean that we instantly accept those people's accounts of the *causality* of those experiences. If the \"introverts\" of the world are convinced they are experiencing systematic oppression (trying to use a feminist definition of that term), this could be due to systematic bias and discriminatory behavior, or probably other things. For one thing, nearly *everyone* feels they are socially disconnected and disadvantaged; it's one of the most common human experiences to feel that you aren't really a full member of your community, that you aren't as respected or appreciated as you'd like, that your intimate relationships aren't as close or authentic as you wish they were, etc. Another possibility is that people with lots of introversion are more likely to have self-fulfilling prophecy effects, in which their discomfort in certain social situations leads to other people behaving in ways they perceive as threatening or marginalizing, and around and around. More possibilities will surely have been considered by smarter people than I. In any case, one common thread in the \"introverts unite\" treatises I've seen is a complete lack of any meaningful null hypothesis. Well, there are lots of them, and hey, science.  So before we start answering the question of where anti-introvert prejudice comes from, let's get some data: is it even a thing? Lots of armchair philosophers think it is, and lots of people who cherry-pick cultural tidbits seem to conclude that it is, but I suspect the reality is more mixed. American culture, at least (I'm American, and most of the pro-introvert content I've seen is also American), has always had a mix of celebrating and demonizing both extroversion-typical and introversion-typical behaviors (I didn't mention it above, but \"deranged loner\" is the media flip-side of \"strong, silent type\", so yeah, our world has some nasty things to say about introverts, too, sometimes). I suspect that any research out there (I'm assuming there is some... how could there not be?) finds something other than a simple anti-introvert prejudice construct if it asks reasonably balanced sets of questions. I don't think this will be structured much like racist, anti-gay, sexist, or even anti-political-leanings kinds of prejudice at all.  TL;DR: Hold your horses. Let's find out if anti-introvert discrimination is a thing before we start trying to explain it.  *Edit (24 hours later)*: IDK if I can trust reddit's vote count, but this one has zigzagged up and down between about 15 and 3. Heh. Only one actual comment, of course, but I assume some people are annoyed that I have questioned the Introvert Orthodoxy. So be it. If it can't stand scrutiny, then it's a a bad idea."

They suggest that, in one year, the potential direct cost savings just from obstetrical or delivery costs was about $981,000. Additional direct cost savings might come from prenatal care, which they estimate could range from a $2.50 to $7 cost savings for each dollar invested in the program. They also mention that, since average birth costs were used, they may not reflect the additional costs that would be incurred by women undergoing Caesarean sections or caring for babies of low birthweight; costs in these cases are exponentially higher than in normal births, so cost savings would be commensurately higher.   The authors also mention a good study by Hoffman (2006) who found that early teen births reduce the lifetime earnings of the resulting children by about $810 per year, or about $35,000 over the course of a lifetime.   It's important to note that the sample size for this study is VERY small. Their data examine dependent minors, and the number of eligible women was obtained from the PEIA (Public Employees Insurance Agency); it's unclear whether the numbers are for all minor dependents in the state or just minor dependents covered by the PEIA itself. They also assumed a participation rate of 20% (that is, 20% of eligible dependent minors actually took contraception). Either way, their assumption was a sample size of 2,625. So these numbers reflect a VERY small sample population compared to a larger geographical area or a higher participation rate, and are probably conservative even for this small sample size.   Whether these numbers are directly applicable to a larger population is a bit unclear; for example, as they point out, costs vary widely depending on the ease of the birth, and the age of the parent is directly correlated with this (for example, minors are more likely to have babies of low birthweight, with commensurately high costs as mentioned above). However, most likely they're at least in the ballpark. At the very base of all this is the fact that contraception coverage is extremely cheap for insurers (dollars per person), whereas covering the birth, prenatal and post-natal care of a child costs in the thousands of dollars. The economics on that end is fairly simple."

Over long time horizons (20 years and more), the rate of inflation in consumer prices is correlated 1-for-1 with the rate of growth in the stock of money. See chart 1. Similarly, over long time horizons, the rate of growth of the money stock is independent of output. (See chart 2, same paper.)  One of the longest-running and most enduring propositions of macroeconomics is that inflation is a monetary phenomenon over longish time horizons, say 20 years or more. This idea goes all the way back to Hume, in 1752.  Over shorter horizons, 1-5 years, the sources of inflation (rather, the sources of fluctuation in the inflation rate) are more tricky, and not tied 1-for-1 with fluctuations in the money growth rate. The short-run dynamics of inflation and money growth deserve their own post. Inflation is neither good nor bad; similarly deflation is neither good nor bad, over long time horizons - they simply don't matter. Over shorter time horizons, whether inflation is good or bad, or deflation is good or bad, depends on the mix of shocks that the economy is facing.    > What would happen to a government if it simply stopped printing money?  Would inflation decrease, stop or even become deflation?   In the short run, that is, over the course of 1-4 years, there would be a recession. Output and prices would both fall. Over longer time horizons, prices would continue to fall and output would rise, until output was back on its trend path and prices were permanently below their old trend. If the money stock were fixed entirely, no more printing of money, the price level would probably gradually drift downward due to population growth and technical progress.   > Can a country plagued by hyperinflation solve it's problem by simply stopping the presses (and of course finding money in other ways)? Were there any period or government that tried this?  Yes. See: Paul Volker in 1981 for the most dramatic example.  > And if this is true, what caused inflation during the gold standard?   Oh, this is easy. Under a gold standard, the price level is just the inverse of the price of gold. Thus, fluctuations in the supply and demand for gold drove fluctuations in consumer price inflation.  An increase in the supply of of gold, all else equal, drives down the relative price of gold, which leads to inflation in consumer prices.   An increase in the demand for gold, all else equal, drives up the relative price of gold and leads to deflation in consumer prices. Thus, in bad times (recession), a flight to quality (towards gold) could lead to deflation in consumer prices. Just an example.  The other two scenarios (decrease in supply, decrease in demand) are similar.  Underneath this entire post is nothing more than a simple AD-AS diagram with upward-sloping SRAS, vertical LRAS, and MV=PY for AD."

It is best explained by a situational approach such as routine activities theory. For example, there are more opportunities for violent crime to occur during Summer because people are outside more often and thus interact more. Likewise, houses are emptier during Summer for the same reason, which creates more opportunities for burglaries.  To quote the second article for a brief rundown on the logic of Routine Activities applied to this topic:  >RA theory provides a more parsimonious explanation for seasonal differences than do psychological theories, which have led researchers to treat heat and cold as equivalent because both are aversive (Berkowitz, 1993). RA theory suggests that, in addition to examining how warm temperatures facilitate social interaction, we should also consider the possibility that cold reduces crime by inhibiting action, including interaction with other people (Cohen et al., 1980, p. 110). As a consequence, perpetrators are less likely to burglarize homes or commit robberies during cold than warm periods in fall and winter.  To be complete, there are studies about the psychological impact of hotter weather and whether it increases negative arousal. Anderson has published several papers exploring how higher temperatures can cause negative affect which may at least partially explain higher risk of aggression. There are laboratory findings to support the idea that there is a direct psychological effect to certain temperatures beyond the indirect effect of increased socialization and criminal opportunities, although it is harder to disentangle."

This article by Brian Deer for the British Medical Journal goes into more detail, but essentially -- Wakefield was a physician who forged results in several studies for financial gain. He first \"found\" a link between the MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine and Crohn's disease and claimed that people shouldn't get the combined vaccine. Coincidentally, months earlier he had patented a new measles-only vaccine.  He then published a highly controversial and, unfortunately, influential paper in 1998 that claimed the MMR vaccine was linked to autism. This is where your Jenny McCarthy's et al get this information. It has since been found that not only did Wakefield forge data in the study to make it seem like the MMR vaccine led to autism in children, but the entire time he was conducting the study at the behest of a lawyer who was attempting to sue vaccine manufacturers and was looking for a scientific standing to do so. Over two years, Wakefield made almost \u00a3500,000 to conduct this research.

Of course the Constitution was designed to be a fluid document and interpretations can change over the years (\"it's what the forefathers would have wanted\" is not an argument that generally holds much water for me), but historical context is also important to consider.  The impression I've been given about the Second Amendment is that its purpose was similar to that of the Third (no quartering of soldiers in civilian homes). Both functioning to keep the government from getting out of line, the Third being more preventative and the Second being more as a recourse for the population. This was in the days when a civilian militia and popular uprising could  have at least done significant damage to the United States Military and Government. In modern times this idea is of course laughable (taking the non-trivial assumption that the army would listen to orders to attack the populace). Arguments can of course be made about guerrilla warfare and significant popular support hiding them. I would respond to that by saying if it has gotten to that point, the Constitution would have been so torn up by those in power that what it says about gun ownership would be irrelevant.  There are modern justifications for the Second Amendment, but that is another discussion entirely. Also, as OP stated, the real discussion should be about inhibiting people from killing other people, but I think it is important to realize that the original justification for this Amendment is not really applicable any more. The reason I say this is to shift the burden of justification to those that are proponents of private gun ownership. The reason we used to do this is no longer applicable, what is the new reasoning?  Of course those arguments already have been, and will continue to be well hashed out by others, but more context is never a bad thing."

Of course, we spend roughly twice as much as equivalent countries, so that is a problem in its own right. But, the real issue is that health care spending has been rising, and is projected to continue to rise, much faster than the rate of inflation \u2013 usually in the range of 7-8% per year.   The Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\") is designed to address that in several ways. First, by expanding insurance coverage, people will be more likely to get regular checkups, use birth control, and other preventative measures that should see cost savings in the long run. There is some debate as to whether preventative care is that much cheaper, but overall it should help rather than hurt.  Second, the ACA established the Independent Payment Advisory Board, whose mission is to analyze Medicare spending and find ways to reduce costs without sacrificing quality of care. A tall order, to be sure, but the goal is to eliminate redundancies and encourage the most efficient care. One way it will probably do this is by encouraging \"bundled\" spending, where physicians receive payment based on the overall care a patient is receiving rather than on a per-service basis.   The ACA will also cut about $200 billion in Medicare spending over 10 years, mostly from Medicare Advantage, a privately-run Medicare alternative.  Finally, keep in mind that \"reduce the deficit\" is not always the same as \"save money.\" There are tax increases in the ACA as well.

Work by Timur Kuran shows that revolutions are hard to predict because even the people who eventually protest don\u2019t know their \u201crevolutionary potential\u201d.   However, I think it\u2019s safe to say that the states in Europe and North America are not weak in the same way that states experience revolution tend to be. And, I think it\u2019s also important to note, here haven\u2019t been that mean revolutions are attempted revolutions in mature industrial democracies. Again, we can talk about definitions and edge cases, and there have been a handful of military coups, but it\u2019s hard to think of popular protests removing a democratically elected government and installing a revolutionary one in a consolidated liberal democracy. But the reasons for this are fairly obvious: if there is a constituency large enough for a revolution, they can hope to simple vote their side into power in the elections.   This does happen in immature democracies *especially* after contested elections where widespread fraud is suspected (see again the point about the perception of government strength) or some other similar catalyzing event (the assassination that inspired the Cedar Revolution), but in these case it\u2019s pretty clear that even a majority may not be able to simply vote themselves into power and other actions are needed.   But in short, it would seem that the industrialized West is not close to the conditions where we might conventionally expect the *possibility* of a revolution and we\u2019d have to broaden our definition of \u201crevolution\u201d considerably to include things done through normal legislative means (such as the New Deal in 1930s America). Inequality alone is generally not seen a precursor to revolution.   You may be interesting at sociologist Randall Collins\u2019s piece \u201cTipping Point Revolutions and State Breakdown Revolutions\u201d. It was written directly after the Arab Spring and shows how those revolutions ended up being less revolutionary than they seemed in most cases.   He identifies three things that tend to happen before the big social revolutions we tend to think of when we think revolution (rather than the more political revolutions like the Cedar Revolution or the Arab Spring revolutions):   1) crippling fiscal crisis in the state.    2) elite paralysis.   3) mass mobilization.   While there have been political revolutions which changed how politics have been conducted, there hasn\u2019t really been a social revolution since fall of the Soviet Union. There have been changes of power and democratization, but not anything massive like the kind that could over throw a mature industrial democracy.  There is no indication that there will be any sort of revolution or anything like that in the post-industrialized West, though dictatorships and weak and illiberal democracies may continue experience events like the Arab Spring and the Color Revolutions."

                "content": " Because this is a widely debated topic both within and without academia, I believe that the question should be replied with more than just citing an article *even* if it is a meta-analysis (there have been many with different conclusions depending on the criteria used and interpretations).  For an example of the ongoing debate, see the APA. According to their resolution published in 2015](https://www.apa.org/about/policy/violent-video-games ), there is an association between aggression and video game exposure, but also noted the issue with terminology and interpretation:  >The **violent video game literature uses a variety of terms and definitions in considering aggression and aggressive outcomes**, sometimes using \"violence\" and \"aggression\" interchangeably, or using \"aggression\" to represent the full range of aggressive outcomes studied, including multiple types and severity levels of associated behavior, cognitions, emotions, and neural processes. This **breadth of coverage but lack of precision in terminology has contributed to some debate about the effects** of violent video game use. In part, the numerous ways that violence and aggression have been considered stem from the multidisciplinary nature of the field [...]  >Thus, **all violence, including lethal violence, is aggression, but not all aggression is violence**. This distinction is **important for understanding this research literature**, which has not focused on lethal violence as an outcome. Insufficient research has examined whether violent video game use causes lethal violence. The **distinction is also important for considering the implications of the research and for interpreting popular press accounts** of the research and its **applicability to societal events.**  On 2017, the [Media Psychology and Technology division of the APA had such things as the following to state:  >Journalists and policy makers do their constituencies a disservice in cases where they link acts of real-world violence with the perpetrators\u2019 exposure to violent video games or other violent media. There\u2019s **little scientific evidence to support the connection, and it may distract us from addressing those issues that we know contribute to real-world violence.**  >A wide body of research has examined the **impact of violent video games on relatively minor acts of aggression,** such as the administration of unwanted hot sauce to make food too spicy, making someone put his or her hand in freezing ice water or bursts of white noise in laboratory experiments. These studies have **resulted in mixed outcomes**, some reporting evidence for significant effects, and others do not ...]  > We note that **even among the members of APA Division 46 Society for Media Psychology and Technology, opinions regarding the impact of media violence on aggression differ considerably**.  It would be entirely reasonable for a scholar to argue that some links between violent media and aggression may exist, just as it is also reasonable for a scholar to argue that links between violent media and aggression do not exist.  For an example of how the issue is not straightforward, contrast the [2014 meta-analysis](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167213520459 ) with [Ferguson's 2015 meta-analysis which found that:   >Overall, **results from 101 studies suggest that video game influences** on increased aggression (r = .06), reduced prosocial behavior (r = .04), reduced academic performance (r = \u2212.01), depressive symptoms (r = .04), and attention deficit symptoms (r = .03) **are minimal**.   Furuya-Kanamori and Doi re-analyzed Ferguson's data and confirmed his meta-analysis.  Greitemeyer and M\u00fcgge's meta-analysis is also worth reading with the same nuance the authors demonstrate in their conclusions:  >Of course, **one can dispute whether an effect of r =.19 between violent video game exposure and aggressive behavior is of societal concern**. On one hand, **aggressive behavior is multidetermined**, with violent video game exposure being one source among many others (and some of them having a stronger influence than do violent video games). On the other hand, even small effects (and the effect of violent video games is small to medium in its effect size) can have a negative impact on societal level when many people are exposed to it (which certainly applies to violent video games). Thus, **in our view, violent video game play should be regarded as a risk factor** for aggressive behavior.  It is also interesting to highlight the fact they recognize, for example:  >...] **cooperatively playing a violent video game in a team** (relative to playing the same video game alone) **counteracts the negative effects of violent video game play on cooperative behavior** (Greitemeyer, Traut-Mattausch, & Osswald, 2012) and empathy (Greitemeyer, 2013).  The above is an example of how complex it is to talk about video games and what it affects, and how they may counter-act themselves, and whether effects are not only significant but also meaningful.  To cite a more recent meta-analysis by authors challenging Ferguson, [Prescott, Sargent and Hull analyzed prospective studies measuring overt physical aggression (although I would note that it is not obvious which behaviors exactly are included in such a category). They found \"**a modest effect size of \u22480.11 when additional covariates were not included**\". As they comment, Ferguson would consider such effects quite small if not meaningless, nevertheless they also argue for a different point of view: *the question remains*.  For example, \"**Cohen (1969, p23) describes an effect size of 0.2 as 'small'** and gives to illustrate it the example that the difference between the heights of 15 year old and 16 year old girls in the US corresponds to an effect of this size.\" but \"**Cohen does acknowledge the danger of using terms like 'small', 'medium' and 'large' out of context.**\"  Now, if one takes into consideration how violence has been declining in Western countries, those same countries in which the video game industry has been growing increasingly fast, and how video games are becoming more and more mainstream, one has to carefully ponder about the impact of video games on real life violent behavior at least as a whole.  Last comment regarding Prescott and colleagues' meta-analysis, they found differences for ethnicity, suggesting an effect of culture. One should question why violent video games might have the (relatively) largest effects on White participants, intermediate for Asians and none for Hispanics. This requires to further nuance any impact violent video games might have even if one finds an (arguably weak) effect. At least, it is not a direct effect and it depends on other factors."

                "content": " There are probably a few contributing factors: how recent the event is, the death toll, degree of damage, media coverage of the event, notability of the target.  The Oklahoma City Bombing killed 168 people and injured 680 others. It caused an estimated $652 million dollars in damage. It occurred 6 years prior to 9/11, and targeted the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building, which, while it may have been a landmark for citizens of Oklahoma City, was largely unknown to citizens outside of that area. The remains of the building were demolished a month after the attacks.  9/11 killed 2,996, caused over 6,000 injuries, and an estimated $10 billion in damage. They targeted the twin towers of the World Trade Center, a major landmark that every tourist to New York City and even people who've never been there recognize -- look at any given movie set in NYC prior to 2001. There's almost certainly a shot of the two towers at some point in the film. They also targeted the Pentagon, 229 miles away, which influences the localized effect of the attacks.  The 7/7 London bombings killed 52 people and injured about 700. The attacks took place on the London Underground and on a bus in Tavistock Square in 2005.  Pearl Harbor was a military attack in 1941, so it has some inherent qualities that separate it from the other attacks mentioned here, but it's an event with a lot of historical significance, and it's much older than the others, so I think it's worth mentioning. 2,403 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded.  So, we can examine some differences between these attacks that might contribute to the historical memorability or significance of the attacks.  First, death toll. Of our four examples, Pearl Harbor is the only attack that comes close to 9/11's casualty count. The composition of the population of victims may be a contributing factor as well. 316 foreign nationals from 84 countries were killed in 9/11; they account for almost 10% of those killed. By contrast, the other attacks mentioned predominantly killed citizens of the country in which the attack happened. This may influence the international impact of the attack. Interestingly, more British citizens were killed in the 9/11 attacks than during the 7/7 bombings, despite not occurring on British soil.  Second, media coverage. This study found that exposure to the 9/11 attacks was a significant factor in the amount of emotional distress people reported afterwards, more than degree of loss experienced. Consider the types of media coverage we saw during 9/11 - eyewitness video of the planes actually striking the buildings in a fiery explosion, eyewitness video of people leaping to their deaths from the windows, video of people running from the rolling wall cloud of smoke and debris as the towers fall. By contrast, we have little video of the OKC bombing that occurs during the attacks. There may be some unreleased security camera footage that show the bombing as it happens, but most of our footage shows only the aftermath -- the shredded hulk of the Murrah building.  Third, economic impact. This study examined the macroeconomic impact of 9/11 (and even compares it to other terrorist attacks, including OKC). The 9/11 attacks strongly correlate with a *national* decrease in US GDP growth and an increase in unemployment, at least in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. With other terrorist attacks, we tend to see more localized effects -- OKC bombing, for example, might have affected the economy of Oklahoma City or even of the state of Oklahoma itself, but had little effect on the national economy.  Fourth, recency. The 7/7 bombings occurred in 2005, making them the most recent, but this seems to be less of a factor than the factors mentioned above -- they may be memorable to citizens of the UK and most especially to Londoners, but I doubt it had much global impact. To my knowledge, no studies have been done on the global recognition of the 7/7 bombings.  However, me might look at recency in events with similar casualty counts and media coverage, such as between 9/11 and Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor occurred in 1941. The youngest people alive who experienced it as it happened (even as infants) are 73 years old this year. By contrast, the youngest people alive who were alive (even as infants) during 9/11 are 13 years old. 6% of people alive today in the US remember Pearl Harbor as it happened;  by contrast, 80% of the people alive today in the US remember 9/11 as it happened. US Census data. This may be a contributing factor in the attention given to 9/11 over other attacks.  Fifth, total destruction. OKC and the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center totally destroyed their targets. The 7/7 bombings damaged some trains and may have caused some infrastructure damage to the tunnels, but ultimately did not destroy the London Underground, and from my research, it appears that the routes affected by the bombings are still in use today. Notably, the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon tends to be de-emphasized in memorial media; it did not destroy the Pentagon, the Pentagon was not converted into a memorial site like the OKC site and 9/11 Ground Zero and death tolls at the Pentagon were lower than other targets affected by the attack."

What confuses me even more is that the US seems to struggle with Israeli policy, even though it has massive leverage over the country. Israeli militants do things like invade Lebanon or push Palestinians off their land and the US doesn't do much about it (I'm assuming here that if the US really wanted to do something about it, it would have). Wouldn't it make more sense to try gaining the trust of Muslim countries, since the US is doing so much in the Middle East right now?   Some people say that the Jewish lobby in the US is really strong. From what I understand though, it's more of a Jewish lobby and less of an Israeli one, isn't it?

The biggest group of Israel supporters in the US are not religious Jews, but conservative Christians who support Israel unconditionally as the nation of God's chosen people. Many of them believe that Jesus will come back after the Jews rebuild Solomon's Temple, which will be on the site of the Dome of the Rock. This requires, among other things, for Israel to exist.   Christian Zionism is not in the news, because it isn't controversial. Among Christian Conservatives, there simply isn't any debate about whether Israel is in the right. Personally I think that doctrine is anti-Christian and would disgust Jesus, who preached absolute pacificism. However, American Christianity includes many who preach that God loves wealth, hates love, and demands Theocracy.  Check out this quote (from here):  >Genesis 12 says, \u201cI will bless those who bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee,\u201d Hagee preaches that **\u201cas people, churches, and nations deal with the State of Israel, so God will deal with them.\u201d** He tells the crowd, with equal parts grin and gruff, \u201cGet ready! Good things are getting ready to happen to you.\u201d  >\u201cThere are voices in the U.S. State Department calling for the city of Jerusalem to be divided,\u201d Hagee says. The crowd shouts a drawn out \u201cNo!\u201d unprompted. \u201cLet\u2019s make this clear!\u201d Hagee continues. \u201cThere shall be one Jerusalem. Never divided. For any reason. Not now and not ever!\u201d  How extreme are Christian Zionists? My dad is one, and he thinks the US must and should be *destroyed utterly* in the defense of Israel. Why? Because the US isn't mentioned in the prophecies of the end of the world, but as a Christian nation he thinks it must have some part in the prologue of the events."

These are the programs that would most likely be replaced by UBI.   Estimated total cost of these two (34% of total spending) is about $1.1 trillion. At $10k per year per adult(230M) and $5k per year per child (86M)source, UBI would cost $2.73 trillion, or about $1.6 trillion more than we spend now on such programs.   Some money might come from states, which each have their own safety net programs that would become redundant. States overall spend about $250 billion source. This would reduce the amount needed to $1.35 trillion. If all of that came from new federal taxes, that would be about a 33% increase overall.  There is no consensus on where that extra money would come from, but no one that I've seen has proposed cutting education. Most people advocating UBI also advocate universal healthcare, so any monies going to Medicare/Medicade/CHIP now would be redirected to some US version of the UK's NHS. Most proposals call for tax reform (especially cutting corporate tax loopholes) but there would need to be significant increases in revenue, which would have other economic consequences.   EDIT: a thought: without raising taxes or cutting revenue and only redirecting funds from existing programs, adults would receive about $5000 and children $2500 per year. Not enough to live on."

The way the work is presented in the books is often exagerated or made to seem much more sound and conclusive than the claims made in the original papers.

Originally, rational choice theory was confined to mainly the allocation of scarce resources (the traditional domain of economics) but increasingly it's being used to explain much more.  Gary Becker really started that revolution in mainstream economics, looking at so much more than market behavior and consumption patterns.   The above article was written at a time when it looked like rational choice was going to take over sociology, when James Coleman was bringing rat choice models into sociology, when he was regularly collaborating with Becker himself, and they were found new journals, like Social Science Research.  It didn't catch on in sociology, but what sociologists wouldn't for the most part do (in part because our training in rational choice is *horrible*--other than people who went to UChicago in the 1980's and 1990's, it seems like most sociologists only treat rational choice as a laughable boogey man), economists did themselves in what's called \"Economic Imperialism\".  That's not an insult, that's the name of an economics article praising this development.  Here's the abstract, which I think gives a sense of why many economists think so highly of themselves and so poorly of other social scientists.  I mean, just peep the first line:  >Economics is not only a social science, it is a genuine science. Like the physical sciences, economics uses a methodology that produces refutable implications and tests these implications using solid statistical techniques. In particular, economics stresses three factors that distinguish it from other social sciences. Economists use the construct of rational individuals who engage in maximizing behavior. Economic models adhere strictly to the importance of equilibrium as part of any theory. Finally, a focus on efficiency leads economists to ask questions that other social sciences ignore. These ingredients have allowed economics to invade intellectual territory that was previously deemed to be outside the discipline's realm.  I'd say that's a different way of saying the \"clean models\" thing.  Economists are well aware of this drift into areas once covered by other fields. The well-known microeconomist Bryan Caplan has a very insightful blog post called \"In a Perfect World, I'd Call Myself a Sociologist\".  There's an old joke that goes something like, \"The difference between economists and everyone else is that economist assume people are fundamental the same.\"  This lets them try to answer a lot of questions that other social sciences feel like they can't.  And it also means that they often don't need to read other fields' \"theories\" because in rational choice they already have a convincing theory, to say nothing about methods.  While economists might accept some lab experiments from psychology, they tend to prefer causal methods and discount even quantitive methods from other social sciences that aren't experimental or quasi-experimental (IVs, regression discontinuity, etc), for applied micro, at least.  While some have argued that economic theory is actually largely qualitative and only hidden under a thin veneer of equations--this is the argument of economics' most famous Cassandra, Deirdre McCloskey, in her excellent *Secret Sins of Economists* (full PDF here)--there of course hasn't been any openly qualitative economics in generations, which means that many discount economics work out of hand (McCloskey's pamphlet of a book is a great read; for critics of economics, it lays out some clear virtues, and for proponents of economics, it makes some strong arguments for certain vices).  While there has been challenges from within economics to several parts of rational choice theory's core assumptions--that all people all the same and culture has some clear importance in behavior has recently been challenged (probably most famously in the really dope article \"In Search of Homoeconomicus\"), as has the whole idea that people are rational utility maximizers (basically by the whole field of behavioral economics)--this of course hasn't caused an abandonment or even retreat from economics's core ideas or the increased adoption of theory from other social sciences (except some social psychology).  But while others will point to methods (which are undeniably more statistically sophisticated) or training (which is undeniably more rigorous for the modal student), I really think it's economics' clear, universalist theory that really sets it apart."

Under the WTO, countries are still allowed to have relatively high tariffs. Basically, when countries become members of the WTO they set their bound tariff rates, which is the highest rate they are allowed to raise their tariff. They also set an applied tariff, which is the actual tariff rate and usually substantially lower than the bound tariff. Having a bound / applied tariff gives a country room to adjust their tariff policies in the event of some domestic issues, shock to commodity prices, etc. Anyway, the WTO is primarily about getting countries to stop using non-tariff barriers to trade (so things like local content requirements or not applying international patent laws). By ridding countries of 'unfair' or 'distortionary' non-tariff barriers to trade, the WTO tries to confine the international trade regime to one focused on tariffs.  Bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements and investment treaties go much further than the WTO. They include detailed provisions on non-tariff barriers which are MORE stringent than those of the WTO in addition to requiring lower tariffs. Even though these agreements reduce a country's policy space to choose their optimal trade policy (and trade policy is a very important tool for development - virtually all developed countries used these now forbidden non-tariff barriers to build their own manufacturing base), they provide better than market access to the other country than can be achieved through the WTO. This makes bilateral/multilateral trade agreements attractive even though it may hurt a country's ability to protect and nurture its own industries.  See: Kenneth C. Shadlen (2005).

                "content": " In abstract terms, economic growth is not unsustainable (population growth probably is)\u2014of course, this will depend on what we define as economic growth.   A more direct question would necessarily revolve around the nature of capitalism. Can the logic of capital accumulation provide the basis for a sustainable world? As we have seen throughout modern history, capital seeks out new markets, transforming previously unmarketable goods into commodities. This includes many things, from health services, to ideas, to water, to complex financial instruments. In other words, there is an expansion of 'places' (markets) in which commodities can be bought and sold, places where 'things' are transformed into commodities that can be privately and exclusively owned, either by individuals or fictitious individuals, such as the corporation. In this process, capital (as a set of social relations) seeks to 'privatize' or commoditize everything and anything so as to produce more capital. There are setbacks to be sure\u2014the welfare state is a good example\u2014based on political and economic conditions, the balance of class power, and other factors, but on the whole the trajectory is toward more and more capital accumulation, and thus, greater centralization of capital in what we now call transnational corporations.  Given the general nature of this logic, the trajectory is toward a fairly dystopian world where everything (and I mean everything) is bought and sold, subject to market forces. This is, of course, a hypothetical situation in which contingency plays no part\u2014and as we know, historical events are nothing if not incredibly contingent, and in some cases, contradictory to our understanding of development.   By itself, the nature and logic of capital accumulation seems unsustainable in the long run without destroying the planet and pushing the majority of the world's subordinate classes into further poverty, with less control of their political economic futures. Of course, that in itself is unsustainable, and thus, as we move from crisis to crisis we see different popular reactions and counter-movements (e.g., the Quebec student strike, Occupy, etc.). So while capital accumulation is likely unsustainable, I do not think it is impossible to have a world in which 'economic growth' is sustainable, but this would need to be an economic growth based not merely on profit for individuals\u2014fictitious or otherwise\u2014but rather, those who create social wealth in the first place.  That is my personal view on the matter, but in answer to your question of why governments are obsessed with 'growth' you could take a number of different approaches. Using a Foucauldian lens, you might ask where our fascination for 'growth' came from, examining texts and archives, etc., to determine the genealogy of the concept (more so, in the sense of what Foucault might call a particular governmentality of growth).  You could also take a Marxian-influenced perspective that examines the role of the state. The state (and government) cannot be viewed as independent actors. They are explicitly tied to the economic system, and, as such, are themselves a relation of production that makes possible the appearance of a separation between the political and economic system. Therefore, you might want to examine the particular 'economic'\u2014not to be taken as a separate entity\u2014conditions that has framed the nature of 'growth' in particular eras. Are they different? Why or why not? Is it merely a case of what I outline above, based on the nature of capital accumulation? Or, are there other factors that have influenced the nature of growth, its trajectory and development? What about political ideologies such as neoliberalism which takes a somewhat different approach to growth than the policies of the Keynesian Welfare State?  That's just a start, but hopefully it helps."

He's been looking kinda mopey at times. I just had this feeling to get him looked at and get x-rays.  He has a cough that was noted before by my regular vet, but that could also be common in bulldogs.  Otherwise, he seems very healthy and happy. He goes for regular walks, plays and runs, & eats as much as he can always.  This afternoon I took him to the new vet for x-rays (cost related), and I was not left feeling confident at all with him. He came in, and the first thing he said is my dog is very sick. He showed me the x-rays and said he has fluid around his heart, & from what he pointed out I can't disagree. He said his heart is very large, but didn't give me a baseline of what would be normal; he also asked if my dog was a Frenchie when we walked in, so idk what standard he's comparing to when you can't even tell the difference between an adult Frenchie and English bulldog. The vet also said he has a lot of air in his abdomen. My boy has always had a lot of gas, another common trait of bulldogs, so not sure again how the x-ray compares to normal for his breed. lastly, he said my dog has bronchitis, consistent with the cough we've been keeping an eye on (no change to it in 2 months).  Treatment suggested was; medication for the bronchitis, and surgery to determine the cause of & reduce the fluid around the heart. I'm nervous if surgery as the risk is much higher for Bulldogs. Or, he said to just enjoy the time with him as he's already very old (10 yrs is THAT old? He still plays & acts like a puppy)  I immediately scheduled an appointment with my regular vet and for the x-rays to be sent to her, but she can't see us until next Wednesday. I'm hoping someone can look at them & lmk if I should be as concerned as the vet made it seem, and thus seek another opinion much sooner than Wednesday.  A second opinion on how the x-rays look would be really appreciated!!  x-ray pics here  Thank you in advance! I'm literally so uneasy and worried about my baby after that appointment.\n\nAssistant:"

(in one view, you can see the circular shape just below his lungs that is black and patchy.) when a dog is having difficulty breathing, they'll pant harder and end up swallowing air.  his stomach is black on the x-ray because of all this air he swallowed while panting.    now take a look at the normal heart x-ray.  it's pretty distinctly heart shaped and in the center of the chest.  your dog's heart on the other hand, is very round, and takes up almost his entire chest.  there are a lot of different causes for heart disease, none of which i'll get into here, but visually, there is something very wrong with his heart.    based on his x-rays alone, his condition is very worrying, and i would get a second opinion (see if you can get a referral to a specialist) before Wednesday."

Thanks in advance  &#x200B;  * **Species: Common european** * **Age: ???** * **Sex/Neuter status: Male**  Sadly, that's all I know\n\nAssistant:"

I recently adopted a stray female dog, and was advised by my vet that we should delay spaying her until after her first or second heat.  She indicated that some recent studies had shown there to be some health benefits found in delaying spaying and neutering, although I didn't press further.  She just completed her first heat, what has been a rather frustrating experience (wrestling a hyperactive puppy into diapers multiple times a day, being able to fully socialize her in the dog park with potentially unaltered males, etc.).  Can anyone link me to the studies showing this, especially if they happen to be in an open access journal?  I'd like to better understand the benefits and drawbacks, and I figure going back to the original published research might help.  I figure then I'll be able to look at the methodology (RCT? Cohort study?) , sample size, figure out absolute vs relative risk, number needed to treat, etc.  Also, am I mistaken that previous thought was that early spaying and neutering had health benefits?  How are those supposed benefits of early spaying/neutering balanced against the supposed benefits of later spaying/neutering?  Thanks!\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " Great question!  In large and giant breed dogs (adult weight of 40kg+) it is sometimes advised to delay sterilisation until after skeletal maturity.  This is because of the way that some of the sex hormones interacts with growth hormone and it may result in them growing too tall, which may predispose them to joint issues.  In small and medium breed dogs the effect isn't as significant.  Let's start by defining a \"spay\" as an ovariohysterectomy, or a surgery where the uterus and ovaries are removed completely.  Pre-pubertal spaying is most commonly advised due to the fact that it decreases the risk of beast cancer. \"Mammary tumors are more common in female dogs that are either not spayed or were spayed after 2 years of age. The risk of a dog developing a mammary tumor is 0.5% if spayed before their first heat (approximately 6 months of age), 8% after their first heat, and 26% after their second heat. Cats spayed before 6 months of age have a 7-times reduced risk of developing mammary cancer and spaying at any age reduces the risk of mammary tumors by 40% to 60% in cats.\" (https://www.acvs.org/small-animal-es/mammary tumors)  However everything has advantages and disadvantages.  Early spaying will greatly reduce the risk of mammary cancer.  Spaying at any point in the pet's lifetime will prevent uterine, ovarian and vaginal cancer, and will prevent pyometra.  Studies have found that spaying will mildly increase things like hip dysplasia, cranial cruciate disease, some cancers including lymphoma and mast cell tumour.  It moderately increases the longevity of the pet and it is linked to urinary sphincter incompetence. (https://files.brief.vet/migration/article/30161/amo_age-of-neutering-in-large--giant-breed-dogs-30161-article.pdf)  In my opinion, if you do not plan to breed with a pet it should be sterilised. Like you said it's messy to deal the nappies when they are in heat and trying to keep a pup away from intact male dogs.  The other big advantage is decreased risk of mammary cancer and increased life expectancy.  The disadvantages like obesity and urinary incontinence are easily prevented and treated respectively.  These disadvantages do not validate the increased risk of mammary cancer and the trouble heat behaviour causes and elicits in other dogs in my opinion.  Younger dogs tolerate anaesthesia much better and are less likely to have complications than middle aged or older dogs.  Once a dog develops pyometra she also becomes very unstable and anaesthesia may be life threatening in severe cases.  The reason I focus so much on the mammary cancer vs the increased risk of other cancers like lymphoma and mast cell is because mammary cancer has been proven to have a hormonal influence and has been proven to be less prevalent in spayed dogs.  Lymphoma and mast cell tumour are not hormonally influenced cancers, and the increased risk may be due to the fact that spayed dogs live longer, and not as a direct result of a spay.  In the end you are the person responsible for your pets' health and you have to make the decision that you see fit.  At the same time it is also your responsibility to make sure that the decisions that you make are well informed, and find out more information.  Thanks for asking!"

She is soon 6 years old. I found her randomly on Facebook and fell in love with her. When I picked her up, her previous owner told me that she does not know much about the cat, as she got it from someone else too and I suppose she didn't care much. Even though her previous owner did not give a flying BEEP about her and allegedly did not know if the cat is vaccinated or any of her medical history, I wanted to save her and give her a permanent home. 4 months went by and I managed to save enough money to get her to the vet and spay her. I took her to the vet and the doctor told me she will give me a call when she is done with the surgery. I leave the vet clinic and as soon as I get home I receive a call from the vet saying that they will not be able to perform the surgery because they found two cysts on the cats abdominal area. The doctor said there is a 90% chance that those would be malignant tumors and the cat has mammary cancer. Of course, I started crying as I grew very attached to the cat in the time I spent with her. The doctor then urged me to make a quick decision as the cat was still under anaesthesia, either sample the tumor to make sure it's malign, go through surgery or put her down. This was a very hard decision for me.   First of all, sampling the tumor or performing the surgery right away would have been extremely expensive and I did not have the money at the time, and second of all, I cannot just put down my cat while I am having a breakdown. I felt like my world fell apart in that moment. Quickly made an appointment at another clinic for a second opinion. I asked the doctor if I have time to start a GoFundMe to get the money as quick as possible and have surgery done and they told me that there is no time and no reason to do that because the cat was still under anaesthesia and I should decide in that moment. If I could go back in time I would tell them how unprofessional it is to make a cat parent go through such a thing. In the end, when they saw that I could not decide as they left me no choice but to put her down in that moment to not 'waste the anaesthesia', they said that there is no point to perform a surgery or sample anyway because there is a high chance that the cat will die under surgery anyway. After hearing this, I cancelled the other appointment check up I had made at the other clinic, as I saw no point in it anymore.   I want to mention that I have nothing against putting down pets, it was just the shock that made me freeze. Incapable of making a choice, I opted to wait for the cat to wake up and to take her home. I rushed back to the clinic and I met the doctor who then advised me to keep an eye out for any signs of illness, as the cat was feeling fine at the time. Doctor gave the cat one month to live... You can judge all you want but I felt it was shocking and cruel to put down a perfectly healthy and happy cat at that time.  As the weeks went by I went through a period of grieving, preparing to say my goodbyes to my sweet little kitty. Spoiled her tons, gave her the space she needed, her favourite snacks...and I waited.  I live in northern Europe where it's extremely expensive to perform surgery, before anyone tries to jump at my neck for not going through with that. Would have costed me about 3300 US Dollars for the surgery, plus an extra 1000 to see if its a malignant tumor, something that my student job would not be able to cover. The check up they did which only included shaving the hair and the anaesthesia costed me 200 US Dollars. I knew this was going to be a very expensive journey and was ready to take out a loan if I could, start a funding campaign, anything. Gave up on the thought because of the vet's advice.  It's been 6 months since then and she is still here. Still normal bowel habits, appetite of an alligator, sociable attitude, pukes once every two weeks and it's always hairballs. And I am wondering, where did me or the vet go wrong here? Is it possible the cat is indeed sick but not showing it? Was it an attempted money grab by the clinic? Could the chest lumps be something else? (I cannot feel or see them anymore as the cat's hair has completely grown back)  TLDR: 6 year old female domestic shorthair cat got diagnosed with mammal cancer, vet did not give her long to live but she is still alive and thriving after 6 months.\n\nAssistant:"

Weight: 4lbs (not a typo) Neutered: yes  He has a fairly long history as we've been back and forth to the vet a ton of times since January... Here goes what I can remember. First vet visit was because he was only having small amounts of stools, always diarrhea, with blood and clear mucus. Vet said probably worms, gave a bunch of meds: albon, metronidazole & one other I cannot remember but was a dewormer or antibiotic... It's something common and it's on the tip of my tongue.   Anyway didn't work. Bring him back, she says ok maybe it's giardia and treats with panacur. That didn't work either. After that they kept him all day, did bloodwork & an xray, kept him all day for a barium swallow to make sure he is passing everything fine. He was cleared and sent home. They could not retrieve a stool sample all day so I was sent home and tasked with this. Was told by a different vet when I picked him up that some of his bloodwork was abnormal and consistent with FIP and that if it wasn't tritrichomonas, which they suspected but wanted to confirm with PCR because of the side effects of ronidazole.   Finally get a stool sample a few days later and they send it off for a PCR test. Was positive for tritrichomonas. Treated with ronidazole, standard dose for 14 days. Seemed better but got worse again, so they retreated him thinking maybe since he's so small and weak it wasn't cleared out of him completely. I finished that 14 day regimen Saturday. In the meantime I've forgotten that they ever mentioned FIP to me and he's seeming more bright and alert so I take that as a positive sign.  I spend the next day bleaching the litter boxes and I also gave him a bath cause he had made a mess of himself with feces and was sickly and not really cleaning well. I will note but I'm not sure if it matters that he was weird about his food this whole time. LOVES wet food, would cry and cry for it and I fed him as often as he wanted cause he was so small and I just wanted to get weight on him but he would get picky and food he previously loved, he wouldn't eat. Never knew what was up with that but it was pretty discouraging. Needless to say he never gained any weight back, he started out at 6.5lbs when I initially brought him to the vet and just to clarify he was still probably 6mo. Old kitten size & the vet told me his growth was probably stunted.  After the bath I gave him on Sunday he started acting a little weird, like wobbly and wasn't walking well and I was concerned maybe I got water in his ears and I read online that it's generally harmless and will clear up so I didn't think much of it. I blow dried him a bit with my hair dryer on low and then let him rest on a heated blanket.   I woke up on Thursday morning and he wasn't moving. He was breathing but not moving, I picked him up his eyes seemed OK and responsive, I asked him if he was hungry because usually he excitedly responds but he didn't. I tried to feed him but he wouldn't eat. He tried to get up and wobbled and fell over. I immediately brought him to the vet (a different one closer to my house cause this was an emergency) and they took him back to try and get blood and evaluate him. They got his history from my other vet. The vet came and told me his gums were pale and that they couldn't even draw blood cause he was so frail and she basically said his heart isn't pumping enough blood and that it's not looking good. That I could transfer him to a specialty hospital for a blood transfusion and hospitalization but the outcome would still be uncertain. By the time she brought him back to me he was already starting to pass, so we opted to have him euthanized. She said his symptoms were consistent with FIP from what she can tell and that's when I remembered the other vet mentioned that at the very beginning.   What is really eating at me though and it's probably irrational is the bath I gave him. Did I make him worse by giving him a bath?? Did his body get too cold and the blood flow got worse and never recovered? He seemed to go downhill straight after that, though there were no clear signs, looking back that's all I can think. Please help me with some closure because all I can do is picture him dying on the table and thinking that I killed him by giving him a bath \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d   If you read this far thank you so much for caring about my sweet baby boy. He was so, so special to me and even though I had him for a short time I hope that he didn't spend these last few months suffering or in pain. He didn't seem like he was but I know cats can hide it well. I'm just a mess over this.\n\nAssistant:"

The town I live in is tiny and the vet here is ill equipped; the next city over is a 2 hours car drive where they would have the equipment (i.e. an ultrasound) to try and find the cause of the problem.  Puppy is 5 months old, vaccinated, normally 13.5kg (30lbs) and we rescued him when he was approx 6 weeks old abandoned in a drainage (he's classed as a Southeast Asian village dog by EmbarkVet).  Summary of symptoms:  * Vomits multiple times * Lethargy * Refuses to eat * Weight loss * Very runny stool (occurred only once) * No fever  **Day 1**  I woke my pup up at 7am in his crate to see he's still somewhat asleep. This is weird as normally he'd wake me up and he would usually walk out of the crate within 5 seconds of me opening. We have our morning walk but I cut it short as I see he's not too energetic. I serve him breakfast kibbles and he refused his food. He refused lunch as well. He also refused his treats and would spit it out. I tried chicken breast and he ate it, so I served him a small amount of rice and chicken breast because it concerned me he wasn't taking anything. That was the only meal he had. He was very low energy the whole day and spent his time on the couch chilling. He also did not poop at all this day.  **Day 2**  I woke him up at 7am again to see he has vomited in his crate. He seemed energetic so we had a short walk and he finally pooped (solid stool) and on the way back, he vomited white/yellow foam bile. He vomited again two more times at home. We waited for the nearby vet to open at 9am to bring him. Vet prescribed metoclopramide (for the vomiting?), liver support pills and b-plex. They also gave us Royal Canin Convalesce Support (RCCS) to force feed him. Back home, he ends up vomiting out all the pills we gave and all the food we force fed. He also vomited every time he drank water. Puppy has no energy and we see visible weight loss  **Day 3**  I woke him up at 7am again and he's vomited 2 times in his play pen. We brought him back to the vet and told them about day 2. We asked for an IV drip (administered under the skin) as he was now skin and bones and dehydrated. He's also lost 1.5kg (3lbs). During this time, he had a runny stool outside the vet's office which the vet saw. No blood, just very runny. They prescribed metronidazole (antibiotics) which they helped him take. We also managed to get him to take the metoclopramide and both pills stayed down. We force fed him a small amount of the RCCS 2 hours after the vet visit and he puked it all out 5 minutes after. My SO & I decided to not feed him at all to allow his stomach to recover (after doing some googling) as we notice the vomiting happens after he drinks water or we feed him the RCCS. In the evening, we got him to take the pills but he puked out the antibiotics minutes after he drank a bit of water.  **Day 4**  This is where I'm at now, we just woke him up at 630am and it is now 8am my time. Luckily he hasn't vomited in his pen which is a positive sign but he still refuses food and has no energy. He's looking even thinner than he was yesterday. Our options are either, go to another vet nearby for a second opinion or drive up 2 hours to the city and get him checked there and ask for an ultrasound to see what's going on in his stomach. Or we stick to the prescribed plan and ride it out. We have not given him his pills yet this morning as we fear he may puke it out again. We feel quite defeated that everytime we force feed his pill or food, he is hating us for handling him in such a way and he ends up vomiting soon after.  Any advice?\n\nAssistant:"

People were confused, and couldn't or did not ask their vet, about a diagnosis or finding and they are seeking clarification of medical labs, pictures, etc. 4. Their pet is dying and they do not want to really accept it so they ask for a 'better' opinion that keeps their pet alive longer 5.

If your regular vet can\u2019t do it, ask them for a recommendation if they know someone who can (other than the emergency vet).   You might end up at the emergency hospital anyway, depending on the local availability of veterinary ophthalmologists, but it might be cheaper to start at the regular vet. Another option is to call any local vet ophthalmologists and see if they require a referral or if they\u2019d see you in this urgent situation. Most, however, do require a referral and want the animal to have been given a once-over by his primary vet\u2026  If you are unable to pay for or borrow money for treatment (check this sub\u2019s sidebar for ideas), please look into local rescues/shelters/as a last resort sometimes your vet will allow you to surrender the pet to them if you\u2019re unable to care for it.

If her bladder is damaged, then it can't fill properly and it means her urine is emptying out into the abdomen.  >If her bladder is ok are her chances of recovering good?   Should be ok.  First things first - her condition needs to be stabilised. There are various things that can be done while if her bladder has ruptured, including abdominocentesis to dilute and remove urine.  Her pelvis will likely also need to be repaired, and her leg amputated.  Your vet saying to wait and see is really all that can be done at this point in time - her condition needs to be properly evaluated and stabilised.   Just continue to stay in dialogue with them.

Call every vet in your area within a few mile radius and communicate that your dog has a closed pyometra and needs surgery and ask if they can give you a ballpark price range because you are financially limited.

I met him on his very first day where he was thrown away in a closed trash bad with his brothers and sisters, in a freaking rainy night in the middle of October. Only 2 survived. I fed him like a baby. From the moment he could walk, he was ALWAYS after me and it never stopped. I was the only one who could touch him, kiss him.. he was always right next to me. He literally sleep with me, under the covers lol. He was the sweetest soul ever, so kind with me. Yet he was a tiger with people he didnt like, especially vets lol.   I had to take the worse decision ever. But I wanted to stay by his side until the very end. They first gave him a shot to make him sleep. And during that, I stayed with him, talked to him, kissed him, touched him. His eyes were still open but the vet told me that he was sleeping, such shot make them keep their eyes open.  And I stayed with him when they did the last shot, the pink one.  I was still talking to him, petting him, kissing him and then I was told \"There. He's gone now.\" His eyes were still open which broke my heart even more. I stayed with him until I was told to leave.   By your own experiences, do you think he was aware that he was not alone???

They took him in another room to do the first \"sleeping shot\" and came right after it. Yet when I took him in my arms, I think he was already sleeping because of how hard he was fighting.

The report came back and it was determined that the mass was in fact likely a benign polyp. While it was not life-threatening, it was probably causing my dog to vomit blood (which is why I brought him in to begin with) so we would go ahead and remove it surgically.   The surgeon called afterwards and informed me that he was actually not able to find ANYTHING in my dog\u2019s stomach; not a mass, not a polyp, nothing!

Winnie, our lovely cat suffered a head trauma last year in November 2019 that may have been caused by a car accident (we're not entirely sure as we didn't actually witness it, although he looked very rough and we think he was clipped rather than run over). At the time he had surgery to remove a canine fang and a general tidy up of\u00a0 the injury.\u00a0  During his recovery he had some nasal/eye discharge that was running clear, yellow and green at different times, which would sometimes dry off and look like it was clearing up but overall persisted.\u00a0  We brought him back into the vet in March earlier this year as a strong smell had been coming out of him, smelling like dead flesh or something really funky. He had also been sneezing frequently trying to clear whatever was bothering him. He was issued antibiotics and we all noticed the discharge and sneezing was markedly improved and the smell was almost gone. Unfortunately this didn't last, and so he was reissued a longer script to help combat these symptoms. We finished this script and the condition sadly returned again, this would have been  about early May 2020.  We emailed the vets with an update on his condition in June because he almost seemed worse than he originally started in terms of smell, sneezing and discharge. We wondered if there was any other possible explanation for his symptoms, such as a tooth socket gone septic from his original surgery, or even a possible broken tooth that is undetected.\u00a0The vets issued him a longer script of antibiotics which was supposed to completely address any issues of infection. He was on a 6 week course of antibiotics - day and night - which didn't make much of a difference. We are now in September and the antibiotics have been finished and we are back at square one and unsure what to do.  He really is a cool cat and it's a tragedy he is so smelly and offensive, it has completely affected his quality of life as he is very friendly and loves people but so smelly he cannot be petted.

I have family, but they are not close. My wife and my two dogs are my family.      Gus was different.      When I was feeling my loneliest, isolated from COVID, Gus was there.      My other dog has a special relationship with my wife. If my wife shows any emotion, Bella (our other lab) is there, sitting on her chest. Comforting her. She loves me, but she *loves* my wife.      When I feel my most rejected. In my darkest place, Gus is there. We had such a strong bond. Honestly, I am closer to him than I have ever been to another living thing.      Tonight I am alone.   &#x200B;  The vets and the staff did everything they could. We bought Bella with us to say goodbye.      There was not a dry eye in the house.

                "content": " I am so sorry you are facing the decision of euthanizing your animal, and I am equally sorry you have had such terrible experiences with euthanasia in the past.  When a vet or euthanasia tech prepares to euthanize a pet, they first anesthetize the animal so they are not awake when given euthanasia drugs. When an animal is anesthetized, they enter a state where they cannot form new memories or interpret pain. If you've had surgery where they put you to sleep, you probably experienced this state; you may remember how it felt to \"wake up\" like you'd travelled forward in time, but you likely had no memory of your surgery.   You don't remember what happened after the doctor counted down, but you probably seemed (somewhat) conscious to onlookers even after you stopped making memories. That quality is just about the first thing to go in anesthesia, but the brain is still \"awake\" enough to respond to stimuli. At this point you, or your pet, have entered the first of four anesthetic stages.  The second stage of anesthesia is likely to blame for your animals' startling behaviors. This is the excitatory stage; many people/animals make loud vocalizations and may thrash as the brain loses control of inhibitors that help it behave normally day-to-day. Memories and thoughts are still not stored during this process, so your f pets were likely unaware they were doing those things. It is very scary to witness, but it is also a common part of the anesthetic process for many individuals.   Stage three is when an animal becomes truly and deeply anesthetized; we want to perform surgery on or euthanize animals in stage three of anesthesia because brain activity beyond the basics of life support (breathing, heartbeat, etc) is not really present. The transition from life at this point is peaceful; a drug needs only to interfere with a basic life function to help an animal pass.   I'm so sorry if these words have been upsetting, but you really can help your pets pass with dignity. The procedure can be unpredictable, but I have never personally experienced the excitement phase during euthanasia (despite witnessing it many times in surgery). This is because the anesthetic process for euthanasia is not the same as for surgery; we understand an animal should not wake up after euthanasia, so we can use different kinds of anesthetic drugs, or bigger dosages given more quickly, to hopefully skip the second stage.  To prevent your past experiences from happening again, I would choose a different vet; you mentioned seeing two for multiple animals, but it's possible both employ the same anesthetic protocols. I recommend a mobile veterinary clinic or mobile euthanasia clinic if your community has one; your vets are likely great, but euthanasia clients are some of the most common cases seen by mobile clinics. It's only natural that, when you do something over and over, you become more familiar with it. Something else you can do is confirm with your vet that they are fully sedating an animal prior to euthanasia; not doing so is very rare in healthy animals, as it is not humane, but it has been known to happen in some lesser-developed areas due to the price of anesthetics.  We could talk about the most efficient methods to request, but this message is long enough. You must be grieving for your friend, but I hope some of this information helps you bury any guilt you may be carrying from your previous experiences. Despite what it seemed, I'm sure your animals were not aware of their actions when they passed. I hope instead that their last memory was slipping gently away, like counting backwards from 10, in the presence of the person they loved most."

Fast forward almost a year later, his fluffy hair grew out and he is quite a furry chow-husky mix. Here is a picture of the good boy for reference.  We live in Georgia and the summers here are brutal. We have taken him out on warm days to shaded patios for burgers and he didn\u2019t seem bothered, but people walking by always make comments; I.e: \u201cfluffy dog on a hot day, huh...?\u201d Or the classic \u201cman this summer is gonna be hard for him.\u201d. I have read an article on a chow breeder sight saying not to shave down their Fir because it acts as a insulation from heat and protection from sunburn, which they are prone to. We don\u2019t take him out for hikes or anything because he is an old boy (9 years old) and he would rather lounge inside.   I\u2019m confused on what to do... any advice would be amazing!

In severe cases blades are used that would indeed expose the skin, but that is never the goal. There are also options to go shorter that don't require going so short. There are guard combs to achieve longer lengths. As long as the matting isn't super severe. Leaving mats because \"it'll damage the coat\" is far more detrimental to the overall well being of the pet. As far as damaging the coat, in my 14 years of experience(in GA)  the only dogs that do struggle are the elders. And it's not that their coat didn't come back, it just took a while. With proper bathing and brushing during the grow back phase, all should be well. Take care of the skin, and the coat will reflect that."

It's not any longer taught as an important skill, but for what it does for a child's brain development.

Additionally, there is some real evidence that cursive teaching and practice helps in overcoming the symptoms of dyslexia in terms of learning to read, as compared to manuscript or keyboarding.

The whole \"facts don't care about your feelings\" thing is a huge part of why he got really big on the right.  The Andrew Neil interview is a glaring example of what most people who aren't Shapoholics already knew: Ben is actually a pretty shit debater when pressed outside of his very specific lanes, and actually has a lot of opinions based entirely or mostly on his feelings rather than facts.  I think that's a much more valuable thing to point out than a discussion of how Ben contributes to the partisan divide given his image, and given the fact that everybody basically already knows he's super partisan."

I know that affirmative action has come and gone here, but I'm not arguing about giving a leg up to those who have not experienced privilege. Rather, I would like to suggest that basing it on socioeconomic status instead of just race would do more to help.  1) If minorities are statistically prevalent in low socioeconomic standing, then providing affirmative action to all people of low socioeconomic standing would still proportionately benefit minorities.  1b) A more minor point, but doing so would eliminate sentiments of people who are white but poor that they are being reverse discriminated against. I'm not arguing that they are, just that this is a perception that cripples the purpose of the idea because it hastens support.  2) There are poor whites who are disadvantaged where a minority in higher socioeconomic standing may fill a quota and be able to qualify for (insert thing here) ahead of them.   3) By making affirmative action benefit all people impoverished, we actually treat everybody with the same dignity, but because of point 1, we avoid allowing traditionally privileged institutions from monopolizing their societal influence for future generations.   Notes:  a) I understand that there is definitely a distinction between privilege and wealth, and I am in no means trying to d an apologist for those who believe in reverse discrimination. I merely hope to highlight that within all of that bullshit may be a grain of truth.  b) I feel that this is the best way to address socioeconomic inequality because:  - educational attainment levels have traditionally correlated with socioeconomic success  - any system that highlights diversity as if it itself is a disadvantage seems to me to be inherently racist. It is not the minority status that disadvantages minorities, but the refusal of the privileged to grant equal status. By granting privilege to people based purely on economic need, it grants them privilege while both allowing its attainment to not be clouted with the ideas of determinism while also preventing those of privilege from refusing to acknowledge resultant achievements due to any perception of reverse discrimination (because right or wrong, the reality is that this perception exists).  I'm sure I'm lacking in some perspective here. I am white and grew up lower middle class, though we tasted poverty on more than one occasion.   So change my view!\n\nAssistant:"

I live in Sweden, and people can be voted out if they've done something that has been directly contradictory to their election promises. They will not, however, be punished for not succeeding with their promises, because that's to be expected. Say that someone promises that they're going to decrease unemployment by a certain amount; that will rarely be guaranteed and it won't necessarily be the candidate's fault. Take this pandemic for an example, no one could succeed with decreasing unemployment during this time and therefore the people that promised something like that prior to the pandemic cannot be held liable. Politics are just way too complex to start punishing people for that.  But, like in Sweden, I think it's fully reasonable to have a vote if the campaign promises have been directly contradicted. Let's say that a politician says that they are against immigration and then immediately begins taking actions to increase immigration radically. That's going to mean that they've betrayed their election promises entirely and have essentially tried to con the population, and therefore they can be voted out.  As for lying about history or anything like that, I definitely think that there should be more accountability for politicians to be valid sources rather than just saying something to fit their narrative. They need something to back up their claims just like news articles are supposed to have their sources. That being said, it's going to be hard to implement something like this due to the fact that it's difficult to find someone at fault. Did they have sources? Yes. Were they valid? No. It's hard to be able to judge someone else's source criticism, and the only ones who are judged on that level are people within academics, where the requirements are based on the fact that the students have been educated within source criticism. They also have a lot more time to work through their sources than politicians do in certain situations: say a press conference. I can agree with you to some extent, but I think this is impossible to implement without rendering politics ineffective due to how bureaucratic it would have to become."

It isn't inherently a problem if currency costs more than its face value. Each unit of currency will facilitate many many transactions in its lifetime, creating a much more value than they ever cost to make. Cheaper is obviously better, but most denominations would still be worth producing even if they were a lot more expensive.  Which is not to say that the penny is useful enough to justify its cost. It's value is so low that there are very few transactions these days that truly benefit from its presence. My point is just that there's nothing special about them costing more than 1 cent."

Gender is primarily a social construct (see note at the bottom for those who disagree), and as such is defined by your society and culture. There are a handful of cultures that do traditionally have third genders, and if you were raised in one of these, then I am highly likely to accept your exotic gender identity.  &#x200B;  The following genders exist:  * men/boys * women/girls  &#x200B;  Other things commonly asserted as genders are not genders.  * **transgender:** Transgender people exist, but \"transgender\" is not itself a gender. They were one of the above two genders, and now they're the other one. * **agender:** To assert \"I have no gender; I am agender; agender is a gender\" is a logical contradiction. I said that there are two genders, but I didn't say that everybody belongs to one of them. There are two genders, and you can belong to neither. (\"Irreligious\" is not a religion.) * **bigender:** A similar counting argument can be given. \"I have two genders; I am a man and a woman; I am bigender\" implies logically that bigender cannot be a gender. As per agender, I didn't say that everybody belongs to exactly one gender. There are two genders, and you can belong to both. * **gender-fluid:** I don't doubt that gender-fluid people exist; I know some. The Earth has a northern hemisphere and a southern hemisphere. The fact that some people want or need to travel between the hemispheres occasionally doesn't create a new hemisphere. * **intersex:** You are confusing biological sex with gender. * **demigender:** This is usually a term which encompasses one or both of bigender or gender-fluid, but with a skew towards either man or woman. For example, someone who identifies with both genders but is mostly a man, or someone who alternates between both genders, but mostly a woman. As such, the same arguments apply.  &#x200B;  In general, apart from the two genders I listed at the top, the other categories that people sometimes assert to be genders may be valid categories of people who exist, but that doesn't mean they are genders.  To further illustrate my point, if someone were insistent that their gender was Canadian, and it seemed important to them or they provided evidence of it, then I would certainly accept that they were Canadian, and might even pay lip service to accepting their Canadian gender, especially if they were a nice person (which most Canadians are), but I doubt I would truly be convinced that Canadian was actually a gender.  &#x200B;  \\[ Note for those who think gender is defined biologically rather than socially \u2014 when you are talking about someone and don't know whether to address them as \"he\" or \"she\", how often do you pull down their pants to check? How often do you sequence their DNA to check? Or do you, like the rest of us, rely mostly on their style of dress, hair cut, and other non-biological cues? \\]\n\nAssistant:"

They emerge from biological constructs, and are used primarily because it allows for the inclusion of interaction effects without specifically modulating every possible interaction.    Regardless, gender is a social construct. One that is informed by biological factors and influences biological factors. There is a great case for an epigenetic imprint of gender, which would explain how this social construct affects the individual     https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6400866/  More than that though, you\u2019re conflating gender identity with gender. While these constructs are often related, they are not the same thing.   Gender identity is related to the internal construction of the self. In people with gender incongruence, the neurobiological construction that represents the self, in transgender people, is inconsistent with their actual bodies.   This is why transgender patients that were born female but identify as male often experience \u201cphantom limb syndrome\u201d where they can actually feel a penis that never developed.   Conversely, transgender patients born male and underwent medical transitioning to construct a vagina are substantially less likely to report sensations of a phantom penis after penectomy.   For reference, more than half of cisgender men who undergo a penectomy (for a variety of reasons include penile cancer) experience phantom limb syndrome whereas less than a third of transgender patients experience phantom limb sensations after the procedure.   As for your footnote on \u201chow do you choose what pronouns to use if you view gender as biological\u201d, I ask.

I live in a country I was not born in, and hope to eventually die here too. My parents, sibling, relatives, friends, acquiescences and work colleagues all place immense value in travelling to as many countries as they can, before they become infirm and too old to fly by plane. Their FB and IG feeds attests to this. Out of loyalty to my relatives and friends, I go with them on holiday abroad every year, or even twice. Often a new country, sometimes a destination of my choosing. The truth is, and I will never admit to them, I absolutely despise going on holiday, and I'm deeply suspicious of people who make their love of travel, a central part of their personality.  When I'm reminded of a holiday I have undertaken, triggered by a conversation topic or seeing an old photo, no emotions of the places are elicited in me whatsoever. Except perhaps the reminder of the frustrations that inevitably come with travelling by plane. The Sagrada Familia is just a fancy looking church to me. The Angkor Wat felt so much smaller, and less significant up close than when I read about it. San Francisco wasn't overrun by pissing and shitting vagabonds, as Reddit would like me to believe, but the city's charm was largely lost on me. I'm no foodie, eating \"authentic\" cuisines means little to me, sushi in Japan was certainly better than anywhere I can find in London, but I don't pine for it. Pizzas, pastas and gelato weren't even better in Italy, just different.  My positive memories aren't things I've seen, eaten, walked through, explored, touched or smelt. My positive memories abroad almost always involved the people I travel with and care about. I already get their company back at home. And little actually to do with where I am. When left on my own devices, I much prefer to stay in my hotel room drinking tea and reading my kindle.  When I do ask people why they love to travel so much, I only get the same cliche answers: the food, the sights, the climate, immersing oneself in a foreign culture (this last one can come across patronising, in honesty). When I ask them if they learnt anything from the experience, or had it changed them for the better, I get even less convincing answers, if any. \"To broaden my horizons\" is one, but the fact you went in the first place already suggests you were well up for opening your minds anyway.  I do not imply that people who enjoy travelling are boring. No. But too many people I've met certainly put this front and centre as their most interesting attribute, naming all the cities they visited as some sort of accomplishment. \"I love to travel\" tells me as much about someone who says they watch Netflix, play video-games, loves walking and listening to music.  I can already anticipate some of the replies: I honestly don't think I'm (too) boring, I have so many different hobbies and varied interests, I don't have all the time in the world to fully invest myself in each. I'm not so closed minded of different cultures, I live and enjoy working in one of the most multicultural cities in the world, and teaching myself to speak two languages. I find it easy to find something in almost anyone interesting, and worth talking about. I can hold a conversation about them, until we both exhaust ourselves. But if they want to just talk about their gap-year backpacking trip to Thailand, I simply cannot relate to them on an emotional level. That subject, and cars, are probably the only two I cannot maintain much enthusiasm in.    I wasn't sure where I wanted to put this post, could have been /r/unpopularopinion, /r/rant, or /r/offmychests. But I decided to post here, because I honestly would like to understand why you might enjoy it so much? What is it about it that excites you, the subject makes me feel like an alien. I do feel an little bad about myself for not enjoying something most intelligent and well-rounded people would.\n\nAssistant:"

And little actually to do with where I am.  Doesn't it though? My best experiences traveling are also from people I traveled with or met there, but I think a lot of it couldn't have happened if I'd just stayed home, for several reasons:   * Travel mixes up the people you can potentially meet. I've met many interesting local or travelers in other countries that I'd have no chance meeting otherwise.   * Travel gives you localized goals you can share with others, friends and strangers. I got close with several people while trying to get to a remote town together, climbing a mountain, etc. This may not be as significant with family, but with friends, we normally don't really have any mutual goals at home, just static interaction.   * Travel adds entropy to your interaction. Seeing things and people that are different from what you're used to, as well as the little surprising experiences that can happen to you while traveling (\"we missed the bus, asked a kind stranger and ended up having dinner with their family\", etc.) can enhance your interaction with people you care about.   * Travel makes it easier to experience the day-to-day mentality of people living in places you're unfamiliar with, which, beyond just being interesting, I find helps me reorganize my own life and ideas about what it can or should look like.  I think it's possible to overlook all of those things when traveling, and maybe that's what happens to you, and it's also possible that you just genuinely don't like it; but for me, I can definitely justify every day of leisure travel I've had in the past decade."

                "content": " So, copyright law and fair use in particular is kind of my area, so this should be fun.  >The original content creator decides they do not like the YT creator for whatever reason. Do they have the right to selectively file DMCA take downs against people they do not like personally?  Generally, yes, as long as they could have filed a takedown notice to begin with.  You're getting hung up on two separate issues here.  The first is the question of whether the takedown is valid generally, the second is selective enforcement of copyright based on personal objections or morality.  So let's first deal with the validity of the takedown generally.  (1).  Can Let's Plays be Taken Down Generally?  The answer is murky mostly because copyright law hasn't really dealt with the copyright status of \"original work plus commentary which still presents the entire original work in full.\"  There's a lot of interesting stuff to get into with \"transformation\" of the work and *Campbell*, which I would go into but we'd be here all day.  But the general question is whether the new work \"supplants\" the original work, or is a wholly new work.  The easy example is that you don't read a review of a movie in the New York Times in lieu of seeing the movie.  It can influence your decision, but fundamentally what you get out of the review isn't the same thing as you'd get out of the movie proper.  This is stuff long-established in case law (*see e.g. Gaylord v. United States*, *Worldwide Church of God v. Philadelphia Church or God*, and *Infinity Broadcast v. Kirkwood*).  And there's a pretty easy distinction to make between \"can access part of the original and all of the commentary\" and \"can access all of the original and all of the commentary.\"  So if we accept that the purpose of a video game like Firewatch is to receive as a piece of narrative storytelling, the addition of a particular person playing and giving commentary doesn't change that.  And we'd arrive at it being a \"derivative work\" rather than fair use.  *Cariou* makes a mess of things, I don't want to get into that but under that standard one could make an argument that all playthroughs are fair use, but *Cariou* also represents a circuit split and will need to go up to the Supreme Court to hash it out.  So let's assume that the take-down of playthroughs *generally* is valid (as it would likely be if we ignore *Cariou*).  (2).  Can An Author Issue Take Downs Arbitrarily and Selectively?  Yes, 100%.  In the same way that they can license work selectively, and only give permission to some people to make merchandise, or others to make translations.  If let's play videos are fair use, it doesn't matter.  If they're *not* fair use, the original creator can license, and revoke the licensure of, whoever he wants.  >If the Firewatch creator could successfully take down in this case, any game dev would be able to DMCA take down content due to negative reviews of their game.  Well, no.  Like I said at the beginning, regardless of the Circuit you buy into there is a clear protection for *reviews*.  A let's-play video is arguably (and I'd say likely) something very different."

In principle we could fit every government on a spectrum going from: the rule of the one (monarchy, dictatorship) to the rule of the few (aristocracy, oligarchy, elective aristocracy), and finally the rule of the people (democracy).   What we observe is that the most \"effective\" form of government is the rule of the one, things get done in a dictatorship. However it comes with significant downsides, most notably the whole \"absolute power corrupts absolutely\" thing, but also the fact that the ruler has his own inherrent biases and preconceived ideas on certain topics and they may affect the course of the nation unchallenged.  Next if we consider the absolute democracy, where every voter can vote on every issue, well it used to be unthinkable for anything beyond a small village. These days it might be achievable through technology. However, for a voter to make an informed decision on every issue, it would take a significant amount of time out of the average citizen. It is already hard enough to do so every X years for an election. This could never become an everyday thing, you would end up doing the job of a congressman on top of your actual job.   This is where we need to reach a compromise. We could vote for a king, but the dangers mentionned above remain, also the vision for the nation would be susceptible to a complete 180 every election cycle.  That's why, most democratic governement today implement a form of government which Is intended as an \"elective aristocracy\". The intent is to have everyone vote to decide who \"the best people to govern\" are, and have them make everyday decision in our stead for a set period of time. Since the whole government does not change at once, it retains the ability to work towards a shared vision.   This is where we reach your CMV. What are the weaknesses of this form of government and why is it failing today? Is \"democracy\" as it is implemented today to blame?   While I agree with you that the system in the US is rotten, and that it might very well spread to other nations fast, I will attempt to shift the blame from the model of government as a whole to a more targeted cog in the system if you will.  Normally, if the people we elected turn out not to be the best people to govern, we could simply vote them out and make a better, more informed choice next time right? It is an effective feedback loop.  In principle yes but that is dependant on a few factors. Most importantly:  1. The people need to be made aware of the failings of the leaders. Imagine a corrupt senator, as long as the people do not know about his corruption, they can't act on it. It would be obvious in a small town, but a major nation? You need an inquisitive and free press that the people can trust to relay the information to the people so the feedback loop is complete. If the press is corrupted by the powers that be, or if there is much contradicting information everywhere, the people will not be able to obtain or recognize the truth and the feedback loop is broken.   2. The population need to be educated enough to be able to render reasonable decisions every election cycle, and now additionally weed through a bunch of disinformation.    What I'm getting at here is that the model of government we see today is a well thought out compromise, and it was not always this broken. Circonstances changed and now the major challenge facing democracy in the age of information is information itself. Maybe the solution is a change in the model, maybe it is a change in the way information is allowed to spread, or something else entierely.  Hopefully this helped you in your reflexion!"

                "content": "\n\nHuman: CMV: Modern Art is not \"Real Art\" and using the argument that it's subjective is a poor argument. I'm talking about art like simply a random latrine, random globs/strokes of paint, a cup of water being placed on the floor, etc.  The argument for modern art seems to be two-fold, one art is subjective and thus anything can be art as long as I believe it is. And two trying to define what is and isn't art or trying to put a label on it is too constrictive and squashes any changes in innovation and art style.  My first point I'd like to bring up is a misunderstanding of the definition of subjective, contrary to popular belief it isn't synonymous with opinion. All Opinions are Subjective, but not everything that is subjective is based on opinion.  What is Subjective can indeed be based off one's personal feelings and impressions that however does not mean that subjectivity DOESN'T have form.  Subjective simply means the impression of an object is based on the frame of reference and impression on the subject, and thus it may not be the same as another person.  If I witness the same event as another person. My recall of the event is Subjectively different than the other person, (Even more I attach an interpretation.) HOWEVER it does not mean the scene we did not witness wasn't real and exist outside us.  Basically what I'm saying is while it's true that art can be subjective in HOW we interpret it and what we think of it, the object of the art itself that we are interpreting is an actual object. I would also like to point out even two people's different subjective interpretations may be different and may not 100% fall into Objective reality. That our Subjective interpretations still have a form or mode of reasoning behind them. One can have a system of logic that is consistent and built on reasonable axioms, but these self-system of reasoning can still be divorced from external reality, this is the difference between Philosophy and Science. While both are trying to be consistent and logical in modeling the world, Science is attempting to verify with external observation, that if repeated by different subjects will yield similar results. (Thus is independent of the subjective experience of the observer.)  Thus I submit that simply saying that anything can be art because it's \"subjective\" is like confusing how one views a work, with the work itself. (This get's into debates of course of the author's intent vs the audience.) I also feel that one can have Form and still be Subjective (Since one argument is trying to apply form to something ruins the subjectivity.) Even if something is made to not be photo realistic or give a perfect impression of reality (Like Impressionism) It still has a form, the form is simply a creation from the artist's own impression rather than an imitation of reality. To use an example if there was a theoretical universe with different laws of physics then the ones that governed ours, that universe would have an inherently different form than ours and if it didn't exist only exist in the mind of the subject, in other words it is neither objective nor empirical but it has form. Even many subjective forms might try to imitative objective reality in one way, but choose to ignore or exaggerate certain elements to bring that element of reality to the forefront never the less, it still has form.  To Simply say anything can be art, is too in effect destroy the purpose of having a word, which is too distinguish and identify one idea distinct from another, if everything can be \"art\" what is even art if we cannot compare it against what \"isn't\" art. Even if we try to say \"Some art is more artistic then others\" can we really do that if we don't have something that \"isn't\" art at one end of the scale as a point of zero.  When you literally cannot tell modern art from a random glob of paint on a canvas, I have to ask how does one discriminate what pieces of art are more \"valuable\" than others, what one's we choose to put on display and celebrate, and if art is truly only decided by personal opinion, then how can one truly say how valid one interpretation of art is over another, unless it has some form to compare one's interpretation to.  To go more deeply into the \"defining what is and isn't art\" shuts down creativity. I say this, there is nothing to say that definition cannot change and evolve, or that muliple different \"forms\" cannot be added. However it is another to say that definitions ought to be flexible or that there can be alternate forms, and that there is no definition or forms at all. Without them you lack a language and no way to communicate. Like it or not, definitions primary purpose is not to \"ruin people's fun\" it's so we are all on the same page and can communicate, definitions can change, but the two parities must understand the semantic meaning between the word. (Even if one disagrees with it at least they understand what the other is TRYING to say.)  TL;DR one must not use Subjectivity as an excuse that art should not have form, and one must not confuse the concept of form as a legalistic inflexible system, but as a toolkit to build your own interpretation or style. (Style in of itself is something we try to recognize based on reoccurring elements, patterns, or motifs that mark an individual, group, or system of ideologies presence.) Reality is one form, but one can have a form without it lining up 100% with reality, and there can be many different forms that don't follow the same rules, but they do follow rules, the rules are simply different from subject to subject. (In short rules and forms can be subjective themselves and not simply an interpretation or opinion of the same rules.)\n\nAssistant:"

Because, strangely enough, this conversation has been happening since time immemorial and there are those who would agree with your view. They are those who would destroy it. Where you situate yourself in that conversation, where you position yourself within it, is interesting. But to try to state a position within it, without understanding the conversation, proves that you haven't thought it through.   >Even if something is made to not be photo realistic or give a perfect impression of reality (Like Impressionism) It still has a form, the form is simply a creation from the artist's own impression rather than an imitation of reality ...] Even many subjective forms might try to imitative objective reality in one way, but choose to ignore or exaggerate certain elements to bring that element of reality to the forefront never the less, it still has form.  Here you're cribbing Plato. Well, sort of cribbing Plato, you haven't gone totally bug-nutty on the ideal form of a flower, but you're more or less making his case. There's there's the flower itself, the actual flower, growing in the dirt. Then there's a photo of the flower, a thousand photos of the flower, trying for representation. Then I paint the flower. I try to paint with perfect representation. I won't get perfect, but I attempt for it. Then I can go out into abstractions of the flower (like Monet, like an impressionist). Maybe I paint a cubist flower. The petals are coming out the stem, round shapes are refracted and disordered into rectangular forms, but at the end of the day, I still have a flower. But then I take my cubist painting, hand it to my impressionist friend, and he paints an impressionist form of my painting. Now, we're still painting the flower but we're painting and impressionist rendition of a cubist's rendition of the flower. Is it still a flower? Hmm...maybe. But then I give that painting to my abstract expressionist friend and he draws a big, yellow streak down the canvas, takes a green line and cuts the yellow streak at a diagonal.   And he says, \"Behold! My flower. It is art!\" And you say, \"No, a bridge too far, that's just two fucking lines of paint\".   And many agree.   **It is not about form**. That's where your argument goes off the rails.   Art has form(s). Form doesn't define art. Art is the relationship between sign and signified. If you give an eight year old an Iphone and send them out in a field, they will take a picture of that flower. But we also agree photography is an art form. What makes my cousin's shitty photo of a flower just a flower photograph versus a photo we'd hang in a gallery? What makes a Georgia O'Keeffe painting different than a bad, finger-painted daisy? It's not a set of rules, a sense of style, technique, or form.   **What makes something 'art' is when it transcends the boundaries of sign and signifier**. Art is what happens when you can signify MORE than the connotative value of the sign.   **Here's a word-based example**: no matter what, I can't make you feel what I feel, right? Like, we both see the color blue but there's no way to prove that my subjective experience of blue is the same as yours. Yet, we know there's a similarity because we both see the same \"blue\" things as blue. But I can't jump inside your head and share your vision. At least, not yet. So if I want to express how I'm feeling, I can't just use connotative language. After the miscarriage, I felt sad. That descriptive, it is accurate, but it doesn't make you feel anything. After the miscarriage, I felt depressed. I felt crushed. I felt hopeless. All true, all descriptive, not making you feel my pain. After the miscarriage, my sadness was like cottonmouth in a sandstorm. Metaphor (or simile in this case) is not descriptive. By taking something that does NOT connote, is not literal, but in fact creates a gap or space in meaning, you create an emotion. You still can't feel what i feel, but you will feel something and that something is closer than I could gt you by descriptive language alone. You explain feelings, you create emotions, within the space that can't be descriptive, that is subjective, that defies regular connotation. It's the difference between the finger painting and the O'Keeffe.   **Here's an art example**: [Abstract Expressionism looks like a lot of shitty paint on a canvas. But it was an attempt to answer this question: how do I paint the atom bomb? How to I paint the holocaust? How do I paint fascism? How do I paint my feelings after the miscarriage. Artists using this form did NOT want to represent things. They did not want to paint a mushroom cloud and say, \"Look, there it is\". They went back to primitive forms, to what they thought of as a kind of Jungian, collective mythology of violence and desire. If you think of surrealism as representational dream landscapes, you can think of AE as a kind of non-representational way of visually embodying a nightmare.   **Why was it art and not just paint thrown around?** Because when people looked at it, they didn't see the paint. They saw the nightmare. The art communicated to people that vastness, the blackness, the despair, the frenetic energy, the walls closing in. They looked and the message got across. Not because they were told to feel that, but because the art and the mood connected to the audience.   **But then we take it a step further** and we get to the glass of water on a table. Normal glass, tap water, little placard (*Still* by Exis007). Or you get a Zebra suspended in Listerine ala Damien Hirst. You want to say, \"I look at that and it means fucking nothing to me\" and I'll agree with you. The edge of art has always been, will always be, a kind of con-job. Like...how far can we take this, how much can we push, how esoteric can the communication be and still \"work\" in the sense that working is connecting to the audience. Love or hate that fucking zebra, I feel something when I look at it. What I feel is something akin to rage, but I feel...something. I don't feel anything when I look at my cousin's shitty finger painting. Is it art? I don't know.   **You want there to be rules**. But that misses the point. You want it to work like math, like physics, like logic. But that can't happen because art happens in gaps, in subjective experience, in what we feel but cannot rationally explain. I don't know why WCW's The Red Wheelbarrow fills me with sorrow, but it does. I can't explain it. I can explain the form, I can break it down in terms of historicism, I can analyze the line breaks and the twisting and how the little trickle of information brings out a sense of foreboding. I can tell you HOW he does it. I just can't tell you why.   >I have to ask how does one discriminate what pieces of art are more \"valuable\" than others, what one's we choose to put on display and celebrate, and if art is truly only decided by personal opinion  That's just the metric. Sorry. \"Value\" isn't subjective. Value is decided by auctions, by what people will pay. So, that's objective inasmuch as it is a show of hands. If Billy will pay 10 million dollars for the Listerine Zebra, that's what its worth even if you'd have to pay ME 10 mil to let you put that thing in my house. And, as for what goes in a museum, we all collectively decide that too by a show of hands. People pay other people to decide what will trigger an emotional reaction. If they are good at their jobs, people come. If they are bad at their jobs, people won't come and museum closes. You want a better metric. So have a billion people before you. They want to define it, to say what it is and it isn't, to apply rules.   And they've failed. Every time. Because inevitably someone comes and puts a glass of water on a little pedestal, calls it *Still* by Exis007 and someone feels...something. Rage? Curiosity? It hangs in their brain, it haunts their dreams. It said SOMETHING to them. It was more than a glass of water because it meant more than what it said.   And that's the ballgame."

If you want to challenge that part of my view, fine, but I'd rather have a focus on the 'transrace' concept. I'm a POC, and while I would be somewhat more skeptical of 'transrace' people than transgender people (which is in part due to stigma and in part due to the lack of research that has actually been done into being 'transrace'), I don't understand why so many people who believe being transgender is valid are so quick to dismiss people who say they are trans-race.  * Trans people experience gender dysphoria, the 'cure' for which is to transition. Hypothetically, if a person felt physically and mentally uncomfortable with their own appearance to the degree of dysphoria in terms of race or ethnicity, would the 'cure' not be to transition to a different race? * Many people say that trans people don't necessarily need dysphoria, just the desire for society to perceive them as a gender that isn't the one they were assigned at birth. In this case, if someone wanted society to perceive them as another race/ethnicity, is there any significant difference? * It's true that being a part of a certain race or ethnicity isn't a 'feeling' but rather more of a cultural experience, or even just a different appearance from other ethnicities or races. However, many people could argue the same about gender--there isn't any way to 'feel' like a certain gender outside of the cultural experience and societal perception. * Having people be trans-race isn't technically harming anyone. Acknowledging trans women are women does not harm cis women, and I feel that being transrace could even be considered less controversial, just because there would be no arguments about sports or bathrooms or other transgender 'hot topics.'  I do realize that there are a lot less people claiming to be trans race, and there is a lot less history backing it up, but I don't think it can entirely be dismissed because of the strong pushback against it--I'm sure that fifty years ago, many transgender people were closeted too. I also realize there's almost no hard science behind it, but it's so quickly dismissed that I don't believe it's even been studied seriously.  Please CMV.\n\nAssistant:"

Basically, maybe I'm really crazy but America promoted Capitalism, which is to say they promoted having a good quality of food. They kept improving their stuff such that it became a competition of quality against quality rather than quality against quantity. This created the unintended affect of people becoming very greedy, unwilling to share cause the quality of their food was top notch so giving it away felt like a burden.   On the opposite end of this was the U.S.S.R. They fed everyone but the quality was barely sub par. This, combined with higher ranking officers getting a better quality of life, led to a stigma where the lower class citizens would get lower class food.

There are a few points I will make right off the bat:  * It's well known that the body positivity movement is primarily catered to those who are overweight/obese, this specific group and message are what I will be specifically discussing. While this movement does include things like skin conditions, burns, etc. These are not things someone can generally change, and are irrelevant to my argument. * Acceptance of ones weight regardless of the size is one of the founding principles of this movement * I do not believe anyone is morally in the wrong for choosing to LIVE an unhealthy lifestyle themselves. My qualms are with those that PROMOTE an unhealthy lifestyle as healthy to others. * I do not believe it should be anyone's goal to meet any sort of socially constructed beauty standards * I was born in and reside in the U.S. so due to that my examples and beliefs are directed there.  Okay now that those are out of the way I can begin (PLEASE make sure you read everything thoroughly before commenting)  It is my belief that the current body positivity movement is actually more damaging to the health and lifestyles of those in society. The current body positivity movement promotes heavily the acceptance of \"all sizes\" this is directed of course to your weight. This is damaging because it convinces people to simply accept whatever stage they are at in life weight-wise and it promotes stagnation. No matter how tolerant you want to be, it is illogical and unscientific to deny that at some point weight becomes a health factor/problem. This movement is essentially saying that you need to ignore these things and simply accept your weight as \"who you are\" and it claims that trying to lose weight through a better diet, exercise, etc, is only due to a need to fit into these hypothetical socially constructed beauty standards (I say hypothetical because the topic of beauty standards is something that is still debated and i dont want to take away from my point in this post). This brings me to my next point which is that beauty standards are not primarily the reason someone who is overweight is going to want to lose weight; and even if it is there is nothing inherently wrong with someone who wants to look better and feel better about themselves as long as they are doing so in a healthy manner. By healthy manner i mean proper meal plans, exercise, changing bad habits, etc. This movement tries to demonize anyone who is trying to actively change themselves for the better so that those who are in stagnation and just accept where they are at can feel better about themselves.  Now here is my idea of what the body positivity could and should be. I imagine a movement that encourages people to NOT accept where they are and to continuously try to better themselves physically and mentally. In all aspects of life if you stagnate and stop trying to improve you will stop making progress, why should we treat our own bodies any differently? at what point did it become bad to encourage a healthy and active lifestyle? Obesity is a huge problem that has gotten exponentially worse in America which everyone can agree on; and while there are many aspects to this problem i believe that lifestyle choices are THE PRIMARY reason. I think we need a positivity movement that encourages you to live a better and healthier lifestyle! Not to meet some stupid social standards but instead so that as a society we can live healthier and happier lives. The current movement does not encourage this and would rather you resign to whatever current condition your body is in. I think true body positivity is being able to love yourself enough to put in that extra effort to live a happier and healthier life.   This is my view, I am always trying to hear and consider all sides of a discussion so please, try to change my mind!\n\nAssistant:"

The first thing is to stop getting your opinions on fat acceptance from youtube and pop media. Of course they bring the worst on. Seriously, I only say this because it is quite literally about becoming a healthier and better person, and the 'stagnant acceptance' is what I see when they bring on the people who appropriate the movement to justify their weight issues, which is there 99% of the people who post this CMV get their views from.  I'm just going to use myself as an example. I was 175kg, extremely depressed, hated myself, all of that fun jazz. The thing about being fat, and this is something people just don't get, including some fat people, is you aren't fat because you want to be. You aren't fat because you're like 'yeah, this is a good idea, I love this'. It's not even about stuffing your face too much because you can do that in a healthier way and lose weight.  The reason that fat acceptance exists is because it stops making being fat about how we look and it makes fat about what *we* want. It's about not being judged by others and being ourselves and only being left with the facts of our health and what we need. And when I accepted I was fat, and focused on stopping hating my body (I still struggle, I have pretty bad stretch marks and so on), I began losing weight immediately.   People think that making people ashamed and afraid and anxious about eating will stop them doing it - like that's just not how it works! Like, there is study after study after study piled on top of common sense about what we know about fat people in our own lives. You might meet one person who copes by saying how amazing it is they're fat, but most fat people you probably know in your life are deeply ashamed of their weight, so clearly, *shame isn't helping*.  Fat acceptance was how I and many other people lost a ton of our weight. Am I still fat? About 30kg over where I want to be, sure. But I'm over 50kg lighter than I was before."

Which is greater: 5.5 pints, 94 fluid ounces, or 3 quarts? How many square yards are there in an acre?   At the very least, most people would fumble a bit before seriously answering any of these questions. Maybe even use a calculator or reference guide. At worse, some people would not try or be able to answer some of these questions.   The Imperial System is obviously very clumsy and confusing to use even for Americans. This is the reason why the United States of America should finally stop using the Imperial System of measurement. To be fair, there are two other countries that also use the Imperial System, and they are Liberia and Myanmar (Burma).    These three countries should instead use the Metric System. The Metric System is superior to the Imperial System for three reasons.   First, the Metric System is simple to understand. The simplicity of a base 10 system of measurement, such as the Metric System, makes it extremely easy to understand especially when dealing different scales of measures, such as meters versus kilometers. For example, it is obvious that 100 meters is 1/10 of a kilometer. No serious thinking is necessary.   Second, calculations in the Metric System are also easier. This is probably why most researchers, doctors, and scientists use the Metric System even in the United States. For example, which is greater: 989 grams, 1.1 kilograms, or 1 million milligrams? How many meters are there in a kilometer? How many milliliters are there in 1.25 liters?   Third, the Metric System is the international standard. This is probably the most important reason. Car manufacturers already realized that having similar parts in different measurements for different countries was a waste of resources, so all cars are now built using the Metric System for redundancy eliminations and cost reductions. Furthermore, all goods exported outside of the United States have to be label in metrics, or else they can not be sold. N.A.S.A. actually lost a $125 million dollar spacecraft, called the Mars Climate Orbiter, over the planet Mars, because one team was using the Metric System and another team was using the Imperial System. That was a very costly mistake that could have been avoided if everyone in the world used the same system of measurement. Since over 90% of the world uses the Metric System, it is by default the international standard.    The Metric System has been proven to be far superior than the Imperial System, so why hasn't the United States of America converted? I believe it is NOT because Americans are afraid of the Metric System, but rather Americans are concerned over how painful the conversion process would be. In the long term, I believe the benefits and cost savings to convert to the Metric System would greatly offset the short term inconveniences.   As a result, the United States of America should finally and completely stop using the Imperial System of measurement for the Metric System that has been proven to be simpler to understand, easier to calculate, the international standard, and reduce redundancies, errors, and costs.\n\nAssistant:"

Metric. Etc etc.  Where metric hasn't been adopted, there clearly hasn't been a huge *reason* to adopt it. e.g.,:  * Street signs? How *often* do you need to convert miles to feet, and feet to miles? At what level of precision? Sure, I agree, 5,280 is super arbitrary... but it doesn't stop me from knowing that 500 feet is about .1 miles, which is all I need to understand my GPS. Where's the driving reason to convert? * Recipes? Sure, if I want to get scientific about it, I'll weigh it all out in grams and ml ... but outside of baking (where many have already switched), how often is that the case? Most recipes are based on ratios, and \"1/2 a cup of this, 1/4 of a cup of that\" is intuitive and simple, and *would not benefit from more precision.* Where's the driving reason to convert? * Carpentry and construction? Sure, I get that it's easier to *conceptualize* cutting a meter in half and getting 50 centimeters than it is to conceptualize cutting a yard in half and getting 18 inches, but using a base 12 system and fractions is generally actually easier *in real life* than using a base 10 system and decimalization, because the cuts you're doing aren't arbitrary -- they're generally in half, quarter, or thirds, which (in Imperial) all come out to nice round numbers that are themselves easily divisible. Half a foot? six inches. A third of a foot? four inches. A quarter of a foot? three inches. Etc. What's the driving reason to convert?  The Imperial system's main advantage is that its units of measure are intended to make it easy to do day-to-day hand-tasks (like gauge traveling distance, or make soup, or build a dresser). That's the *reason* it's so inconsistent -- but it also makes it very sticky, and means that adoption of metric tends to happen quickly *where it makes life more convenient,* and happen much more slowly where it doesn't.  Cases in point: you mentioned the US is one of only three countries using the imperial system ... it actually isn't. It's one of many countries having *incompletely converted.*  * Height and weight? Those'll be in feet and inches anywhere in North America. Weight'll be in stone in the UK, for crying out loud ... *and* they use feet and inches for height. * How fast are you going on the highway? Canada'll use km/h... but if you're in the UK or America, or anywhere in the Carribean, or you're a railway system anywhere in North America (which is expensive to convert), speed of a vehicle is measured in miles / hour. * Buying gasoline? For some reason about 30 countries have decided to use gallons for gasoline, even if they use liters for everything else. * For that matter, buying beer? You still buy that in pints in a dozen countries (but what \"pint\" means differs).  Basically, the more benefit there is to having an innate sense for what a measurement \"means\", and the less detriment there is to having to do conversions, the less likely it is for people to make the shift."

One of the concepts that I've always disagreed with is \"robbing kids of their innocence.\" I just don't feel like time spent being innocent is important to have a fulfilling childhood. Also, kids that did have their innocence taken away early on - such as the age of 4-12 grow up with more maturity and develop better ability to handle complex situations effectively.   I understand this could put a lot of pressure on young minds and could have detrimental effects - some situations where I would treat the child as an adult vs. where I wouldn't;  If I can afford food, clothing and shelter, then I will explain to my child if we are poor/rich and how it impacts us. If we are barely scaping by, I would try to make them understand that while its unfair, its how life is right now - that things can change.   I would teach my kids about death as a natural process if a distant relative died, but I wouldn't tell them their dog died because that could cause emotional trauma.   These lessons would have the most impact on a younger mind, I would have to be careful not to say anything disturbing but I believe its well worth the effort.  I believe you should take away a child's innocence if it can be done in a healthy way.   \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  My dad was blunt with me, he ran a business and would come home stressed when his accounts receivable was adding up. We had bills and mortgage to pay and he was very transparent about not being able to meet payments. It made me value money more, question why things cost as much as they do and I think I have a better understanding than others from an early age.   While it did cause stress, it gave me a head start when compared to the blissfully ignorant kids that could not understand why their parents wouldn't buy what they wanted - these were the kids saying shit like \"my moms a b\\*tch.\" When my dad said NO to buying an Xbox, I understood and didn't pester him, I didn't throw a tantrum because I understood he would have bought me one if he could. My innocence wasn't robbed, I was taught the importance of spending when you don't have it. Later down the line, I did end up getting an Xbox, just had to wait an additional 8 months for my dad to have that kind of discretionary spending (\\~$400).   Should I not take opportunities to teach my kids about gender inequality, stereotyping, financial stability, death, being born lucky, war, drug abuse, or grandparents going senile? (just some examples off the top of my head).   All for the sake of innocence, which I just don't see any benefits to. I feel like it should be my parental duty to teach these things in a warm and supportive environment and not let life be the only teacher.  &#x200B;  CMV reddit.\n\nAssistant:"

Being a kid is confusing and I think people who share your view have the good faith opinion that by being completely honest can help this. For example, you mentioned explaining to your child your financial situation. Being honest isn\u2019t going to make it any less confusing, in fact it might just be more confusing as children do not fully understand how the world works. You need to understand that those young ages are crucial for emotional and mental development including logic, reasoning, deduction. Keeping things light and innocent for the most part can give their little brains time and space to focus on the emotional/mental things they\u2019re sorting out.   I am not a parent but I have a degree in neuroscience with a minor in cognitive science. I worked in a research lab for a little bit that focused on adults with anxiety and/or emotional dysregulation disorder secondary to C-PTSD. We see a pattern with adults who have C-PTSD. PTSD does not have to be a result of intense trauma or abuse. PTSD can manifest from the constant worry of ones security and stability as a child. As I said before - too much worry about the how\u2019s, what\u2019s and when\u2019s as a child puts them into survival mode and they fail to learn how to regulate emotions among many other things.   I do not think that you seeing how stressed/worried your father was as a child was healthy. Now, please understand I am not saying that you as an individual are not healthy, stable or \u201cnormal\u201d. I don\u2019t know you or the whole story. But my from a psychological science stand point, it\u2019s not healthy for a child. Bottom line. It sounds like you turned out lovely and I\u2019m happy for that. But there is such a fine line and since we can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on the child\u2019s brain, why tip toe it? There will be plenty of time to teach these lessons. My parents struggled a lot when we were children and we had *no idea.* But when I was six and I didn\u2019t understand why I couldn\u2019t have a bounce house at my birthday party like Becky down the street, my parents took it as a learning opportunity. They sat me down and explained to me that some families have more extra cash than others. They made sure I understood that because they love me, first priority is making sure I have the clothes I need, the food I eat and the roof over my head. If it were up to them, they would buy me everything I *wanted* but at this point in time there isn\u2019t a lot of money for wants once the needs are taken care of. When I asked why some families have more money than others, my dad told me it was the jobs they chose. They didn\u2019t make a lot of money, but they didn\u2019t work a lot of hours either and that meant more time spent at home. I understood and hearing no in the future was easy but I still never had to worry if my needs would be neglected. They taught me not only the value of a dollar but also planted the seed for learning the lesson of valuing my time later in life.   Let kids be kids. They have their whole life to worry about stability/security. There\u2019s actually a nice little inverted bell curve that shows as children we feel safe/secure/stable. We lose that sense around the time we go to college and it doesn\u2019t return until around 50-60yo. Just some food for thought. If you\u2019re thinking \u201cWell that\u2019s my point! Maybe they would still feel secure/stable once they leave for college if I teach them about the real world at a young age!\u201d Even the best parent who prepares their child before leaving home by teaching them everything about the world isn\u2019t going to change this. Nothing is promised and the future is unknown which is why most people reported having the sense of insecurity. Once you reach your 50s, you\u2019re usually secure and probably headed for retirement so the future is pretty clear.   Be honest and teach lessons but consider not letting your future children see the \u201cadult struggles\u201d you deal with as an adult. That can be scary and confusing at a young age!  Edit: I also want to add that I\u2019ve thought about how my parents raised me quite a bit. If I had realized how much my parents struggled despite having college degrees, I would have probably been more hard pressed to get a graduate degree or become a doctor. I am in grad school but that\u2019s because I want an advanced degree. Because I enjoy my choice of study. Had I decided to just get a bachelors, that would have been fine too because poor or not, my parents were always one thing: *happy.*"

Hi folks.  I think it's commonly acknowledged that many pet owners are not fit to properly care for their animal.  Quite aside from active abuse, there is significant passive abuse that has been normalised in western cultures, e.g.:  * Leaving co-dependent pets locked alone in small spaces for much of the day * Providing poor quality, excessive or insufficiently varied diets * Providing insufficient mental or physical exercise * Raising animals in conditions that are antithetical to their natural environment (this is a little subjective, perhaps) * Selling or giving away co-dependent pets when they no longer \"fit for purpose\"  So my dangerous idea, that seems to be quite unpopular amongst everyone I've talked to, is that pet ownership should be regulated and licensed in much the same way as human adoption. It seems odd to me that we bring these animals into our lives to raise them, essentially, as our children, but we don't seem to confer on them the same living conditions as we would a child.  This view does not necessarily cover service or working animals, that's a whole different matter.  Why do I want my view changed? Two reasons:  1. I have locked horns with some of my pet-owning friends about this; their argument being that such regulations would restrict their freedom to own a thing that they want (which is precisely the point). I want to understand where they're coming from, and either they don't have the patience to articulate it in terms I can understand, or I don't have the patience to understand how they've articulated it. I'm not sure which. 2. I would really love to get a dog or cat as a companion animal, but as a city dwelling, working single person, I feel very far from being able to morally do so considering the above. If it were my job to set the terms on which a \"pet license\" is granted, my current lifestyle (and that of most city-dwelling single folks) would not pass muster. **That said, please keep in mind that my CMV appeal is about the wider issue of pet ownership, not my view that I shouldn't get a dog**.

The U.S. did not abandon poorly conceived military adventurism, however, as you probably noticed.  They just created and all volunteer force to wage wars.  The result, twenty year long conflicts in the Middle East that the average American barely cares about.  This would not be possible if the U.S. had a conscript army.  Secondly, notice who joins the military.  It is largely people with poor education and blacks and people of Hispanic origin are over represented.   So, essentially the U.S. is getting the poorest and most at risk members of its population to do the most dangerous work.  Were the U.S. to reintroduce compulsory conscription, it would be a great equalizer.  The sons and (possibly) daughters of the most affluent and privileged would literally rub shoulders with the most marginalized.  I could imagine that would do a lot to decrease the polarization that the U.S. is currently experiencing.  This will not happen, however.

In India, they use a whole different set of spices. In China, there are even two different words for spices called La and Ma (edit see below). One is fiery like capsaicin and the other, referring to Szechuan pepper corn, is electric like a battery on your tongue. It's amazing.   **Edit:** side note: people seem really curious about Szechuan peppercorn. It actually used to be illegal in the US but as of 2005 you can now buy it   The reason salt and pepper came to grace restaurant tables with all those other spices out there is **French cooking and Louis XIV. **  At the time that formal dining came into fashion, French culture was influential throughout the western world. Louis XIV was an influential man as the king of France. He didn't like as much salt or pepper in his food but others did so he created the custom of having his chefs put it on the table rather than cooked in. The custom spread and western culture helped spread it all over the world.   Edit: black pepper contains piperine not capsaicin.  Edit 2: Chinese is hard. La (not Lada) and Ma are more nuanced and appear to refer to different things. La is the word spicy generically.

And usually the reason it is happening is because of the body's failure to keep the body completely and entirely paralyzed.    It most of the time takes place during the part of sleep where we more often dream (i.e. REM sleep). During this time, you body is supposed to *actively* paralyze *all* your voluntary muscles (i.e. \"skeletal muscles\"). In other words, your body is making sure you can't move, primarily, it is thought, to make sure you don't act out your dreams.  Probably so you don't kill/hurt yourself pretending to do various things.    With many people, this active paralysis isn't as complete as it should be.  So occasionally people talk.  But since talking isn't per se that dangerous, there's probably not a lot of pressure for it to be eliminated (throughout the many generations of people).     Most people who talk, usually don't say very much or say it very clearly/coherently.  And usually only talk briefly.

It takes far too long and too much specialisation to reach the level of skill/knowledge on something that would make you globally notable these days.   As mentioned by others here, what makes them notable is their *relative* knowledge levels compared to the rest of the world. They didn't know much, but jeez, compared to everyone else back then, they knew everything. And they got there without the internet, supportive government and societal infrastructure, and without a lot of the inspiration we have now.  That sort of knowledge and skill monopoly concentrated in one person is unlikely to happen again, due to the sheer amount of time and effort it takes to be the best at something these days; to be great at something means sacrificing the necessary time to be good at something else. Also back then they didn't have electric lights, appliances, modern transport, communications and information infrastructure we have; just daily life was so time consuming that there was far less time for creativity and learning. The standard of skill and knowledge among everyone else was far lower. The amount of free time we have now allows people to specialise in a skill and reach levels of proficiency in months what would have taken years for someone many years ago, there are now people with after-work hobbies that are better skilled at them than people who were once considered the best in the world in that field.  EDIT: A lot of people have taken my view of Da Vinci as that he was not an incredible genius with equally or even more incredible drive and focus. This is not my view, he was indisputably an unprecedented genius who hardly slept and worked incessantly. If Da Vinci were alive today, he would almost certainly be still doing very notable things. The same goes for other classical geniuses: Newton, Einstein, Galileo, Bach, etc. However,  my point is that in today's context, they would be doing truly amazing things in one or two fields only."

Also, lost track of what sub I was in and made this not very Explain like I'm five years old.  Sorry.  Internal computer memory (RAM or Random Access Memory) is built and accessed in multiples and powers of two (binary).  You still buy computer memory sticks in capacities like 512 MB or 2 GB.  These aren't really \"real\" mega- and giga-bytes because in the old days computer people borrowed some metric terms like kilo that meant exactly 1000 and used them as a shorthand to refer to 1024.  Even today, some operating systems and programs (and programmers) still use the \"wrong\" 1024 value when calculating both computer memory and storage.  When computer hard disk drives were invented, they weren't electronic structures built on powers of two, so the marketing people used the \"correct\" multiples of 1000 when talking about storage capacity (decimal).  If nothing else, it makes the capacity look slightly bigger, and marketing always likes bigger.  Marketing also really likes round numbers.  So hard disk drives are advertised in terms like 250 GB or 2 TB.  Solid state drives are internally more structured like computer memory (built in binary) than mechanical hard disks (measured in decimal for convenience).  A 240 GB SSD probably has a \"raw\" storage capacity more like 256x1024x1024x1024 bytes (and 8x that many bits).  So why not call it 256 GB (using the old binary method) or even 275 GB (using the newer decimal method) SSD?  Again, marketing people like round numbers.  Also, the buying public (as opposed to just computer geeks) has figured out that hard drives never seem to have the full storage capacity that is advertised.  With old mechanical disks, this was mostly due to the binary/decimal measuring difference.  With SSDs, it's mostly due to something called over-provisioning.  So, the marketing people pick a smaller round number that more or less reasonably reflects the actual usable space.  Over-provisioning is when some of the SSD storage capacity is marked as off limits right from the get go.  Your 256 GB SSD has 16 GB set aside for future use, leaving 240.  If the SSD internal control electronics notices that sector 18 (for example) is developing a fault, it will copy the information to a new sector in the 16 GB.  Old sector 18 will be permanently disabled.  The new sector 18 will be marked as in use.  The SSD's total amount of storage, as reported to the end user, remains the same at 240.  A 480 GB SSD is probably a 512 GB SSD with 32 GB of over-provisioning.    I just did a quick search on Amazon and I see 240 GB, 250 GB, 256 GB, and 275 GB SSDs from different manufacturers which I'm pretty sure all have the same amount of actual storage, so it's not like the marketing people are consistent.  edit: some numbers formatting"

Wild animals eat a ton of random roughage, berries, roots and plants while domesticated animals eat mostly corn and silage.  There are other threads you can search for on eli5 which corroborate this. Here's a quote from the University of Michigan  > Venison refers to the meat of antlered animals such as deer, moose, elk and caribou. The 'wild' flavor of venison is directly related to what the animal eats. Corn fed deer will have a milder flavor than those that eat acorns or sage. The 'gamey' flavor is more noticeable in the fat. Removing the fat, connective tissue, silver skin, bone and hair during processing lessens the 'gamey' taste. However, undesirable strong flavors are due to inadequate bleeding, delay in field dressing or failure to cool the carcass promptly  https://www.extension.umn.edu/food/food-safety/preserving/meat-fish/gamey-flavor-and-cooking-venison/"

Most sweet foods contain either sucrose directly, or \"high fructose corn syrup\" which, is a mixture of fructose and glucose all mixed together.  Carbs are mostly just long chains of glucose, and enzymes happily cleave off glucose from the chains and use it. So carbs become sugar, but mostly, become glucose. This is energy for the whole body, every cell.  The difference comes with fructose.... remember the sucrose is a source of it.... When your liver processes sugars, it makes fats and cholesterol. This is \"de novo lipogenysis\" which is just the fancy latin way of saying \"the creation of new fat\".  The thing is, remember how I said glucose is food for your whole body? Because of that, only a small percentage <10% ever gets processed by the liver.  Fructose however is not an energy source for every cell. Fructose is processed in the liver, and 90% of it goes there. Fructolysis is the process: > Unlike glucose, which is directly metabolized widely in the body, fructose is almost entirely metabolized in the liver in humans, where it is directed toward replenishment of liver glycogen and triglyceride synthesis.[1] Under one percent of ingested fructose is directly converted to plasma triglyceride.[2] 29% - 54% of fructose is converted in liver to glucose, and about a quarter of fructose is converted to lactate. 15% - 18% is converted to glycogen.[3] Glucose and lactate are then used normally as energy to fuel cells all over the body.[2]"

In developed countries with stable and reliable grids they are rare, but in places where the infrastructure is not really fit for purpose you may end up in situations where there is more demand for electricity than you can supply with the power plants you have.  Normally you have vast interconnected power grids where these things can be even out across many different countries and also have power plants that stand by and can be brought online to make up for the shortfall.  In some cases such as isolated power grids on islands, places with poorly maintained infrastructure and developing countries you may find yourself in a situation where there simply is not more power to be had.  If the operators in this case the operators have a choice. If they do nothing, physics happen, the frequency of the electricity on the grid goes down and either breaks a lot of stuff or causes things to automatically shut down to prevent being broken. This would mean no electricity for anyone for a long time.  The other choice is to cut of some customers until the remaining demand matches what you can supply. Critical infrastructure like hospitals etc and things necessary to keep the grid itself running are not going to be cut of.  You could either pick a neighborhood to have no power for a day or you can pick 24 neighborhoods to have no power for an hour each one after the other to lessen the misery by spreading it around.  That is a rolling blackout. The are that gets blacked out rolls around and affects most people for a short time.  It is not good but better then the alternative.  However many people in many places especially ones where corruption is rampant will pointed out that poor neighborhoods seems to be more likely to be hit by that supposedly equal spread of the blackout.   There are also odd cases like the whole Enron thing in California in the US a while back where fraudsters deliberately caused a problem with supply by shutting down plants that were perfectly fine and thus caused the need for blackouts  to make money.

Here goes:  My parents divorced in 1997 due to my father's serial adultery and financial lies.

Since that time, I maybe spoke to him once or twice.  We have not exchanged words in a decade.

I have requested many times that this brother and his wife do not tell our father about my personal life.  And yet, they have told him personal details about my relationships, my job, etc.  I went no contact with them, but they still receive information through my mom.  The chain of fuckery goes like this : ME > MOM > BROTHER > STALKER.  This week he sent a completely unhinged letter to my work address, where it was received and opened by a coworker.  (It's a government office and pretty routine for us to receive personally addressed mail due to the calls we get, so this isn't surprising or out of the scope of their job).

I'm filing a police report and a TPO, but I doubt the TPO will be granted because his physical violence and abuse took place 20 years ago and because my mother is so conflict-avoidant it went undocumented by police.

Literally didn\u2019t even acknowledge the fact that he was in the unit like by saying \u201canyone home\u201d or anything. I was about to pepper spray the fuck out of him because his back was to me and I was home alone.   Today he said he needed to do maintenance on the a/c and proceeded to crane his neck to look in every room with a door open and rummage through my cabinets in my kitchen.   I really don\u2019t wanna be THAT tenant but I can\u2019t do this for a year. It\u2019s always just him telling me some small shit that could have been said over the phone.

One is for my family, one is for my in-laws, and the other 4 are rented to paying tenants.    Our lease clearly says no pets are allowed except service dogs.  However, one of my tenants, who happens to be a sheriff's deputy, obtained two small dogs (I believe they are chihuahuas) last month.  My in-laws, who live next to them, started complaining about barking.  So I sent them a notice saying they have 30 days to either rehome the dogs, or they can end their lease if they desire.    He texted me and said can we meet to discuss this situation.  So I said sure, come over to my apartment.  I thought he was going to claim they are service dogs or something.  But when he came over, he was in normal non-uniform clothes, but wearing his gun.  He walked into my apartment and said something like this: look, I don't really care what the lease says, my wife got these dogs and I'm not going to make her remove them.  I said I'm sorry it doesn't work that way, you have to follow the lease.  Then he put his hand on his gun, and said if you want to make an issue of this, there will be serious consequences.  I was kind of shocked and didn't say anything, and he left.    Now I'm not really sure what to do, to be honest I don't feel safe with him around, but I don't want to piss him off and cause problems for myself either.

This rate has increased significantly over the past few years, when the fee was first charged it was fifty or sixty dollars and only for seasonal visitors.

My employer deflects all complaints by explaining that everyone in the organization pays, from the president on down. Which is true, but I imagine when you make $150k a year you really don't miss it.  Recently, most employees were promised a raise. However the *parking benefit* will also be increasing (in what is probably an equivalent amount but we're not sure yet).

With regard to the first amendment, there is a limitation on that which schools do enjoy. (See, for instance, Tinker v. Des Moines).

My room is on the bottom floor next to a machine room that houses elevator machinery and a boiler.   Beginning in September, a loud, 2-second pulse of a high pitch beep began going off every 8.5 seconds and it is followed by a higher-pitched but slightly quieter beep. The original beep is coming from the room next to mine and the secondary beep is coming from the fire alarm control panel near the entrance.   It is loud and you have to call somebody to shut it off. No maintenance is available after 5 pm or before 9am or on the weekends. So if it goes off in the evening, you have to hear it all night. If it goes off on a Friday night, you have to hear it all weekend. It prohibits me from sleeping, studying, and (I work from home) working in my apartment. I am a student at the University here and the invasiveness of this noise makes me go home every weekend so I can sleep in peace. it is so loud, due to it emanating from right next to my room, and high pitched that you can hear it with white noise playing, tv on, etc.  The frequency at which it is going off is increasing. It used to be once they shut it off it would be a week before it went off again. Now, it goes off again within the hour of them shutting it off. Sometimes, when they are called the maintenance people do not even show up because they are sick of it and I can hear them complaining about me in the hallway. I literally heard one of them say they don't know how to fix it.   I have been repeatedly lied to and/or mislead about the causes of this noise. At first, I was told it just happens sometimes. Then I was accused of vaping and setting it off (I quit vaping in June before I moved into the apartment and have never vaped or smoked in my apartment). Then I was told it is going off because other people are vaping in their apartments. Then I was told the boiler in the machine room is overheating and that is what is causing it.   And now I am being told that the smoke heads on the detector are faulty and they were replaced last week. The alarm went off all weekend and is going off again today.   However, the message on the fire alarm control panel says \"fire trouble\" a quick Google search of the system suggests that this is an electrical issue with the system. A post on the fire alarm subreddit had people telling me that it needs to be fixed by a certified technician not the apartment maintenance staff and that they likely are unaware of the root cause of the problem.   I was originally told they will move me to a new apartment if they cannot fix the issue. Then I was told they will not have any available units until January and they asked for more time to fix it and that in the mean time they will find me a unit in case they can't.   Today, I was told I am not being moved. And that the issue has been fixed. I had to come back with a recording to show them it is not and they acted confused.   I would like to be moved.  The lease states they will if there is cause and they already said they would move me before going back on it. My guess is they got a tenant for the unit they were going to move me to originally.  I would even consider breaking the lease and moving however rent has gone up in the area and leaving would represent a significant increase in monthly rent.  I called the fire Marshall and made an anonymous complaint. I would like to know what other remedies I can pursue on my own.

He did not hurt her or her two kids (ages 5 and 2.5) but physically destroyed several things around the house before she called the police. He was arrested and charged with domestic battery and destruction of property. There is currently a restraining order on him to stay away from her & the kids until his court hearing Monday.   I had no idea the extent of it because she kept it all from me (I live several states away so it wasn\u2019t all that difficult), but apparently his anger issues and destructive tendencies have been a reoccurring problem for basically their entire relationship (about 4 years). So this has not been a one-time incident, but rather hallmark DV over the course of several years.   Her husband has a gun (my sister thinks it\u2019s a Ruger 9mm but I don\u2019t know for sure) that my dad sold him within the state of Utah a couple years ago. According to my dad, no paperwork/registration was needed for a gun sale of that nature in the state of Utah. During the course of the DV, he would often threaten to shoot himself or harm himself with said gun. My sister told me she would hide it in various places around the house to keep him from getting to it, and would keep the ammo in a completely separate location from the gun. (I know how incredibly dangerous that is with two young kids, even if gun/ammo are separated. If I would have known...) She is incredibly fortunate (if that\u2019s even the word to use in this kind of situation) that no one has been seriously injured or hurt because of the gun [yet].  I know she needs to get the gun out of her house ASAP, but I also know that she needs to make sure it is 100% above the table and also won\u2019t have any repercussions on any future custody/divorce proceedings that could somehow weaken her case or chances at getting full custody of her child.   A few questions:  1. What\u2019s the best way to get rid of this gun? 2. Would there be any potential repercussions in divorce/legal proceedings if she sold a gun that was his?  3. Can she even sell it? Not having paperwork for a gun sale or not having to register it at all just seems really weird to me, but I know nothing about gun laws.  4. In the meantime, if she isn\u2019t able to get rid of it altogether, can she give it to a trusted friend for safekeeping until she can speak with a lawyer and figure out how to proceed?  He is a legal US resident but does not have citizenship (I don\u2019t know whether this affects anything, gun-wise or otherwise).\n\nAssistant:"

First of all, I live in Washington state. I recently moved into an apartment -- about a month and a half ago. Tonight, I had someone knock on my door with a camo tactical vest and a taser. Mind you, I wasn't aware at the time that he had these items. He was standing to the side of the peephole. When I opened the door he asked me, \"Is Amara there?\" I said, \"I have no idea who Amara is?\" He then proceeded to ask me other questions. I noticed the taser. That's when I said I don't have to answer your questions and shut the door in his face. Before the door shut he blasted into my apartment with his taser out. I called 911. He searched my premise. I then realized he was a bounty hunter. He never identified himself, nor did he have proper gear on. Which I know is against the law (but the officer didn't care because his partner had the right vest on. Which WASNT the one who entered my premise.) The girl who skipped bail didn't live at my address anymore. The only \"proof\" they have is that this is the residence she listed or last lived at. How is this okay? How is this acceptable? I'm a new fucking tenant. I didn't sign that stupid paper to get rid of my rights. The police said no crimes were committed and I didn't get to file any complaint (except the one that was generated automatically I assume?) Is there anything I can do? We frown at vigilantes yet we allow these thugs to run around and intimidate and harm innocent civilians. Bounty hunters are disgusting.\n\nAssistant:"

In such cases, the relevant statute says the agent must:  > (a) Have reasonable cause to believe that the defendant is inside the dwelling, building, or other structure where the planned forced entry is expected to occur; and  > (b) Notify an appropriate law enforcement agency in the local jurisdiction in which the apprehension is expected to occur. Notification must include, at a minimum: The name of the defendant; the address, or the approximate location if the address is undeterminable, of the dwelling, building, or other structure where the planned forced entry is expected to occur; the name of the bail bond recovery agent; the name of the contracting bail bond agent; and the alleged offense or conduct the defendant committed that resulted in the issuance of a bail bond.  It's quite possible the police were aware of the planned entry and that's why they won't let you escalate this and don't believe any laws were violated.  Even if it was unplanned though, so long as they notify the director of licensing, you really have no recourse here."

During his drive, he was hit by another vehicle, who immediately took off. He chased her but eventually lost her after she got on the highway. He has a dashcam (front view only) so he has her license plate number. He stopped somewhere nearby and called the police.

Since he was covering another location that night, he was told he didn't have any more available days off and worked the rest of the shift. After work, he went to urgent care on base nearby the house since he's in the reserves.    He had a ct scan done. Called up his insurance which says he has to pay a $500 deductible in regard to the car, but he hasn't called her insurance since his phone died. He was told to not go back to work for another 5 days, but he doesnt have anymore days available to get off, so hes going to work for the rest of his work week (Friday - Tuesday nights) I'm asking him to stay home, but he's adamant on working even though he keeps having back pains from an old injury he received while in the Navy that's now resurface because of this. He's currently asleep (just got home) so he hasn't called her insurance nor the gas stations corporate office about his accident.

They asked that all parents be careful when taking pictures of their kids and to not show, share or post any pictures with her in them and to edit her out if we want to post them online or otherwise keep them.

Like actually crazy - talks about aliens and randomly cusses in his backyard at invisible people. Turns out he also likes to shut off people's electricity.  I live in a townhome where our electrical panels are outside the building and unlocked. A few months back, my power went out and I had no idea why so I called an electrician since none of my breakers were tripped. Turns out the outside panel was switched off.  Weird, we figured it was a neighborhood kid or something.  But the panel happens to be close to one of the windows where I work, so now I'm on the lookout for my building in case it happens again.  Turns out it's a full grown man. I was in disbelief at first and just shouted 'why' out the window and in response he flipped me off and ran away. Keep in mind I recently moved in so nobody should have a beef with me so far, especially not somebody I don't even know.  I called the police and they told me since the panel is an open access panel no crime was committed and it is a civil matter. I was a bit shocked that anybody can turn off our building's power without consequence.  I asked around, and turns out people in my building know him. Local crazy neighbor. So now I have his address and name.  My question is, what can I do if he keeps shutting off our power? Our HOA said they would look into adding a lock for the panel but are concerned about emergency access with a lock so they may not add one.  Off the top of my head I considered suing for damages if he shuts off my power while I'm working from home or something, just to have him face some sort of minor consequence. Just really surprised it's not a criminal act and not sure where to go from here. I can think of a lot of actions to remedy this that aren't legal but I'd love to hear what I can do legally.\n\nAssistant:"

She is salaried and I work on commission, paid a draw abd then my commissions are to be paid out monthly. I put in my notice two weeks ago because I haven't seen commission since February. With my notice I noted that the state law around termination of employment for a commissioned sales person is that they pay me 100% up to date within 30 days of my last day.   Today I received my commission statement and when they figured my draw against my commission, for the first time in five years, the deducted my wifes salary in full from my commissions. So effectively, I paid her for the last 5 months instead of the company.   My CEO says we discussed this but we definitely never did. What does my recourse look like here if he does not correct this? I'm in Missouri and he is in California if that matters.\n\nAssistant:"

Now my relatives are foaming at the mouth trying to get their hands on the records and are threatening to take me to court. Hey reddit... Well, like the title says, we lost my aunt in January. It really wasn't totally unexpected but it was still really hard to deal with. My aunt didn't have any kids of her own, so her nieces and nephews were her kids. She was close to all of us and she was really like a second mom. My aunt loved her vinyl collection and we'd listen to her records and talk about her favorite bands together for as long back as I can remember. Before she died she told me she wanted me to take the records and her turntable and made me promise not to sell them which of course I said I wouldn't. I took them with me at her insistence maybe several days before she passed.  Since the funeral I've finally sat down and looked at all the records with my best friend who's a huge vinyl lover. It turns out that some of the records in her collection are worth hundred and or thousands of dollars. It was kind of cool to find that out but again, no big because I promised I wasn't gonna sell.  Well I made the mistake of telling my sister....who then told my mom....and now word has leaked out to the other neices and nephews. My mom is telling me that it isn't fair that my aunt left me something so valuable and that it isn't right for me to keep what she says is a small fortune to myself. The others (my aunt's two neices and nephew that aren't my siblings) are saying that I had no right to take the records and that I need to return them before they get the court involved. They said that we can settle the matter out of court if I agree to take the records to an appraiser, sell them, and split the amount from the sales with them with a portion going to everyone and that it's what my aunt would've wanted because she loved all the kids equally.  I don't think so. She gave these to me and not them and they just want to sell them because they want the money. My question is can they take me to court? I don't want to sell them but I don't know how any of that works.   Help? Anyone?  tldr: my aunt left me very rare and valuable records. My family didn't care until they found out how much they were worth. Now they're pissed at me and trying to pressure me to sell them and are threatening to take me to court.\n\nAssistant:"

Here's the thing, anyone can put up a rare record for sale for thousands of dollars, it doesn't mean it will sell for thousands of dollars.

I would bet you that if you had an appraiser value them, he would not buy them for half of his 'appraisal'.  Tell them to go pound sand."

Hey so I must apologize if this post is jumbled a bit. I started typing it up in Word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today.   I think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. I know this is going to be hard to explain, but I have been having gaps in memory that I have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  I was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then I started to notice that this seems to happen when I go on dates with him.   I know it must be crazy, but I have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  I know its him as\u2026 well I wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would\u2026   The first time it happened was when we were drinking and I wrote it off as too much to drink. We get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. But then there were a few times when I KNOW we were not drinking.   I decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. I had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time I talked with him. I remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. My car and his car was in the parking lot too so I was confused.   I decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.  After 3 days at his place I remembered everything so I was started to trust him again. Knowing he was an ENT I know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. I was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said I should be treating those sores.   I had completely forgotten they were there. These little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. I got so freaked out he mentioned them that I decided to leave.   The next day he came over to \u201cCheck on me\u201d and I remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest.   Then today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. I never agreed to me with him and would never want to. He does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something I have no memory of.   I am sick and tired of it and want him punished.   This has started to affect my work life as well as I start to get paranoid when I see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. I get paranoid that they are about to fire me. My friends also state I have been acting strangely and out of character. I have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when I do.    Is there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? I do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so I want to be damn sure when I go to the police.\n\nAssistant:"

My first bit of advice is for you to get professional treatment of the bed bugs. It is not cheap, but they are incredibly difficult to get rid of. Bed bugs can survive a year or more without feeding and do cause a wide array of psychological issues due to prolonged extremely poor sleep. I sincerely hope this is the cause of your issues, but I would also talk to your doctor (not your boyfriend) about your symptoms. Request bloodwork."

I'm sorry, this is a really strange situation for me, I'd love some advice on where to go from here   On friday I was picking up my daughter at school, we live on a military base in Colorado.  The school has a small roundabout in the front for afterschool activity buses and special circumstance pickups, my daughter has cerebral palsy so I pick her up and drop her off here every day, which has been okayed by the school since it's a way shorter walk than the regular designated pick up spot and she has so many appointments that we're coming and going multiple times most days.   After I parked in visitor parking to wait for her a man dressed all in black (polo and slacks) came up to my car door and stood almost touching the window, staring in at me smiling, I turned my body away from the window to try to signal that I didnt want to engage and called my daughters phone to see where she was. The man kept staring at me so I locked the doors, he tapped on the glass and said \"I just want to talk\".  I was starting to get nervous so I said through the glass \"Please go away, you're creeping me out!\"   He immediately looked offended, walked behind my car and blocked me in, I texted my husband to ask him to please come, then started to call the school to ask for help when the parking lot monitor came up to talk to him. I see her everyday so I hung up & hopped out of the car and told her this guy was making me nervous, he yelled at me that units were on the way and that I was violating federal installation procedures. I asked the parking monitor what was happening and she said he was the school resource officer and to just go get my daughter.   I went inside and helped my daughter out to the car, the whole time I walked out he was glaring at me. I said \"I'm sorry, I didn't know you were an officer, what's happening?\"  He said I had failed to identify myself on a military installation, was belligerent, and would not be allowed to leave until more units arrived. He made me wait outside of the car and when I asked if I could go to my daughter who was scared and crying in the car he said no I needed to remain in sight. It wasnt super cold that day but still I was in leggings and a tank top and its winter in CO, we waited around 10 minutes.   I asked him to please call the principal or a school authority out to witness since he was scaring me being so visibly angry. He refused at first but after the 4(!) military police officers he called came he did contact the school. The officers talked to him and he told them I refused to tell him my name and had expired paperwork. An MP came and asked why my registration was expired. I said \"no, it's not\" and after he gave me the okay to go in my car I showed him my current registration and IDs, he said \"oh, officer XYZ must be confused\" I told him he'd never asked for my info and that there must have been a mix up since I didn't know he was an officer. He asked if he'd told me he was an officer and when I said no he rolled his eyes.  The principal came out and asked what was going on, then told the officers that I'm allowed to use the roundabout since I have a special needs student. The officers said that they could only go by what the schools officer reported and that he'd reported I was going  the wrong way down a one way (there is only 1 access point for cars).   The school resource officer was standing maybe 10 feet away during the whole exchange just staring at me until my husband showed up, then he moved across the roundabout but continued glaring at me.  The MPs ticketed me per his request but told me\"we don't see you being belligerent, you've been helpful to us the whole time but we can only go off what he says\".   The ticket says it is for \"drove wrong way on one way roadway\" and carries a $100 fine. There's only 1 way in and out for personal vehicles and theres no posted 1 way sign.    Before they left the main officer gave me a card and said *if* I were going to want to file a complaint I should contact these numbers. The principal apologized and said that he'd never seen the SRO acting this way and when we come back from break he would have a special sticker made to identify that I'm allowed to pick up and drop off my disabled student there.   I called the complaint/compliment line from the card after I got home and of course no answer, voicemailbox was full then disconnected. The sergeants number on the card just rang with no answer. I googled the main line and was transferred to him and when I told him how weird the whole thing was he just kind of laughed at me and said he'd talk to him later.  It's a little thing but it shook me up, I'm nervous about possibly  having to see him for the rest of the school year, I'm wondering if it's okay to contest the ticket and what I would say.\n\nAssistant:"
