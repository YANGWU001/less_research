    "\n\nHuman: Why do nursing schools and med school mostly teach treatment based information rather than preventive? As I was in nursing school so much of our program was treatment based, and very little was talked about prevention, for example so many people have never had a full lab test that shows all functions in the body. With the human body being so complex it feels like we arn\u2019t taking advantage of all of our resources to keep our patients healthy.\n\nAssistant:": {

NOT about the individual patient.   Most doctors are dealing with the individual patient. We (NL) actually still have public health doctors.  You are NOT talking about prevention. You're talking about early detection, and it's actually less effective at reaching the goal than you'd intuitively think.

I'm a primary care doctor practicing curative and 'preventative' (aka treatment of risk factors and screening) care... as well as meddling in actual prevention if I get the chance.",
            " My honest opinion is that while prevention is important - it should be taught in school, workplaces via HR and public health professionals. The physician's role in preventative care is very limited since prevention requires an adoption of habits that cannot be taught in a 5-10 minute meeting with the doctor or nurse. As a med student, I did learn about prevention but those that I meet now in my clinical years are not coming to the hospital or office with the willingness to pick up new habits such as walking up the stairs or eating their 5 veggies.",
            " The primary focus of these schools is to train students to become healthcare providers who can diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. This means that a lot of the curriculum is geared towards teaching students how to recognize and manage different health conditions, rather than how to prevent them.  Additionally, the field of medicine is constantly evolving and new treatments are being developed all the time, so there is always a need to keep students up to date on the latest developments in the field.  Another reason why prevention is not emphasized as much in nursing and medical schools is that there are many factors that can affect an individual's health, and it can be difficult to identify and address all of these factors.  For example, a person's lifestyle choices, such as their diet and exercise habits, can have a significant impact on their health, but it can be challenging to teach students how to effectively address these issues. Additionally, some health conditions, such as genetic disorders, are not preventable, so it can be difficult to develop prevention strategies that are applicable to all patients.",

    "\n\nHuman: I got rejected from all of my PhD programs. My parents and professors are giving me conflicting advice. Who should I listen to? I applied to grad schools for physics this past year and failed spectacularly: I was rejected from every single PhD program I applied to. There is a silver lining however: I got accepted into a master's program at a great school, and I have a good job offer in the city of my current school, so things certainly could have gone worse. Here's the issue: my parents really want me to go to the master's program, while all my professors are telling me not to go.  As far as I can tell, my parents are looking at the name and prestige of the school, and think the master's program will greatly improve my application to PhD programs. They also think that my current department has screwed me with bad advice leading up to my PhD applications, and that I'm not likely to do much better next year if I stay where I am.  On the other hand, my professors think that the master's program is not likely to help my applications unless I do significant research, and it will be harder to find research as a master's student than a PhD student. If I stay here, I have enough connections within the department to work with almost any professor here. They think that if I can get something published and get a better physics GRE score, then I should have no problem at all with grad schools next year.  From my perspective, I think the master's program would be an enjoyable experience, and would give me the opportunity to see first-hand if I really want to pursue a physics PhD, or if I'd rather pursue a math PhD or something else entirely. I'm also fairly confident that I would do well in the master's program, and could even potentially use the program as a gateway to the PhD program at the same school. On the other hand, I could easily end up in a new city with no friends, no connections within the department, and no time between grad courses and potential research to study for and do better on the physics GRE, which I think was the biggest thing holding my applications back. Not to mention, the master's program would cost an entire year's tuition. While paying for the program isn't an issue, I have serious ethical concerns with spending so much money on graduate school, when I would be paid to do the same thing in a PhD program.  If I stay here, I think I would also enjoy the job I've been offered, and if I can get some research done on the side and do better on the physics GRE, then I agree that my application would be fairly iron-clad. But there's always the possibility that I can't get anything published, or that I don't do much better on the physics GRE, or maybe even that I get a publication and better physics GRE score but no better results. In addition, funding for the job offer won't go through until May, and while I've been assured that it almost certainly won't happen, there's always the chance that the job doesn't get funded (I have to decide on the master's program within a week, so I'd be crossing my fingers that the job works out). There's even the chance that I get the job, but it doesn't leave me with adequate time to also do research, at which point I'm not sure how much better my application would be.

            " Maybe it's different for physics, but in biology a masters from a great program will go a long, long way toward improving your chances for a PhD program acceptance. Don't forget, you'll also gain access to the academic network your masters advisor has - it may be totally different from your undergraduate advisor's.  I'm a little confused by your current advisor's opinion that it won't improve your chances unless you do \"significant research\", as that's exactly what master's research is (unless this is a non-thesis masters program?). It sounds like they want you to hang around as a tech, which seems like a nonsense opinion to me - you'll probably be doing similar work, but have less to show for it than the masters, which will  (should, anyway) come with a stipend, advanced classwork, and maybe teaching experience.  Edit: Ah, I've just re-read, and I think I understand your professor's opinion, which is a key point that you glossed over: You have not been offered an assistantship for this master's program, correct? You've buried the lede a bit here; you've been \"accepted\" to a master's program but, IMO, not really. You should practically never end up paying for a grad degree (MS or PhD). If this is the case, I flip back over to your professor's side.",
            " You have to analyze why you didn't get in. Only time a MS helps is if you had mediocre grades and you need to fix that. However, exposure  can help and people who do MS in an institution do get into PhD programs in the same institution if you stand out during the MS.",

            " If the master\u2019s program did not offer you compensation/assistantship of any sort, I think it\u2019s the less ideal option for you at the moment. In this case I agree with your undergrad professors - paying for a graduate degree out of your own pocket is always, to some degree, a red flag.   You also mentioned you can still work with your professors on research, even potential publications if you work in the same city. That would be a strong support for your application to a PhD program in the future.  Besides, you mentioned you have ethical concerns about paying for the masters - more often than not, concerns like this are conflicting with a great graduate school experience.  The choice is your obviously, but if I were you, I would not consider the master\u2019s program at the moment.",
            " > I think the master's program would be an enjoyable experience, and would give me the opportunity to see first-hand if I really want to pursue a physics PhD, or if I'd rather pursue a math PhD or something else entirely.  Why do you think a master's will give you insight to see whether or not you want to pursue the PhD?",
            " I don't think anyone else has mentioned this yet, so I'll make a suggestion. Depending on how flexible your future plans are, doing an MSc can be a good step towards a PhD, for this reason: outside of the USA, much of the world still considers an MSc as a requirement for entering PhD programs. I can confirm this is the case for physics PhD programs at many Canadian and European universities.   So there is this perspective: by doing a Masters, you give yourself a second chance at American PhD programs, as well as making yourself *eligible* for international PhD programs (which often don't ask for GRE results), if that's something you're willing to consider.",

    "\n\nHuman: In academics. Should I stay or should I go? I am currently on my first year of a 3 year post-doc contract at a rather prestigious research institute. I am quite impressed that I made it this far, due to I am somewhat suffering from imposter syndrome.   So far I never had a specific career plan, just an intention of becoming a researcher. Or something. By what appears to be skill and coincidence, I bopped along, taking a masters degree in bioinformatics, phd. in genetics, and now a post-doc. No surprise when my PI asked me a rather daunting question: What do you want to do in 2 years time?  I could not honestly answer that question. I am a generalist, who inserts my brain into whatever problem I am directed at and solves the problem. I am a problem solver who likes to tinker with the technicalities in order to maximise the flow of whatever needs to flow.  I also like to teach, so I was considering if I should pursue a career as lecturer. For this I have started to ask different faculties at universities to gain insight into what would be required for that part.  But the alternative remains unanswered: My whole adult life has been in academics. I cannot fathom what I could be doing outside of academia. Any insights?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Reviewing the n-th paper about an overdone topic. What should I say? I'm reviewing for a high impact medical journal. A group submitted a paper where they use artificial intelligence to solve a specific (technical, non-diagnostic) task. This task is perfectly suited for artificial intelligence. Indeed the first papers that tried it and succeeded were from 2016.   In this paper the authors try the latest fad in neural network design and they conclude that... this one works. Like the 200 previous others with less fancy techniques.   What can I say? It's technically correct. But if it were a math journal I'd be asking for many experiments to be performed so that it shows what are the differences between this solution and the state-of-the-art ones. But here it's a medical journal, no one cares about math. Should I recommend acceptance? Then why not another 200 ones that say \"this thing that works also works if I paint my PC green\"? Should I recommend rejection just because they bored me?  Should I ask for further tests? Which ones? They already demonstrated quite well that \"it works\". Just not that it works any different from how it's known to do!  And anyway... I don't want to be the asshole reviewer!\n\nAssistant:": {

Hi all,  &#x200B;  After a frustrating year of job hunting, I was offered a three-year postdoc (humanities) a couple of weeks ago to my immense delight. Since the offer, I've had an initial formal offer letter and some communication via email with the admin people at the research institute.  &#x200B;  I've now received an email saying that the institute's director (who was one of my interviewers) would like an 'informal chat' about the post, including discussing an overseas trip to a conference around when I'd be starting the position. I asked whether I should prepare anything and they said 'no need, look forward to seeing you then'.  &#x200B;  I'm sure I'm just being paranoid but I'm freaking out a bit about what this meeting could concern. Since I'm already living in the town in which the research institute is based, my husband thinks that the director just wants to do things face-to-face and that I have nothing to worry about.  &#x200B;  Has anyone had a similar experience? Please don't judge me for being so anxious - it was so hard to get this job and I think I'm just worried it could slip out of my hands for some reason :/\n\nAssistant:": {

Anyone who has a problem with how you sound is a bigot, and you shouldn't change yourself to accommodate bigots.  That said, I suspect many of us do have a \"classroom voice\" which is perhaps louder, clearer, a bit more measured, and less casual than our typical speaking voice. Mine is geared toward being heard, understood, and respected. I would \\*not\\* change anything to accommodate someone who just had a problem with how I sound.",

This is the crux of my problem, the stress of publishing is really getting to me. I dont know how to push this process along any faster than it is. It feels like I'm really lost at sea. I keep panicing that I'm not cut out for this post -- not so much intellectually but rather just scoring the funding necessary to sustain myself. It really feels like I'm going to run into very serious problems when it turns out I haven't published enough throughout my PhD and post-doc to warrent my position and therefore \"fail\".   I think its worth noting that I moved overseas for this post and now if I don't convert the job, I'll have to move back and face the reality of being a bit of a failure.

It's a bit of a shock for them (it was for me, too), but it's definitely true.  I'm now used to writing enough that it doesn't bother me much, but the first few papers were tough.    I've gotten plenty of advice over the years for writing.  They tend to focus on 1) Make time to write every day, at least for half an hour.  2) You can do three things- outline, write, or edit.  Some days it will be better mentally to edit instead of write, but all three are necessary at various points in writing.  3) Though difficult with COVID, changing your environment can help.  I have been more inspired to write if I'm away from my main computer this year.  Once you have something you're happy enough with (as said above, co-authors help a lot!), submit and let it be.  Don't check on \"manuscript status\" every day as that doesn't help.  Rejection is part of the process, though I say that with the luxury of being tenured.

What really helped me was using Wendy Belcher's book \"Writing Your Journal Article in 12 Weeks.\" It breaks down the article revision process into microsteps that you can space out while also doing other research and teaching obligations. And there's also a chapter about how to draft an article in the first place if you don't have a draft you're working with. It has sections for both Quant and Humanities fields, so regardless of where you fall you might find it useful. Just knowing that when I wake up in the morning to go to my desk, I don't have to decide what I'm going to do to work toward publication, but instead just have to follow the next task in the sequence has taken a massive weight off my shoulders.

    "\n\nHuman: Example Tenure Letter of Rec from a Student Perspective? I was asked by a former professor to write a letter of rec for his promotion to tenure track/associate professor. I want my letter to be great because, well, the professor is great and I owe him a lot! I've searched Reddit for all the advice concerning how to write a good tenure letter of rec from a student perspective, which has been very helpful, but something's still not clicking. Generally, I'm one of those people who need an example of something before I understand how to do it, and while I've found example letters of rec from professors to students on the web, I haven't found the reverse.   Without an example letter to work off of, I'm concerned that I'm talking about \\*myself\\* too much in the letter (focusing on my experience in the classroom with the professor, how he helped me get into grad school, how much his class taught/impacted me, etc) as opposed to talking about the professor himself. But the point of such a letter is to emphasize the positive impact he has on students, right? I'm having a hard time understanding how much to center my own experience of the professor versus talk more generally about his virtues.  If anyone has any advice on how to strike this balance or is willing to share an example of such a letter (all personal information redacted, of course), I'd be truly appreciative.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: What do you think about my idea? As an academic, I'm amazed by the amount of time I spend on finding relevant scientific literature related to my work.  The process is extremely inefficient, and although different search engines make it easier (Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, etc.), it is far from optimal.  Not only that, but many good papers are lost in a sea of thousands of bad ones. It's hard to find them, and it's easy to waste time on reinventing them instead of improving them.  Our idea is to create a platform that automates this work, at least partially.  In the beginning, it would use the APIs of Semantic Scholar and other search engines, later we would implement an AI system ourselves. We also plan to limit the platform to the field of Computer Science, and later extend it to other fields.  In its simplest version, the platform would take a paper as input and output a citation subgraph with useful information extracted from it.  A citation graph can easily explode to thousands of papers within two levels, so it is necessary that the platform does some kind of selection, and some filters are provided to the users for that purpose.  Those filters would take into account parameters like, for example, the number of citations, but without penalizing recent papers with high potential.  For example, the papers could be classified into methods, applications, and reviews; so that different classes of papers are shown from the selection of different filters.  For a given paper, the platform would extract its hierarchy from its citation graph. If only \"methods\" are selected, the hierarchy would show the papers from which the method evolved from, and the subsequent papers that evolved from that method.  Here are some other things that the platform could do:  \\- Automatically find the standards used in a given field and compare methods, results, metrics, benchmarks.  \\- Evaluate the \"innovation potential\" of a given field: how much can it still be improved and how easily? How large are the improvements in that field? How many papers are published? Is the interest in that field dying or accelerating?  \\- Automatically create a summary of the implementation details for replicability purposes.  \\- Automatically find new areas of possible improvements.  \\- Allow users to open issues on papers (as it's done on Github) and implement crowd review (later).  I think that drastically reducing the time spending on reviewing scientific literature would increase productivity by a lot, but I would love to hear your feedback on this. Thank you!\n\nAssistant:": {

Most search committee members don't make it past the CV and only read the rest of the apps once shortlisted which means top 10-20%.  So getting a job is one thing, then you'll be expected to get funding and with a weaker CV and 5-10% success rates be prepared for rejections based on reviewers biases.

    "\n\nHuman: First time: How does food and drink normally work at international conferences? I know this sounds like a silly question and probably varies based on location/field, but it's my first international conference (in the US). The conference runs for a week and I know there's one reception dinner planned and one networking night.   I'm a bit stressed at the thought of having to buy lots of food every day. I can claim it back on my research grant but I don't want to go broke in the process and have to wait it out. I imagine the food prices will be pretty high judging by the hotel prices, and I just about manage at home bulk buying food and meal-prepping to keep costs down (I'm a PhD student).

    "\n\nHuman: Does getting a science PhD in Europe put me at a disadvantage for finding a position or post-doc in the USA? I am originally from the USA, but am now doing my PhD in Europe partly at a well-known research institution. I have heard conflicting reports and that some people don't look on the European PhD as equivalent because it is shorter, while others have said that there shouldn't be any fundamental difference between them. A PhD is a PhD. I came here thinking that I would just show my worth through my publications, but now I have started to worry about my future job prospects.   Have any of you had to deal with this before?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Don't address it directly. Definitely don't announce it.   If you can find another professor or two to confide in and get advice for your particular school, you can \"come out\" to them and ask for advice as you go. They'll be able to give you better suggestions than we can, since we aren't familiar with your school.   If you want/need to express it in professional ways, you can become a faculty mentor for your campus LGBT group, or similar, and stick a sticker on your door saying \"LGBT friendly\". You can add an email signature saying your preferred pronouns. Those are all reasonably professional. Other professors involved in that group may be a good source of advice for you.   I'd leave it at that.   As for clothing choice, you can probably move the line a little bit. Don't wear a dress with makeup on your first go, or at all (some female professors won't even do that!). But maybe you can adapt some slightly more feminine (\"professional\" feminine) clothes, maybe a nice/simple/solid color cardigan, dress pants from the women's section, a small delicate necklace, maybe an earring here or there. Find a balance that suits you, but avoid being ostentatious. Be aware that doing too much too fast can jeopardize collaborations, promotions, etc. Above all, remain professional, don't inject your personal life into your professional life any more than you would normally do for anything.",

            " There's lots of great advice and experiences here, which I think reflects that it will depend so much on your particular circumstances. As much as everyone wants you to be happy, be yourself, just do you, where whatever you want, they don't have to suffer the potential consequences of  working with someone who is biased or judgmental, you do.   What will this look like for you? How have your coworkers reacted to similar situations? How focused is your institution on diversity and inclusion initiatives? Are there communities on campus you could reach out to?   I'm a grad student in STEM and we have trans and gender fluid students and staff. The community has been mostly supportive as far as I've seen, or at least just treating them like everyone else. However, just be aware that all people are definitely judged on their clothing. Even though academia here is pretty casual, I notice that female students who wear yoga pants every day are not taken quite as seriously and I have never, ever seen my female professors wear anything less than business casual, whereas male students often walk around in basketball shorts and male professors can wear jeans and a T-shirt.   There are definitely double standards and the female side is judged more harshly. It's much less of a deal for a woman to wear androgynous/masculine business attire than for a man to wear a dress. That said, floral or feminine work shirts are super in and that would be easy to pull off.",

            " I think this may be a case of trying to establish and maintain healthy boundaries. It may feel like you are hiding a part of yourself by not sharing this via an email or announcement, but you do not need to announce anything to the world in order to express your gender fluidity.",

It wouldn't be an issue for my department at all (I'm the chair) but I think it would be...courteous? ...to mention this to your departmental colleagues if they don't know already.  For example, it's departmental culture for us to share pronouns during introductions at the start of a class, in any public meeting, etc. so if nothing else it would create some confusion in my department if you changed pronouns (but of course you might have already been using gender-neutral ones).  I wouldn't bother with the students, it's none of their business really. How/if you say anything to colleagues probably also depends on the size and nature of the department.

            " There's a number of elements that have to be teased out here. Firstly we have to look at the differences in the context of their fieldwork. Mead did her fieldwork in a fairly isolated corner of Samoa in the 1920s. As a young woman, she had better access to informants who were also young woman. Freeman worked in Samoa at various points beginning in the 1940s. Freeman worked in a different area and was generally more connected with chiefs and higher-ups. This time difference is also important because of increasing US influence and conversion to Christianity.  The work of either is not considered entirely discredited, even by their respective opponents. So we have to separate out to some degree this fieldwork from the accusations made against Mead by Freeman.  Now to get to the reactions to Freeman. The initial reactions and the ones that continued on throughout the 1980s were largely dismissive of Freeman. However, the most interesting critiques were probably by those who critiqued both Mead and Freeman. Some of the broad brush accusations made against Mead had some truth to them. Eleanor Leacock agreed that Mead had romanticized Samoa to some extent, but not to the extent that Freeman claimed. Bradd Shore believed the overall picture was somewhere between Mead and Freeman.  However, Shore, Leacock and others (I am also drawing on recent histories by James Cote, Paul Shankman, and Martin Orans here) demonstrate both that Freeman systematically misrepresented Mead on many points and had a number of inconsistencies in his accusations. For example, some of Freeman's own work -- statistics and interviews -- contradicted his own claims.  The biggest misrepresentation, though, is Freeman's later claim that Mead was \"hoaxed\" by an informant. Freeman misrepresented this informant as being key to Mead's fieldwork and conclusion about sexual activity. This was not true -- Mead devoted only a few sentences to her in Coming of Age. The interview which the hoax claim was derived from was dubious in a number of ways. The interviewee was with a relative of the chief and a higher-up in the Samoan government. Admitting to pre-marital sexual relations was taboo in this context. By the 1980s, many Samoans considered pre-Christian social practices (esp. pre-marital sex) to be a sort of dark age period and mentioning them was dishonorable. The manuscripts of unpublished interviews show inconsistencies in the informant's testimony as well. Recent histories of the controversies all consider this hoaxing idea to be entirely discredited. Even Orans, whose *Not Even Wrong* was a huge criticism of Mead, was at pains to show that the hoax hypothesis was false. Cote, Shankman, and Orans are unanimous on the fact that Freeman distorted Mead's work.  Also, Freeman like to portray himself as a level-headed scientist fighting against lunatic ideologues. Freeman himself was however not purely calm and rational during this controversy. He bullied his opponents, even trying to have some of their doctorates revoked.

I love history, learning about cultures, and travel and took an Intro to Anthropology class during college which I found fascinating and loved.

What subfield of anthropology makes the most money? I'm especially interested in archaeology, forensic anthropology and bioanthropology.

    "\n\nHuman: Thinking of going back to University to obtain a degree in biological anthropology, emphasis in forensic anthropology. For those of you who work in the field what have been the pros and cons? Do you feel satisfied in your work to non-work life balance? I have a BA in Psychology specializing in addiction. After spending a year in research I knew I would not go towards a masters degree. I had a great deal of fun in my studies at University but found the opposite when entering the work force. Very little money, mostly due to not obtaining a masters or PhD, and I found it hard to compartmentalize my work non-work life. Outside the field of addiction the jobs I qualify for are mainly reception or general office work. I find no satisfaction in this.  I have for a long time been interested in the field of forensics and rolling the idea of forensics anthropology around as a future career. However, before I were to take on any more student loans I would love the opinions from some of the anthropologists out there. From the research I have done it is recommended to go in to the field knowing you will probably need a masters or PhD to gain access to the more prestigious careers. Have you always found this to be true? Are there more jobs than just museum work or becoming a professor? For those of you working in the field what have been the pros and cons? Also, do you feel satisfied in your work to non-work life balance?  I have many questions, but I will leave them at the few I asked to not overwhelm.

A 1.77 million year old specimen from Georgia for example had lost all but one tooth due to age or gum disease, the earliest example of severe chewing impairment, yet still survived for several years afterwards. Similarly a 1.5 million year old specimen from Lake Turkana had juvenile spinal disc herniation - which caused some scoliosis (abnormal spine curvature) and likely left the individual with lower back pain and sciatic (limiting his ability to walk, run and bend)(Haeusler et al. 2013). Nevertheless, the specimen appears to have survived into adolescence, suggesting some kind of group support.  Well-healed fractures on many Neanderthal bones similarly indicate the setting of splints, while individuals with severe head and rib traumas (which would have caused massive blood loss) indicate they had some manner of dressing major wounds, such as bandages made from animal skin (Spikins et al. 2019).

            " Strictly utilitarian views on human societies are generally not very useful from the perspective of understanding human behavior, because they ignore the fact that people in human societies are **people**. Not robots.   >**But hunter gatherers need to be constantly on the move.**   First... Hunter-gatherers aren't \"constantly on the move.\" While mobility strategies vary *significantly* across time and space-- geographic region, environment, population / group size, etc.-- most ethnographic data suggests duration of occupation of locations ranges from a few weeks to a season to-- in the case of sedentary hunter gatherers in extremely rich environments-- indefinite periods of time.  In my opinion, the biggest disservice that 1950s through 1970s hunter-gatherer ethnographic studies did to our concept of hunter-gatherers was to frame hunter-gatherers *in general* in terms of groups like the Hadza, who live in relatively marginal environments. Evidence from around the world suggests that in a significant number of cases-- perhaps the majority-- hunter-gatherers occupied fairly abundant environments.  Second...  >**They need every hand available in order for the tribe to survive.**  Viewing people in a society purely from their utilitarian value is not justified or appropriate. People are more than the number of calories they can produce.  Members of hunter-gatherer groups provide other value to their groups besides simply how many palm fruits they could carry today. But even from a strictly utilitarian perspective, older and less mobile members of a group have significant value. Children may or may not be able to leave the camp. These less mobile members of the group can provide child care. They can also assist with tasks in-camp.  From a less utilitarian perspective, older members of a group represent a source of knowledge and experience. They are the institutional memory.  >**Now in such a situation, what happened to people who were old and sick? Hunter gatherers did not have the tools or the infrastructure to carry people around on a long term basis, right?

        "sft_target": " Strictly utilitarian views on human societies are generally not very useful from the perspective of understanding human behavior, because they ignore the fact that people in human societies are **people**. Not robots.   >**But hunter gatherers need to be constantly on the move.**   First... Hunter-gatherers aren't \"constantly on the move.\" While mobility strategies vary *significantly* across time and space-- geographic region, environment, population / group size, etc.-- most ethnographic data suggests duration of occupation of locations ranges from a few weeks to a season to-- in the case of sedentary hunter gatherers in extremely rich environments-- indefinite periods of time.  In my opinion, the biggest disservice that 1950s through 1970s hunter-gatherer ethnographic studies did to our concept of hunter-gatherers was to frame hunter-gatherers *in general* in terms of groups like the Hadza, who live in relatively marginal environments. Evidence from around the world suggests that in a significant number of cases-- perhaps the majority-- hunter-gatherers occupied fairly abundant environments.  Second...  >**They need every hand available in order for the tribe to survive.**  Viewing people in a society purely from their utilitarian value is not justified or appropriate. People are more than the number of calories they can produce.  Members of hunter-gatherer groups provide other value to their groups besides simply how many palm fruits they could carry today. But even from a strictly utilitarian perspective, older and less mobile members of a group have significant value. Children may or may not be able to leave the camp. These less mobile members of the group can provide child care. They can also assist with tasks in-camp.  From a less utilitarian perspective, older members of a group represent a source of knowledge and experience. They are the institutional memory.  >**Now in such a situation, what happened to people who were old and sick? Hunter gatherers did not have the tools or the infrastructure to carry people around on a long term basis, right?

A 1.77 million year old specimen from Georgia for example had lost all but one tooth due to age or gum disease, the earliest example of severe chewing impairment, yet still survived for several years afterwards. Similarly a 1.5 million year old specimen from Lake Turkana had juvenile spinal disc herniation - which caused some scoliosis (abnormal spine curvature) and likely left the individual with lower back pain and sciatic (limiting his ability to walk, run and bend)(Haeusler et al. 2013). Nevertheless, the specimen appears to have survived into adolescence, suggesting some kind of group support.  Well-healed fractures on many Neanderthal bones similarly indicate the setting of splints, while individuals with severe head and rib traumas (which would have caused massive blood loss) indicate they had some manner of dressing major wounds, such as bandages made from animal skin (Spikins et al. 2019).

    "\n\nHuman: Guns, Germs & Steel - can I trust ANY of it?? I was that guy. Having never read an anthropology book before, someone recommended me Guns, Germs & Steel - which I read and swallowed whole, it almost immediately became \u201cthe best book I\u2019ve ever read\u201d. For quite a few years I recommended it to everyone I could find.  Then I happened upon r/askanthropology. Humbled by the ever-patient anthropologists gently, and repeatedly, explaining to  other Jared Diamond devotees that the book I loved was essentially not much better than a conspiracy theory, I resolved to be a bit more careful about what I believed, and to improve my understanding of anthropology through other books.  That process has only just begun, with Charles Mann\u2019s 1491, which I loved (and seems to be much better regarded by proper anthropologists than GGAS \u2026 please don\u2019t burst my bubble a second time r/askanthropology). Still a long way to go.  However, I would like to know exactly how inaccurate GGAS still is, presumably there must be aspects of it that I can still believe. I accept the broad, overarching theory is just too neat and simplistic to explain a complex world, and built on inaccurate assumptions. But a lot of what first captivated me in the book was the build up, more than the conclusion itself, the ruminations on agriculture and technology and why they spread faster in one part of the world than another. Lots of the little details I used to repeat to people as fascinating little factoids, like the idea that Europe\u2019s long history of herd animals meant our diseases were worse than those in the Americas.  What I would like to know, dear anthropologists, if you have the time and patience to humour me, is this - what of Diamond\u2019s evidence base is reliable and broadly accepted, and in what areas does it fall flat? Which interesting factoids can I continue to repeat without further contributing to the public miseducation about anthropology?\n\nAssistant:": {

We are doing no such thing. We are saying that the kinds of environmental arguments Diamond uses are a problematic way of addressing racism.\" (bold and italics added for emphasis)  I'm a cultural anthropology PhD student, but I think Diamond is worth considering as the consequences of how we summarize and explain things to general audiences. It's been a long time since I've read Diamond years ago as an undergrad, but the jist that still sits with me is that *why yes, environments do affect the way people and societies in them develop.*   However, I think that it leaves a lot of agency (and culpability!) out of the hands of people themselves.   For instance, Diamond's coda on Japan argues that agriculture didn't \"appear\" until rice crops reached a critical mass of development where they were adapted to the colder, drier climate of the Korean peninsula. That made sense to me as an undergraduate and I even wrote a paper on it. But in my own seminar work as a PhD student, it became apparent that the answer is much more complex - and while environment is a factor, Diamond got some of the details backward and forgot to consider peoples' agency.  *(It wasn't the crops needing to be adapted, but rather local environmental fluctuations and political/civil unrest that was happening around the same time that encouraged people to move and find new places like the more hospital parts of south Japan right across the Tsushima Strait).*  And from a sort of broad, superficial appearance of things (breadth over depth) it makes generalizations that \"look okay.\" But the problem with that is we can't assume that general audiences carry the same big mental asterisk that comes with these generalized assumptions.  So my suggestion would be to approach any of these popular history/social science books the same way we might think about how a topic is taught in 3rd grade, 6th grade, and 12th grade, and college. Diamond's intent to broadly interweave a lot of information and cover a lot of ground is admirable, but the problem is that when you write to a popular audience you can't or forget to qualify your generalizations.   The problem with something like Diamond is that unlike Bill Nye or Mr. Wizard, Diamond isn't just simplifying scientific principles that sound like \"technobabble\" to people. He's minimizing complex socio-cultural actions and their consequences as circumstances of environmental causes. And that erases human agency, colonialism, imperialism, etc.   Don't rely on popular books to be authoritative. Use them as a starting point... Diamond doesn't have a long list of citations, but Wikipedia does. :)",
            " I've heard a lot of similar criticism of Guns Germs and Steel on this sub and I think what the guy said in essence is Jared Diamond isn't qualified in any way as an anthropologist to write such a text. His actual background is in geography and from what I understand this seeps into the work because of the overemphasis he puts on geographical or environmental factors into colonization in GGAS. It's oversimplifying a very, very dynamic scholarly conversation. My two cents would be that I'm sure there are certain parts of what he writes that are still factually true, but this all-encompassing critique makes it such that the problem with the text isn't the bug, it's the feature. The sheer perspective of Diamond is flawed and how he writes is informed by a very strong bias and is unqualified to adequately and holistically discuss such complex subject matter.   I also read him early on in my discovery of anthropology and I think his oversimplifying of such topics can be really comforting. There's a reason why his book is so widespread in undergraduate courses. He's a compelling writer with a great narrative through line and shares a different historical perspective. Again, I'm sure there are a lot of parts of the work that you should still ponder on, especially because the book seemed to have a profound impact on you in coming to this field, but I would say to view it as a great first step venturing into an exciting field with a multitude of highly compelling and academically sound writings by other academics who you can now expose yourself to.  I definitely want to hear a more expanded discussion so I'll keep an eye on this post hoping more folks from this community engage with it, but I guess ."

It's been a long time since I've read Diamond years ago as an undergrad, but the jist that still sits with me is that *why yes, environments do affect the way people and societies in them develop.*   However, I think that it leaves a lot of agency (and culpability!) out of the hands of people themselves.   For instance, Diamond's coda on Japan argues that agriculture didn't \"appear\" until rice crops reached a critical mass of development where they were adapted to the colder, drier climate of the Korean peninsula. That made sense to me as an undergraduate and I even wrote a paper on it. But in my own seminar work as a PhD student, it became apparent that the answer is much more complex - and while environment is a factor, Diamond got some of the details backward and forgot to consider peoples' agency.  *(It wasn't the crops needing to be adapted, but rather local environmental fluctuations and political/civil unrest that was happening around the same time that encouraged people to move and find new places like the more hospital parts of south Japan right across the Tsushima Strait).*  And from a sort of broad, superficial appearance of things (breadth over depth) it makes generalizations that \"look okay.\" But the problem with that is we can't assume that general audiences carry the same big mental asterisk that comes with these generalized assumptions.  So my suggestion would be to approach any of these popular history/social science books the same way we might think about how a topic is taught in 3rd grade, 6th grade, and 12th grade, and college. Diamond's intent to broadly interweave a lot of information and cover a lot of ground is admirable, but the problem is that when you write to a popular audience you can't or forget to qualify your generalizations.   The problem with something like Diamond is that unlike Bill Nye or Mr. Wizard, Diamond isn't just simplifying scientific principles that sound like \"technobabble\" to people. He's minimizing complex socio-cultural actions and their consequences as circumstances of environmental causes. And that erases human agency, colonialism, imperialism, etc.   Don't rely on popular books to be authoritative. Use them as a starting point... Diamond doesn't have a long list of citations, but Wikipedia does. :)",
        "rejected_target": " I've heard a lot of similar criticism of Guns Germs and Steel on this sub and I think what the guy said in essence is Jared Diamond isn't qualified in any way as an anthropologist to write such a text. His actual background is in geography and from what I understand this seeps into the work because of the overemphasis he puts on geographical or environmental factors into colonization in GGAS. It's oversimplifying a very, very dynamic scholarly conversation. My two cents would be that I'm sure there are certain parts of what he writes that are still factually true, but this all-encompassing critique makes it such that the problem with the text isn't the bug, it's the feature. The sheer perspective of Diamond is flawed and how he writes is informed by a very strong bias and is unqualified to adequately and holistically discuss such complex subject matter.   I also read him early on in my discovery of anthropology and I think his oversimplifying of such topics can be really comforting. There's a reason why his book is so widespread in undergraduate courses. He's a compelling writer with a great narrative through line and shares a different historical perspective. Again, I'm sure there are a lot of parts of the work that you should still ponder on, especially because the book seemed to have a profound impact on you in coming to this field, but I would say to view it as a great first step venturing into an exciting field with a multitude of highly compelling and academically sound writings by other academics who you can now expose yourself to.  I definitely want to hear a more expanded discussion so I'll keep an eye on this post hoping more folks from this community engage with it, but I guess ."

This included study on the Satanic Ritual Abuse scare of the late 1980's and early 1990's, because that featured false memory syndrome and often Dissociative Identity Disorder \\( formerly known as multiple personality disorder\\), and it looked at the role of mental health care workers in that time period.

While my work on lobotomies really never comes up in my day\\-to\\-day life, it was still really rewarding to pursue during my education, and I absolutely use an anthropological lens as a practitioner, something my field encourages.  The way I got psychology to play nice with anthropology was by passing on an MS in psychology and instead choosing social work. Social work is very much grounded in boots on the ground, in the trenches work with humans and human psychology. I was able to pursue these psycho\\-anthropological interests because that's what I asked to do, and my program was happy to oblige because that explosion of universal rules is something social workers have to do on a daily basis. Social work is really a marriage of psychology and anthropology \\(in my opinion anyway\\).  In the end, whether you choose psychology vs. social work, I don't think that there is much conflict with anthropology. I think all psychologists and social workers are aware of what anthropology has to offer. And with a degree in either psychology or social work you are absolutely prepared for a career with lots of job opportunities.

        "rejected_target": " You need to define what you mean by civilization and collapse. In almost all cases of collapse, the collapse is limited to the socio-political systems in which the elite navigate. Your average person is largely unaffected from any kind of major catastrophe.   Just look at the Maya. The Classic period collapse is a misnomer at this point. Yes, Lowland centers were abandoned, but they were abandoned over the course of several centuries. And during that time other centers continued, thrived, and even prospered. Whole new cities were built or previously abandoned Preclassic or Early Classic cities were reoccupied/renewed. The biggest change you see in the archaeological record for the Maya from the Classic to the Postclassic is the loss of divine ruler ship among the elite. Instead, there are just kings (and sometimes councils) that do not have that divine and heavenly mandate backing their station."

Since the news came out about the discovery of Homo Naledi, a lot of discussion has been around their supposed burial. Having read a number of articles about it, I'm not terribly convinced this was the case. From my understanding, the only things found in this cave were the bones themselves, with no surrounding context. Who's to say they weren't placed there by more recent people?  What I'm basically asking is that, if you think this was in fact some sort of ritual burial, why do you believe this to be the case?\n\nAssistant:": {

Intentional burial is a positive claim, and you need evidence for it.   Gargett (1999) published what I think is a pretty good, albeit incomplete list of criteria that would need to be met to confirm the presence of an intentional Middle Palaeolithic burial. We have no idea if *H. naledi* is from the Middle Palaeolithic or not, but I think the criteria are still applicable.   The questions to answer include: are there new and distinct geological strata indicating burial, are there complete skeletons, are there articulated skeletons, are the skeletal elements preserved relatively equally, are the remains fragmented, what is the position of the skeletons, is there evidence of trampling or other peri/post mortem disturbance, what are the bedrock characteristics of the area, what was the depositional environment, and what other evidence of taphonomic processes is present?  It's certainly possible to argue against some of these criteria, but it's also easy to see that *H. naledi* does not satisfy a lot of them. And this list was developed for Middle Palaeolithic humans and Neanderthals, not an undated species from any time in the past few million years, for which we have no evidence of any cultural development. The proof required in this case should be more stringent, not less, and yet the only argument for intentional burial is \"why would they be there otherwise?\" It's just not good enough.

            " This is a very complex thing to answer. It is important to remember that all religion is lived religion (AKA vernacular religion.) In other words, Islam is about more than the Qur'an, hadiths, and mosque. Muslims carry their faith with them as they walk out of the mosque and then have the interpret the world around them based upon their religious teachings, ethics, personal relationships, desires, politics, economic situations, etc. Despite attempts by certain groups to recreate the time of the Prophet (or Jesus or any other charismatic leader) the faith group can never actually go back to that. Thus, the life and teachings of the prophet and/or text are always historically situated and must be interpreted for the constantly changing reality of the followers. Religion is not a thing that is static or constant. To talk about it as such is to reify it. Instead, religion is a set of ideas and beliefs that are often based upon texts and prophets/leaders but which by their nature must always adapt to be meaningful to the lives of the people that practice them.   This means that at times people will inevitably disagree about interpretations or ways to apply that faith to the world around them. You can't live the life of the prophet because that world no longer exists. So people have to choose what is still relevant or applicable. They have to interpret larger meanings or intentions of those teachings. Sometimes, practitioners might feel that certain teachings or rules really only applied to that historic context and aren't relevant anymore, while others disagree. Personal desires and politics also come into play and influence how this occurs.   Clifford Geertz's classic example was a Javanese funeral. A young man named Paidjan suddenly died, but due to the deceased\u2019s affiliations with Permai (a political and mysticism movement) the local Muslim leader refused at first to bury him according to traditional Islamic methods. In Java, bodies are usually buried quickly and with iklas, which is the lack of emotional distress, in a communal setting. However, without the option of the traditional method of Islamic burial, the friends and family of the deceased were at a loss for how to treat the dead and became greatly distraught. They were forced to throw together a funeral that lacked the symbols, consensus, and authority typically used for such an event. This is because the social and political climate of Java had changed, where members of the community no longer shared a unified religious belief, but the practical matters of issues such as funerals had not yet adjusted to the change. In sum, the disruption of Paidjan\u2019s funeral may be traced to a single source: \u201can incongruity between the cultural framework of meaning and the patterning of social interaction, an incongruity due to the persistence in an urban environment of a religious symbol system adjusted to peasant social structure\" (1973:169). This incongruity meant the ritual failed to synthesize ethos and worldview.  Geertz uses this Javanese example in an attempt to deal with what happens when culture is not just reinforced in a stagnant manner. He introduces the concept of intellectual systematizers which are individuals who attempt to forge new and more self-conscious systems of cultural meanings in the face of changed social realities. Yet, if alterations to rituals make it a failure, how do intellectual systematizers create new and still successful rites? It is worth asking whether there is ever a ritual where every individual\u2019s personal system of symbols map perfectly onto the collective expression. Almost all rituals contain the possibility for variations that do not disqualify the rite from social acceptance. Would the funeral have been a disaster if the imam had agreed to hold the funeral but added a warning about the political and religious dangers of Permai? Or, if the imam had held the funeral in the traditional Javanese Muslim fashion, would Permai attendees who do not hold Muslim beliefs have ruined the funeral even if they participated appropriately? Most cultures provide a range of acceptable responses to a situation. I suggest that while some cultural shifts do occur through self-conscious action, many also change slowly over time through small adjustments that are not seen as important enough to alter a ritual\u2019s efficacy.   In sum, all religions have to adapt and change in order to remain relevant to the lives of the people who practice them. But those shifts require downplaying certain aspects, emphasizing others, and creating new ones. Over time this means that not only will the religion change from how it was initially practiced but divisions may occur."

    "\n\nHuman: To PhD or PTSD? That\u2019s the concern On the Fence and no idea which way to go.  I\u2019m truly on the fence about if I want to go back to school. A little background, last year I completed my MA in Bio. Anthropology at a university in the Midwest. I graduated Magna Cum Laude and for all intensive purposes looked great on paper. However, my graduate experience has left me with some PTSD. Like most people now I had to work through school to support myself. I worked at the lab I was studying in as a graduate assistant and at a separate place of employment. When I got into the program I was told of the opportunities I would get and do because I had experience. (I was an undergrad at the same university.)   None of what I was sold was ever provided. I was in the lab more often than not, on top of honor society duties, homework and my other job, and when certain things came up, I was denied. Why? The answers went three ways:  1. I was too busy with my other job and no one knew my schedule. Which was a lie because it was a set schedule and every other graduate student in my department knew where I would be to the near minute of the day.  2. I wasn\u2019t as \u201cdedicated\u201d as I should be. Because I would go home for one week of the summer (when nothing was going on or planned as my advisor would also be doing other things.) and for two weeks during the winter holiday (lab was shut down and we literally couldn\u2019t enter the building.)  3. I was unfocused. My advisor made me change my thesis topic not once, not twice but 6 times. This was AFTER, he had approved it, seen my notes and multiple sources as well as the draft for my proposals. All of which he had given the green light until the last minute when I was told it wouldn\u2019t work. Only to have a friend of mine actually do a project based off what I had wanted to do for my thesis after telling me I couldn\u2019t.   This was a constant. I was at the lab more than my own home. I was often told my thoughts were biased based on my ethnic background (Hispanic/white and Apache.) and that I was smart for someone of my background. That they couldn\u2019t believe I passed my comprehensive exams. This all continued to when I was supposed to go collect the necessary data for my thesis. My advisor wouldn\u2019t let me contact the labs, and on several occasions became flat out offended that I would try. Saying it was his job to do so not mine. When telling other grad students this they were confused as they had contacted them and it was all right. I tried and when the lab contacted him to set up a date in which I could go, he told them to cancel my request. So I did as he wanted and  let him. When spring of 2020 came around I was in his office every week asking if he had heard. He told me he had been contacting these labs and no one would return his emails. (Looking back it is bogus but I was extremely tired and worn down, trying to not rock the boat.) Then the week the world shut down in March I was told that a lab had finally answered. I wouldn\u2019t be able to collect data because of the pandemic. I was taken off my thesis track and placed onto a project. That same week I received 10 rejections from PhD programs due to my recommendation letters (which I had told had been sent) never being received. I was devastated as I had always wanted to get my PhD. I love the field and research but that along with everything else in the last two years really took a toll on me. I graduated snd am now in the workforce. Ironically, as my advisor had wanted it because to quote, \u201cYou would be able to have a family and marriage, if you only had a Masters, and did not continue on to a PhD.\u201d.  So, here I am almost a year out from grad school. I look back now and I see the toll it took on me, mentally, emotionally and physically. None of which were good. I did have good experiences in grad school, but if I\u2019m honest I had more in the bad category. Grad school is supposed to be hard, but it shouldn\u2019t be damaging. Which is how I have felt since leaving along with my peers who did with me as well. A part of me still wants my PhD as it was a dream but I don\u2019t know if I can throw myself back into that toxicity. Any thoughts?\n\nAssistant:": {

If you choose to apply again, obviously you need to resolve that problem. Not sure what advice you are really seeking here but it seems like there\u2019s a structural impediment regardless of what you want to do with your life.   As for the notion that academia is toxic, bad for mental health or indeed traumatizing, that obviously varies from person to person and situation to situation. As for grad school being \u201cdamaging\u201d, it sometimes is, unfortunately. Despite everyone being aware of the problems of the academic system, it nevertheless persists in its present state for a variety of reasons.   You don\u2019t express why you want to get a PhD so all I\u2019ll say is that if you are going to dedicate yourself to a life of the mind, a PhD from a good school will help you sharpen your thinking, become socialized in a research community, and have the time to conduct your own research. Nothing is guaranteed about it being pleasant or leading to a job.",
        "rejected_target": " I'm an undergraduate rn and I have always had the dream of going to grad school. After dealing with an entire yr of online school my mental health has completely declined. I had a hard time thinking about if I wanted to continue with my dream of getting a masters degree, it caused me alot of sleeplessnights and ALOT of crying. I ultimately decided that my mental health was more important and ultimately I don't know what I want to do with my life, so I'd like to experience the real world before making a decision.   I think that this all is something you really have to think about for yourself. Are you strong enough to get through a PhD program if it turns out to be as horrible as your master program was? Are you comfortable risking your mental health? Is it worth it career wise?"

    "\n\nHuman: Why did my kid\u2019s \u201ccloud bread\u201d smell so bad? So, I don\u2019t know if you follow the youths, but there is this recipe going around social media for something called \u201ccloud bread\u201d which is like a really pared-down angel food cake you bake on a sheet pan.  Recipe below\u2014I flaired this cake not bread because IMO that\u2019s what it is, despite the name.  My daughter made it last night and while it generally resembled angel food cake in taste and texture, both the smell and a little of the taste were very sulfur-y (or, as my children said, \u201csmells like egg farts!\u201d)  I\u2019ve never had this problem with actual angel food cake.  Does anyone know why this happened?  Does the flour or other angel food cake ingredients somehow help keep the egg whites from having a sulfur smell?  Could our eggs have just been off?  They seemed normal before baking.  She was proud of herself for making it, but we\u2019d all be happier if I could give her a tip that would help it smell better next time.  Thanks!    3 egg whites  30 grams white sugar   10 grams corn starch\n\nAssistant:": {

Sometimes you can use combination of ghee and fresh butter to apply your own flavor. The fresh butter brings the moisture and the key brings the flavor  You could also make some peanut butter and jelly sugar cookies which the butter would compliment.  You could flavor the butter with things like garlic and rosemary and use that to dip your pizza crust in. Homemade pizza crust. Detroit style pizza wood benefit most from clarified butter.

    "\n\nHuman: Storing cookies I\u2019ve never done a full day christmas cookie bake before. This year I really want to- I\u2019ve been seeing sooo many amazing looking variety cookie boxes for gifts. Do most people bake the day before they\u2019ll be giving them away? How do you store everything if all the cookies are so different. I was watching YouTube videos too. Some people include chocolate covered bananas or cookies with a cream cheese frosting/glaze among other temp sensitive kinds. These things should probably be kept cold but sugar cookies and chocolate chip stay on the counter. How to go about baking and storing different types?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " So to be quite honest, I cannot stand using a water bath. There is nothing worse than wrapping your pan in foil 100 times. Here are some techniques that work for me:  1. When using a stand mixer for your ingredients, always mix on LOW. Mixing on low will help prevent your batter from retaining air, making it less likely to crack. I usually use the \"stir\" option on my kitchen aid and never go higher than a 3. Many recipes will say to scrape down the bowl between each addition of ingredients and I cannot stress enough how important that is! Making sure everything is uniform is key to a smooth, flawless cheesecake. 2. After I pour the cheesecake into the springform pan, I hit it on the counter a few times to release any possible air bubbles that may be in the batter. 3. Screw the water bath - I use a roasting pan. I position the two racks in my oven to a middle position and a low position. Thee cheesecake goes on the middle rack, and on the lower rack goes a large roasting pan which I fill 1/2 way to 3/4 of the way with boiling water which I pour into the roasting pan when I put my cheesecake in. This creates a nice steamy environment for the cheesecake without having to wrestle with sheets upon sheets of foil just to end up with a soggy crust from a water bath. 4. DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DURING BAKING! I avoid doing this at all costs as the temperature change can cause cracking. Some people recommend rotating half way through baking but I avoid doing this and have never had any problems with cracking. 5. When your cheesecake is done baking, turn off the oven and leave it alone for 30 minutes. I press the \"off\" button and leave my cheesecake in the oven with the door closed for 30 minutes to start the cooling process. After the 30 minutes is up, crack the oven door and lodge a wooden spoon between the door and the oven so there is slight air flow for further slow cooling. Do this for another 30 minutes. After that 30 minutes is up, you should be good to go. Let your cheesecake sit on the counter for another 30 minutes before placing it in the fridge to cool completely.

(I am, but don't assume guests are; don't let kids or other at-risk folks eat raw egg yolk.)  If you are careful, an immersion blender on 2-3 second pulses until -just barely- back together works wonders while it's slightly warm. This is my go-to method for fixing most custards and curds with slight splits. You do have to be careful, going too long with an immersion blender will actually irreparably split it. With a small amount of curd, probably 2-3 seconds total is enough.",

    "\n\nHuman: Why aren't compound butter pie crusts a thing? I've recently started stepping into baking my own pie doughs and doing some research yields some really smart useful tips - ie the test kitchen technique of only partial flour then the rest or using vodka/vinegar and the differences between lard or butter - all really dope.   But I've yet to see a lot or even much of anything on flavored doughs - at first I thought maybe some herbs in the flower to punch up some savory pies but then flavoring the butter makes more sense but honestly nothing. It feels so obvious that my internal flags are rising to ask, if it's so obvious but not commonly done, why?   If it just a flavor thing, like, the crust is the base and if your pie is bland then the filling should be the focus not the crust? That one I get but still, why isn't flavored butter used in more recipes when it comes to pastry? Is there a legit technical reason not to?  Hell, I know there's some convo on ghee crusts or shortening butter combos but as someone stepping into pastrys I'm just really curious?  Any discussion, advice or knowledge would be appreciated - I'm just a home cook who gets too obsessive with things and I want to learn\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Circle in my Cake?? Hazelnut Flour the Culprit? I'm a newb Hello all, so I recently just started baking, and have been having a lot of fun trying out different cakes. I've been doing GF, SF (using Swerve), and dairy free cakes, and have been having an extremely unexpected amount of success in making cakes with really good texture and taste.  But then in my chocolate hazelnut cake, both times I've made it, this has happened:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o1Zdc2O2TNHIAerhtwc-MrezMdCLEB-n/view?usp=drivesdk  I'm using this recipe, which I've had complete success with about 4 or 5 times before. I suspect it has something to do with replacing some of my flour with home-ground hazelnut flour (blended in a food processor), because that is really the only difference I could think of. I've been replacing about 25% of my normal flour with the hazelnut flour.  Wish I had a photo of the cross-section too, but it really isn't sunken at all, and only very slightly denser in that darker central circle.  Anyone know what's going on with this? Thank you!\n\nAssistant:": {

Also, if you guys have any other recommendations on what to get in relations to equipment or decorating supplies, I would really appreciate it!   Thank you!\n\nAssistant:": {

            " I have some Fat Daddio cake pans and really like them. I've found a lot of them at Homegoods (in the TJMaxx/Marshall's family of stores). Better than Wilton pans. I recommend going to Sugar Geek Show's website and looking up her recipe for Cake Goop, her homemade pan release. It works super well.  An offset spatula and a flat cake scraper will be helpful too. I have been using a 6\" bench scraper. I got a Wilton cake scraper but it has a plastic handle in the middle that kept leaving dents in my cake so I'm not a big fan.   For cake decorating start simple. Some nice quality disposable piping bags (the ones from someplace like Michael's are fine, just not a super flimsy one that will burst its seams) and a 1M piping tip are good to start with! Great for cakes or cupcakes.",
            " Ahem   1. Weighing scale- you wanna start baking? Be pro by using weights. Id invest on a high capacity .0 precision reading scale.  2. Round Cake pan- start small with an 6inch round cake pan 3. Square pan- get a big one, rectangle or square. 8inch atleast. Good for cinnamon rolls, brownies, bars, sponges, dinner rolls. Very versatile.  4. Flat sheet trays- cookies, macarons, etc. handy to have extra on hand for big batches of bakes  5. Oven thermometer- just for better oven temp reading. 6. Silicon spatula- get small, medium, and large. Great for cooking stuff like compote, caramel, creme anglaise, pastry cream. The way silicon spatula bends allows better scrapping to prevent burns on the bottom of pan. Not all spatula are made equal, good ones usually has burgandy red handle and white scraper tip. 7. Rolling pins- i prefer just the slab of wood, ive never liked metals with mechanical handles that rotates on its own as they break easily. 8. Hand mixer- if you cant afford a stand mixer, atleast get a hand mixer. Good for heavy duty mixing like meringue, buttercream, frosting, foams. 9. Palette knife aka metal spatula- good for spreading batters, leveling frosting, decorating, etc.  10. Whisk- get a medium and large ones, get ones with thick flexible wires and very wide balloon shapes as that whips and mixes better.  11. Basic piping tips- small round (2mm) for lettering, a medium round, large round, medium star, and large star. Those are the essentials for beginner decorating.  12. Fine mesh strainer or Tamis- for sifting and straining.",
            " Digital. Scale. Is so important. Get one. I love Nordicware round pans, I also have many other pans by them. The size of the pan depends on what recipes you usually use, and the purpose of your baking. I have two 9inch pans, two 8inch pans, a 9x13, a 9x9, an 8x8, 2 half cookie sheets, 3 quarter cookie sheets, a bundt pan, cupcake pan, and two loaf pans. Each has a purpose to me. Parchment paper is important too.   An offset spatula is a nice tool, but a spatula is essential.",

    "\n\nHuman: Can I use self-raising flour to make a sourdough starter? I am in lockdown like most of us, and was looking for something to do with what I had at home since I only have limited chances to go to the store. I had some self-raising flour in the cupboard and used 300g of it to start a sourdough starter as per a website's instructions, but I later realised that they specified \"unbleached white flour\". My research online has not found a conclusive statement as to whether or not this will work with self-raising white flour. It's been three days and I have seen one or two bubbles but not really much activity. Should I just use this dough to make something else and get normal flour for a starter?  Thanks!\n\nAssistant:": {

I've always been pretty adament that I need to follow a recipe and unless things are very rare or expensive, I'll always try to hunt down every ingredient as listed without subsitutions, but at the same time I'm happy to freestyle a little based on my knowledge of flavors: typically adding things like honey, vanilla, or coffee to enhance the pre-existing ingredients.

Once you have that down you can start practicing your techniques. Start with trying things you've not baked before.

    "\n\nHuman: Need Help Keeping My Cookie Crown The Context: My work has a potluck style meal that sort of combines celebrating Thanksgiving and Christmas. I usually bring my cranberry and white chocolate oatmeal cookies. They have gained a bit of a reputation and I'm worried that my usual efforts might not live up to the hype. I'm trying to figure out how to take my already good cookies to the next level.  The main flavors: craisin white chocolate chip vanilla extract brown sugar  The needed help: I would like to add another complementary layer of flavor with the addition of spices. My \"Flavor Bible\" (all hail our lords and saviors, Page and Dornenburg) say that cinnamon, cloves, ginger, honey, or even orange zest are possibilities. I know using all these would be overkill. So I need help choosing which and how much to add.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Browning Butter I have been trying to nail down BA's best chocolate chip recipe (LINK).  The recipe calls for browning the butter, 1 ^(1/2)  Sticks (^(3/4) Cup)  The first time I made it I browned enough butter to have ^(3/4) cup of melted brown butter, which resulted in overly greasy buttery cookies. I did a little googling and found that browned butter should be about ^(3/4) of the original butter since the water has evaporated. So from this I assumed that browning 1 ^(1/2)  Sticks (^(3/4) Cup) butter should result in ^(1/2) cup of browned butter for the final recipe.   Except when I went to brown my butter, I ended up with roughly the same measurement I started out with. I didn't want to end up having the same problem as before so I used about half a cup of the browned butter and the cookies tasted better than the first attempt.   My question is how much butter am I supposed to be using for the recipe after browning, is it the full ^(3/4) of a cup - or the reduced amount of ^(1/2) cup?   And second, why didn't my butter reduce in volume? Did i not cook it long enough for the water to evaporate - even though it had developed a nice amber colour and nutty aroma? I was scared of burning so I assumed it was done, should I have let it cook some more?   &#x200B;  Thanks!\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Sticky Toffee Pudding... differences in 3 recipes I have been wanting to attempt making a sticky toffee pudding for a while and have found 3 seemingly good recipes, but each one is fairly different from the other.  This one uses treacle and muscovado sugar.  These items just do not exist in my local shops, but I have a black strap molasses and brown sugar (light and dark).  Are these suitable to substitute in a 1:1 ratio with the original recipe?  This also does not have chopped dates in it, but the others do.  Having never made or eaten this before, how much would it matter having the dates or not?  This one looks very basic and simple to make.  It uses granulated (white) sugar in the sponge instead of a more flavorful brown sugar (or muscovado/treacle), so how much of a difference would that make and would it taste like an authentic dish or not?  This one has the same granulated sugar, but uses golden syrup (or molasses) in the sauce and the previous one does not.  The rest of the recipe is similar to the previous, just in smaller portions for a smaller bake, which would be better for me since I'm the only one eating it anyways.  I know this is typically a European (UK/English?) kind of dish and having never tasted it I don't just don't know how these substitutions or variations will effect the final dish.

    "\n\nHuman: What is the car culture like in your country? I'm interested as to the car cultures you guys have in your home countries/the countries you live in now. In Australia people are fairly judgemental, and Hondas are basically taboo. Down south in Canberra, camber is a massive thing, and almost every car from there that's been extensively modified has at least some camber. In my experiences in Caberra, Queensland and NSW, Evos, WRX STI's, Supras, Silvias and Skylines are the most common JDM cars we have. Cars like 300zx's, S2000's, Alteza's, and general muscle cars are a rarity at car meets. Holdens are probably the most common general cars here, and there's always at least 1 at every meet.   Also everything here is fucking expensive.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " New Zealand car culture is pretty great. We have all types of cars over here, American, European, British, Australian, Chinese, Japanese, basically everything.   Mostly everyone has a respect for others cars and tastes, as there's a wide variety of both. There's plenty of people that own V8 Holdens and Fords or fast Euros, but these people generally aren't the car enthusiast type, they just want something fast that they can fit their family in. The majority of car people here are either into classics, like Impala, Mustang, XA Falcon, or your normal Japanese tuner car like WRX, Evo, or Skyline.   As far as I know you can't really live anywhere in NZ that isn't within about a 2hr drive of a racetrack so the general culture here is more one of function over form. Also helps that we have what's called a Warrant of Fitness, which is a safety check every 6 or 12 months depending on the age of the car, so you can't get away with stupid ass mods like crazy camber or dodgy lowering.

I mean we have big meets like the GTI meet at the W\u00f6rthersee, but car's are very expensive here due to taxes, insurance is through the roof because you have to pay monthly engine taxes based on your cars power.  Also, modded cars are rarer than unicorns, becaude everything has to be approved by the state which is expensive as fuck, complicated and takes forever.   Just to give you an idea, registering a car (a job which takes 5 minutes) costs \u20ac180.   A WRX costs around \u20ac15-20k more here than it does in Germany, I think."

    "\n\nHuman: Is an engine swap possible without any car experience, and what cars/engines are easiest? Hey guys (folks)! I really want to buy a cheap rwd car sometime in the future and do an engine swap, maybe something like a V8 Miata. I've watched some engine swap videos and it looks complicated, but is it something I would be able to do without any previous experience, even if it takes awhile?  Also, are there any specific cars and engine combinations that you enjoy that are fairly easy, preferably with kits and lots of resources available online?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Bought a used car. How do I get cigarette stink out of it?  Hi everyone! I just bought my first used car, it was from a family member and I didn't have to pay for the car itself, just the repairs, so it was too good a deal to pass up. Problem is, my family member's boyfriend smoked constantly in the car and did so for years. There was ash all under the driver and passenger seat like he just knocked the ash off over the center console but somehow always missed. Quite frankly the whole thing was gross. The key fob was practically yellow and I spent a good half hour scrubbing it.  I febreezed inside the car a few days ago and got a clip-on air freshener for the vent, and yesterday I spent 5 hours with the doors all open vacuuming as much up as I could, then sprinkled baking soda all over the upholstery and floors, and left two containers of used coffee grounds open in the car (I've heard coffee absorbs smell?). When I locked it up yesterday it smelled alright, still lingered a little but I thought I'd gotten the worst of it. Today I went out to check and reeked like I hadn't done anything to it in the first place. What the hell do I do? I'll start driving it as my primary vehicle in a month and I don't know how to get the stink out! I'm not a smoker, I don't like sitting in cars that smell like cigarettes, I certainly don't want to subject any friends to a cigarette-y car, and I *definitely* don't want the smell clinging to my clothes. Is my only option to pay for expensive detailing? Help!\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: New to driving manual. Stop lights are my nightmare. Any tips? I\u2019ve been driving for around 4 years now here in the US where most cars are automatic. For the last 2 weeks I\u2019ve been learning manual as my new car is a manual and the most discouraging thing I face are stop lights.   When I come to a stop sign I feel no pressure as if there\u2019s a clock against me and I start the car smoothing and perfectly fine.  However when ever I come to a stop light, for some reason I\u2019m always at the front of the line and then there\u2019s like 6 cars behind me. Ofc I don\u2019t wanna have the clutch held in the whole time so the cars in neutral. But whenever the light turns green I quickly put the car in gear and try to go but then I stall out. After I stall I immediately get the car going the next time and I\u2019m off to the races.   Tho it\u2019s super discouraging feeling like I\u2019m racing against the clock every time I wait for a car to turn green. And since everyone in an automatic the people next to me at the light start so stinking fast cuz all the gotta do is hit the gas.   Anyone have any tips to where I can still practice driving but not feel like an idiot that can\u2019t go out on the main roads?   Maybe just going out at like 11pm and driving around while there are less cars on the road?   tl;dr: Whenever I\u2019m at a stoplight I\u2019m always the first in line. I feel like I\u2019m against the clock when the light turns green and I end up stalling the car.

    "\n\nHuman: 2008 Honda Pilot timing belt failure while on highway. Engine is most likely shot. What are the available options? My friend was making his 3 hour drive back home yesterday, having borrowed his family's 2008 Honda Pilot, doing about 90 down the highway when the car basically catastrophically fails, accelerator immediately stops functioning, all the warning lights come on, and he pulls over immediately. He gets it towed somewhere and the guy says the timing belt snapped. (Entirely owner error: it's his mom's car and she never got the belt replaced as per routine maintenance guidelines). Like I said, it's a 2008, and I think he said it was 114k miles.   From everything I've read, it sounds like it's almost certain the engine is shot (interference engine and all that). Currently the car is still at that shop. His family knows nothing about cars and is just trying to weigh their options right now.  From my understanding, they can either buy a replacement engine and pay to have it put in (from what I saw online, probably $2-4k for an engine, plus labor). Or they can just sell it. This is where I'm not really sure what the options are. Obviously it can't be sold as a drive-able car. What kind of value would it have as just parts? I can't imagine very much.   Any knowledge, information, advice, recommendations etc is appreciated. It seems like it's gonna be shitty no matter what - but hey, that's why you keep up with routine maintenance. If there's another option that I'm missing, please let me know. Otherwise, it's just a matter of weighing the pros and cons of the two available and deciding which to do.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Does it really matter what brand of tires I buy? Hi there.  So a bit embarrassed, but in the past when I've needed new tires, I've maybe gotten a couple quotes from a couple tire shops, but only based on whatever I told them my car make/model/year was and what they had in stock.  I feel like maybe I should be a little more informed about this process.  I live in a pretty mild climate, but do a lot of freeway driving.  Occasionally drive up to the snow and mountains about 1X or 2X a year (but I also have cables).  Does it really matter what brand I buy as long as the tire's the correct size?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Should I keep my prius? I bought a 2018 Toyota Prius about 2 months ago. I work for Grubhub so it seems like a decent car for the job. It's just so boring and weird to drive. This is my first CVT. Diesel trucks are always racing me and blowing smoke everywhere. I'm not racing them. I don't care. I am making lots of money with Grubhub. Not bragging, just saying. I know I can afford a much more fun car than the prius. Maybe I don't know how good I have it. I do like the idea of a manual sedan or hatchback with a 4 cylinder or 6 that feels pretty sporty. Or just convince me to keep the prius. What do you guys think? Thanks.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Should I give this guy a refund? I sold this guy my little 05 dodge stratus. When he came to look at it we had to jump start it. The car has been sitting for a couple of months so I didn't think anything of it. It started up and he took it for a drive and everything was good. He said he wanted to buy it and would come back Tuesday.  When he got here the car was dead again. I told him I thought that might mean the battery or the alternator needed fixed but I was only guessing. I price checked both parts with my mechanic down the road and subtracted that from the overall amount that he paid me. He said he absolutely wanted it anyway and I signed over the title to him and provided him with a full inspection of the car that I had done a couple months back (it hadn't been driven since). I offered to tow him to the mechanic and have the battery inspected before we signed the title but he insisted that he wanted it. After I signed it to him he ignores my advice and goes and buys a battery and replaces the battery with his friend. Car doesn't start. He asks me if I would tow it to his house for him to work on it and I agreed and paid 60 bucks for his tow. His friend replaces the alternator and the car still doesn't start.  Now he is asking me to take the car back. I am feeling very frustrated because I already lowered the cost by a lot so he could pay for repairs and he ignored my advice completely and cost me even more money. I would have to get a new title and tow it back here as well. Should I refund this guy? Is it possible that the issue is small since the battery, alternator and starter are all new?  Any advice is appreciated.\n\nAssistant:": {

My latest list of heartbreaks include (but are not limited to) scones, a chocolate babka loaf and an Irish soda bread - all of which had to stay in the oven for much longer than the recipe said, and even when they eventually seemed ready, they were very moist and doughy in the middle (my babka loaf even collapsed when I cut it).   I know that some Dutch baking products are different to what I\u2019ve been using at home - baking powder is less strong here, and it\u2019s hard to find a good bread flour. But this seems more like an oven temperature issue to me? I bought a cheap oven thermometer which says the oven is 15-20 degrees cooler than it should be, but given that it\u2019s a cheap thermometer and the sugar test I ran said my oven temp was accurate (at least at 375 F), I\u2019m at a loss at what to do.   Do you have any suggestions about a possible culprit? Could my oven be too cool? Or too hot? Would both too-cool and too-hot ovens lead to under-baked insides? Any advice on either diagnosing the problem or solving it would be appreciated!\n\nAssistant:": {

Veganism is uncommon here but it may be on the steady rise. I've been learning how to make vegan paella, sushi, curry, stews, soups, mediterranean, breads, wraps and a whole host of inventions along the way. I've been cooking for myself from scratch for the past 5 years basically every day.  There is a school called  Vegan Gastronomy Culinary Academy here in Spain, and there is a 5 day intensive course in person to get an \"International Vegan Chef\" certification for  \u20ac750, or an online version that is  \u20ac250. Would it be useful for learning terminology/techniques and having a certification to help me along this path? My dream is to one day own and operate a countryside Inn, but be around the kitchen for the most part. To get me there, I don't mind racking up experience in restaurants or doing home catering.\n\nAssistant:": {

I toast my own in the toaster oven - say, pumpkin seeds tossed in a little EVOO with spices (cajun? cumin/cayenne?) - which adds an extra short step of work, but is so worth it. I keep a few jars' worth at all times. * Goat cheese. I live near a couple bomb farmers markets and can get great cheese there, but even plain from store is fantastic. Adds a little unctuousness that makes a salad a \"meal.\" * Roast veggies. Roast one - beets! broccoli! green beans! - or all of them. Chop and add, or base an entire salad around chopped/roasted veggies. Plus: they stay strong when dressed/refrigerated for a day or two.  * Stay seasonal. You'll get the best flavor. Right now squashes and root veggies are at their best, so a roasted butternut salad with goat cheese and quinoa and herbs sounds terrific. Again, easy to prep in advance.  * Don't dress salads in advance, as many here recommend and provide great recipes. Sometimes it's great with hardier veggies and grains, but lettuce really can't hack it.   ...go forth and make great salads!",

I hate soggy salads, but I also hate having to clean out tiny tupperwares or using tons of little plastic baggies for holding dressing. What I do instead is mix the beans and salad dressing together and put them in the bottom of my container (I use a 4 cup Pyrex bowl with a glass lid), then cram lettuce on top and push out as much air as possible when closing the lid to keep the dressing from moving around too much. When it's lunch time, I just let some air in, re-close the lid, and shake it up. Lazy person salad express. I also make my own dressing and keep it in old jam jars. I either use a basic sherry vinegar/dijon vinaigrette or take a time machine back to the 70s and make a greek yogurt goddess dressing with extra garlic.   I also love wedge salads. My favorite is iceberg, blue cheese dressing, chopped dried dates, and crunched up smoked almonds. You could use another lettuce besides iceberg, but the crunchy tastelessness is part of the recipe. It just wouldn't be the same without iceberg lettuce."
        ],
        "sft_target": " I eat a salad everyday for lunch due to my avoidance issues with the microwave at work. Some things I've learned:  *use kale/chard instead of lettuce to avoid wilty greens when dressing the night before.  *think colors: broccoli, peppers, carrots, radishes, turnips, tomatoes, cucumbers, mushrooms, zucchini, avocado, apples, raisins etc..you get the idea, all things that make your salad taste better.  *Add meat! Roast a chicken, buy some canned Tuna or sardines, protein makes a salad go from a light snack to hearty lunch.   *Oil + vinegar + ? = amazingly simple dressing.  (? can be mustard, garlic, ginger, lemon)  *Ground flax seeds, walnuts or sunflower seeds offer a nice boost to salad texture.   *invest in one or two leak proof tupperware containers that lock, so oil doesn't empty all over your bag  But yeah, salads are bomb, when made well, they'll make everyone envious.",
        "rejected_target": " As far as keeping things fresh and crisp, a salad spinner can be helpful. Refresh your greens with a cold water wash, spin them dry and let them sit in the fridge for 20 minutes or so. Perks them up and helps with that nice crisp texture."

In my search for perfect hummus I learned a lot of things, but I never understood what causes hummus to turn whiter when all ingredients are combined and **how can I maximize this effect**. Does anyone know more about this reaction?   Is it the acid from the lemon / citric acid? Is it the cold from the ice / ice water?  I am about to test a method that combines these two potential factors: mixing water with citric acid and putting it in the freezer up until it just starts freezing, then directly adding it in the hummus preparation process.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Used to make bone broth solely with beef bones, would have a THICK layer of fat to remove once refrigerated. Started adding chicken feet. Broth has went from brown to yellow and the layer of fat that hardens is just the surface of the broth as opposed to that thick disk. What\u2019s happening here? So I\u2019m really confused and I\u2019m hoping someone can explain this to me if they know what\u2019s going on. I used to make my bone broth solely with beef bones and after refrigerating I would remove at least a 1-2 inch hardened layer of fat.   Then I started adding chicken feet.The color of the broth has turned from brown to yellow and now the layer of fat I\u2019m removing once hardened in the fridge is extremely small. Maybe just a couple centimeters thick. It just covers the top of the gelatinized broth that I can literally scrape off with a rubber spatula but I\u2019m no longer getting that large amount of fat. Why is this?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Why does it take way longer for me to cook ingredients on a pan than recipes call for? For example, I was making this tonight and the recipe calls for cooking the chicken \"until well browned, 2\u20133 minutes\". It ended up taking more like ~7~10 minutes to get the chicken browned. This was despite the chicken being (very) defrosted and sitting out on my kitchen counter for ~1 hour. To be clear, the chicken was throughly defrosted in my refrigerator before I let it sit on the counter.  Later on in that same recipe, the instructions say \"[toss] occasionally, until sauce is reduced by more than half and thickens, 2\u20133 minutes.\" Again, it ended up being more like ~7~10 minutes before the sauce was substantially reduced/thickened.   This phenomenon (cook times on a pan being way longer than the recipe claims) always happens: across many kitchens and pans (gas, electric, non-stick, aluminum, etc.). What am I doing wrong? And yes, I do set the temperature to whatever the recipe calls for (typically medium-high).   Bake times on recipes have always been accurate for me.\n\nAssistant:": {

The only medication I'm on is the birth control patch, Xulane. I have depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety.   Yesterday, I went to sleep for a \"nap\" at around 3:45 PM. I'm just now waking up at 10:50 AM. The only thing I remember from yesterday is crying for about an hour and laying down to sleep.   I'm still tired despite sleeping for so long, and I keep fading in and out of sleep, and the dreams I'm having are of me waking up, and when I actually wake up I feel really confused.   I feel very nauseous, weak, and shakey, and my head is spinning in circles. Im so dizzy and have a headache. I have this horrible feeling of dread in my gut like I'm going to die. I'm not in a good state of consciousness because I feel so confused with everything and my train of thought keeps fading out into something else every few seconds. It's very hard to write this. I can feel my heart beating super hard and fast in my throat for no reason. Every time I want to put my hand above me, it's hard and it feels like I'm holding a cinder block   Basically, I'm asking, what are possible reasons did I sleep for that long and why do I feel like this? My sleeping schedule isnt exactly perfect but it's not to the point I needed to sleep for that long. Eevry night I get around 7 to eight hours of sleep. Should I be going to the doctor?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Healthy sister died at 19 update! Hi everyone, I made a post about two weeks ago about my late 19 year old sister. I was confused about her cause of death, knowing it was cardiac arrest but what had caused it?  Her toxicology report was completely clean. They found fibrosis on the heart indicative of other heart attacks, at least half a dozen, during the autopsy - but I got a call yesterday saying that she has a genetic mutation.   I don\u2019t know much about this, and now our entire immediate family (me and my parents) must be tested. The mutated gene is PPA2, which lines up right, but the medical examiners aren\u2019t able to give a full cause of death until they test everyone in the immediate family because she has a variant they are not 100% sure about.   I\u2019ve done some research about the PPA2 gene - it seems it\u2019s a big contributor to sudden infant death, but why would it hit my sister when she was 19? The sensitivity to alcohol makes sense, but me as her sister, how much do I have to worry? I drink quite frequently (regrettably) and haven\u2019t had any chest pain, but knowing that we have a genetic mutation in the family has me utterly freaked out - does anybody know anything else about this?   Was there any way we could have caught this before she passed - did she have to take a genetic test?   My sister was 19 and healthy, seemingly. Is it common for somebody of her age to die of a mutation like this? I\u2019m finding endless studies, but no idea how common it is, I want to know as much as possible about this mutation and what it means for my life, and if there are any foundations that support research that I can donate to, or even a program to help educate young people what a heart attack truly felt like, because my sister did not!  Any help is appreciated, and I\u2019ll provide the link to the original post if needed.\n\nAssistant:": {

I\u2019m not familiar with the PPA2 mutation, but I found this article in which a few teenagers (besides infants) had cardiac arrest between 14 and 16 years old, and 4 out of 5 drank alcohol before the event. They strictly recommend avoiding alcohol: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41436-021-01296-6  As to you: I would avoid alcohol altogether until they have done definitive genetic testing on you. What is your age? If you\u2019re older than your sister the chances of having the mutation (already having had a lot of alcohol in the past) seem slim, but I would still be cautious.",
            " Hi.  This is a clinical and research interest of mine.   PPA2 is a genetic mutation associated with arythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) and mitochondrial cardiomyopathies. There is an overlap between the two.  The autopsy report you were given supports ARVD. Based on this, your sister DID NOT have multiple heart attacks. Instead, she had a genetic mutation that replaced normal cardiac myocytes with fibrotic tissue. The problem with this is that the normal pathways of conduction become skewed and predisposed her to arrhythmias. I have not seen your original post (I am running into work and wanted to give you this information ASAP). She most likely suffered from a ventricular arrhythmia causing cardiac arrest.   It is extremely important that your entire immediate family get screened for this genetic mutation. Now, even if you have the mutation, you may not have the disease. ARVD has variable penetrance, meaning you can have the mutation but NOT have the disease.  AFTER screening, IF any of your family members are positive for the gene, they need AT MINIMUM an echocardiogram, but should have a cardiac MRI to determine if the disease is present or just the gene. If disease is present, will need a defibrillator.  Again, sorry for the fast response but wanted to give you this info. I am extremely sorry for your loss and all of this stress. Please feel free to DM me with questions or for help interpreting results.",

It\u2019s also a fantastic learning opportunity for both medical professionals along with anyone interested in their condition or caregivers (parents, caretakers) seeking advice either by making a post or searching for responses to previous posts.  I am not in the medical field. I do realize this forum is named Askdocs and it is intended to get answers from doctors.  I have posted a couple of times, likely under my former ID, in response to people who need urgent advice in an area that I actually know enough about to provide my un-credentialed advice.  Normally, because both my wife and one of my sons suffers from anaphylactic allergic reactions, if I read a post from someone experiencing what sounds like it is a systemic allergic reaction, and no one has responded yet, I will post they should strongly consider taking Benadryl and going to ER.  Are posts such as this permissible on this forum? Obviously, a lot of questionable advice is strewn around on here. I understand going to the ER shouldn\u2019t be recommended as often as it is by lay posters, not only for lack of medical necessity but also to spare both the ER staff and patients with a true emergent condition the distraction.  Finally, I\u2019d like to opine quickly, as someone who reads this forum daily: I find it amazing how many people have anxiety and are posting questions driven more by anxiety than any pathology AND I find it so sad when people provide the required information and so many are really overweight. Anxiety and obesity are major epidemics in our society.  Thank you.",

I agree with letting the verified, experienced doctors and specialized RN\u2019s give medical answers. All other methods of care should be addressed in another sub entirely.

    "\n\nHuman: After traumatic events, I cannot stop vomiting Age: 27  Sex: Female  Height: 5'8\"  Weight: 119  Race: Caucasian  Duration of complaint: approx 4 years  Location (Geographic and on the body): Colorado, stomach, esophagus  Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): Being treated for cavitations, leftover root at one site (lower right); Also suspected as having Babesiosis (more testing to come); Extremely swollen left tonsil  Current medications (if any): Tumeric, Vitamin D, Ozone water, Vitamin C  Include a photo if relevant (skin condition for example): N/A  So for the past few years, following any traumatic* event (of which I will explain in more detail), I will start to vomit to the point where I cannot hold anything down: no liquids or solids.  The only way to keep hydrated is by going in to get IV fluids.  I just got back from such a treatment.  *_Note: I define a \"traumatic event\" as an event related to my health of which significant healing is required afterward_  **First traumatic event: the birth of firstborn** This was the first notable time this phenomenon came over me: I birthed at home, the labor lasting about 4 hours total.  During the first hour, I started to vomit and continued to do so during the rest of the birth.  Otherwise, there were no complications during the birth, and my baby was born healthy.  After birth, whenever I would breastfeed, it would trigger a vomit-response, of which I was not able to recover from for about a week.  I finally went into the ER and they gave me IV-fluids and ran checkups to check for leftover placenta (of which there was none).  They also gave me an anti-nausea agent (I forget what it was).  Ironically, I felt more nauseous when they gave it to me, and I threw up.  I would find out about six months later that the apartment I was living in was mold-infested.  I promptly moved out and wrote this occurrence off as being a side-effect of having my overall health compromised.  **Second traumatic event: the birth of firstborn** For my second child, I also birthed at home.  This time, I did not start to vomit until much later in the birth, but it was the same story while breastfeeding: vomiting, of which I was not able to recover from for about a week.  _Side-note: as it is not uncommon to feel nauseous while breastfeeding, at this point I wrote it off as being a weird quirk of mine post-partum.  After a week of recovery, I would still feel nauseous during breastfeeding sessions, but not enough to vomit._  **Third traumatic event: oral surgery** Alright, fast-forward to now: up until now, I have been subject to a recurring cold, on a period of approximately 10 days.  Also, as mentioned above, my left tonsil is perpetually swollen quite large.  I recently had the time/funds to get this looked into.  It was suggested to me by my doctor that my symptoms could be due to two possibilities: 1. Babesiosis, and 2. Cavitations leftover from a wisdom-tooth extraction from 7 years ago.  I went to an oral surgeon in Denver and he ran x-rays, scans, etc., and he not only found cavitations in all four sites, but also leftover roots in my lower-right wisdom-tooth site.  Being the kind of person that would rather pursue creating an environment of healing for my body, and wanting to treat a tonsillectomy as a last resort, I opted for an operation in which said oral surgeon would remove the roots, and fill the cavitations.  The operation was scheduled to occur six-days ago (on Valentine's day no less!), and the operation was completed successfully (with the following oddity: whatever sedative he gave me did not work.  He apparently gave me \"6 times what I give to a grown man\" and I was still aware of everything going on and could even feel portions of the procedure at a level which I could have done without.  This seems to be genetic, as my grandfather and mother both describe the same phenomenon applying to them as well; it sucks).  He had me on 2 Tylenol + 3 Ibuprofen every six hours, but that really irritated my stomach, so I stopped as soon as the pain abated to a manageable level (approx two days after the operation).  Sure enough, two days after the operation, I began to vomit as I had after the births of my two children, and I am currently at the point where I cannot hold any liquids/solids down.  If I sit in a hot bath, it calms me down and I temporarily feel better, but it does not help me keep anything down.  I can typically sneak a few fluids and easy solids in in the morning, but that's it.  This event makes me think that, contrary to me previously believing this phenomenon would only apply after I gave birth, that this might have a wider effect on me than I previously thought.  I am really at a loss.  I know it will eventually pass, but it really sucks as I have to take prolonged time off from regular duties, and I feel just awful.  I would really like to figure out the root cause of what's going on in my body to cause it to respond in this fashion.  If anybody has any clues or pointers for me as I search out a cause, it would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for reading\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Can Anyone Help Me Understand What Happened to my Dad? My 64 year old dad passed away 8 weeks ago from colon cancer.  Everything happened so fast that I am not sure I understand exactly how this happened, and I am hoping someone with more knowledge about cancer can help explain things.  Basically, my dad had never gone for colon cancer screenings (I know this is not good but he was one of those people who do not go to the doctor much). This time last year, in July, he was perfectly healthy except that he had a lot of gas. Not pain or bloating, just gas. Sometimes trapped gas that would go away. We all assumed it was a consequence of getting older or food intolerance, and since he had no other symptoms we never considered it alarming.  In October-November, my dad started getting bad insomnia unrelated to the gas. By December, I noticed he had lost some weight, but he had also stopped eating junk food and started walking every morning so we figured it was a result of this.   In January, he had some constipation on and off and complained of hip pain. He had these symptoms from January until March, on and off. He continued to lose weight, but lived normally and continued to be active, had a normal appetite, etc. Finally, after I begged him for a month to see a doctor, he saw one in mid-March. He had a routine blood test that revealed bad liver counts (elevated ALP) that my doctor said was gallstones. He was scheduled for a non-urgent ultrasound to investigate this.   The ultrasound was at the beginning of April, and this is where everything sped up and with COVID, we were unable to be there with my dad for most appointments. The ultrasound showed his liver was full of masses, and a CT scan the next day showed cancer in the colon. Lungs were clear, hip was clear. Still, he was referred non-urgently for follow-up at a cancer centre, and our doctor said he could possibly have chemo and surgery for the liver. This gave us what proved to be false hope.   However, two weeks later, before he could be seen at the cancer centre, his behaviour got strange - paranoia - and he became too weak to walk. We had him admitted to the ER, and they did another CT scan which showed cancer not only in the liver where the ALP tripled since a few weeks earlier, but in the lungs, both adrenal glands, and two tumors in the brain. The doctors were all shocked at how widespread the cancer was, but said with treatment he would have 6-18 months. He had brain surgery, and was scheduled for follow-up, but his doctors refused to give him chemo or radiation and did nothing to address the liver tumors. He passed away a couple weeks later and less than a month after the masses were found in the liver. We couldn't be in the hospital with him because of COVID but they had promised to let us visit when it was close to the end. But the end came so suddenly that we were not informed until after it happened.  What I want to know is, why did this all happen so quickly? Everything I have read about colon cancer says that even at stage 4 it is slow-growing, and life expectancy can be many months. How could he not have cancer in the lungs or adrenal glands weeks earlier and then suddenly have cancer there? Why did his doctors give up on him so quickly and not immediately help his liver when the ALP was rising so quickly and he was getting swelling from liver failure? Why was he referred non-urgently if the liver was so quickly being destroyed by tumors? Why did they say 6-18 months when he passed in less than one? Why was his decline - weight loss and weakness especially - so quick once he was in the hospital? What was the ultimate cause of death and why was it sudden? Is it common to find colon cancer in such an advanced stage?  Because of COVID, nobody ever followed up with us about how all of this happened so fast and so aggressively. I had done so much research about colon cancer and the many chemotherapies and treatment options, and I am heartbroken and angry that my dad did not get a chance to try a single one when it seems like EVERYONE is given standard chemo and biologics and radiation, even just for palliative care. I really feel like the doctors went from saying it wasn't urgent, to giving up on him, with no in-between. I am so angry we got no chance to fight this, and I am so sad he had to come to terms with his mortality so quickly after being given false hope at longer survival. Why did this all happen like this, and is it common that colon cancer give no symptoms until it is everywhere?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Does my Husband (31) have mental heal issues or is he a jerk?    So I have been having the hardest year of my life with my current husband with whom I have been with for a total of 7 years. We met in our mid twenties and generally had a pretty happy relationship. Things started to go south slowly in mid 2017 with the pressure of getting engaged, planning a wedding and dealing with our difficult and dysfunctional families. In addition we were also starting our careers, living in a HCOL area and generally figuring out adulthood. We are also two very different people who came to blows over many differences and were generally poor with conflict resolution.  We had our lows but would always find a way out and be happy again.  At the start of this year, however, things seem to slowly unravel. My husband suddenly started getting panic attacks this January. Seeing as he was someone who never had anxiety or panic attacks, he was very disturbed by this. He genuinely thought he was dying, and had breakdowns. I took him to the ER, and called the EMTs multiple times at 3 am as he would wake up in a panic saying he was dying. They all cleared him saying he was healthy.  Around March he went to a GP for a checkup who looked at his EKG, read it incorrectly and told him he was dying. Within 30 minutes he called my husband back and said actually he made an error and everything was normal. This seemed to have really spooked my husband to the core. After that for the next few weeks he thought he had heart troubles and would not listen to me as I tried to reason with him.  I finally had him visit a cardiologist who indeed confirmed his heart was fine. We then went back to his GP who said that my husband was suffering from extreme stress and anxiety and needed to be put on medication. She prescribed him 10 mg Lexapro. The Lexapro was a god sent in the sense that it finally erased his panic attacks and shortness of breath. Things seem to finally slowly calm down and go back to normal.  A few weeks on Lexapro I started to notice slight changes in his personality. Suddenly he was colder and more distant. The soft, warm sweetness of his personality was replaced by coldness and anger. Now that his panic attacks and anxiety were gone, suddenly everything else was wrong. He said he hated his job that he previously loved and excelled at. He said he was bored and wanted to quit to join the police academy or start his own business, His family and I cautioned him that he needed to not act suddenly and think things through. Anything we said that wasn't affirmative was met with resistance and anger.  He also started drinking heavily. While my husband has always liked to drink, his daily 2 glasses of wine have now turned into a bottle of wine per night. He also goes out with his friends and gets blasted drunk and parties and bar hops until 2- 3 am in the morning. When I tell him he needs to come home earlier, he gets mean and aggressive and tells me to stop being a fun killer!  Suddenly I am his enemy no.1. He seems to have re-written our entire story where everything about our relationship and marriage is wrong. He hates and resents me for the hurt I have caused him and says he feels trapped and caged. He screams at me, yells at me and has scary episodes. For example, if he comes home at 2 am after bar hopping and I say anything about him staying out too late, he will walk into the kitchen, grab a bottle of wine say he is getting out of here and go lock himself in our car!!  He has also started sexting and chatting and calling with random women from hook up apps. I discovered him receiving nudes from a woman a month ago. When I confronted him about it he screamed at me that he wanted a divorce and ran away to stay with his parents. Another time when I tried to confront him again he screamed at me, took his bottle of wine and locked himself out side in our car. When I tried to go outside and get him to come inside and stalk to me like a normal person, he screamed at me and drove off drunk into the night at 3 am. He did not return home until an hour later.  Recently I discovered that he has been having sex with hookers in hotel rooms. He has recently started not coming home or coming home late after work. He always stays at the office until 3- 4 am and sexts chats and sends nude selfies to random women based on what I have seen on his phone.  If he does come home, he will stay up till 3 am by himself watching a movie and drinking.  Occasionally he will seem to have a moment of clarity, apologize profusely and tell me he doesn't know what he is doing. He gets these extreme rushes of emotions and he cant seem to control himself. The rest of the time when I bring up that something isn't normal he says I am the enemy and he hates me and I need to leave him alone and throws a tantrum and runs away.  I am at my wits end. I do not know what is going on with him. He is an asshole or is he suffering from some mental health issue?  TLDR; My 31 year old husband has been acting increasingly erratic, aggressive, mean and is cheating on me. I don't know what to do as this all seems very out of character.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " First of all, I am sorry that this has been a tough year for you.  It has to be super distressing to see someone you love and care about struggling so much.  Even more so that you are seemingly punished for sharing that concern.  Going to agree with others who shared impressions of combination of undertreated mental illness and addiction.  I could speculate on diagnoses, but I think that would be of limited utility to you as the concerned party (not to mention unethical).  Agree with med student above that this could be drug-induced mania or an independent mania that is not well-controlled by lexapro.    How you have this conversation with him is the difficult part, as you have already identified.  I think you are on the right path in speaking about this in medical terms, and this might be your means to help him seek care.  When he is acutely intoxicated is probably not the best time to share your concern.  If you are able to have a conversation with him when he is not drunk - try to do so from a calm but firm place of being really worried about his health.  It can end with \"When can we make an appointment to see GP/Psychiatrist , how can I help this happen?\"  You can also speak to emotions underneath the rage \"I think you are really scared right now, I can tell you are really worried and hurting.\"  No guarantees he will seek further care, but you can at least know you did your level best.  If he does agree, make sure to tell him beforehand that you intend to share the full scope of his behavior with his physician/treatment provider.  \"I want them to be able to know everything so they can get you the best care.\"  Lastly, you can't help anyone else if you aren't caring for yourself.  This sounds pretty stressful and you deserve your own support beyond what we might offer you on reddit.  He's a lucky to have a caring partner who is willing to go to great lengths to see him well again.   Best of luck in seeing that through."

    "\n\nHuman: My son just passed away in a horrific way that I can\u2019t unsee and I\u2019m left with a lot of questions  On 5/20/22 my [0.2m] son (2 months old) passed away at the hospital after being diagnosed with cancerous tumors in his head, lungs, kidneys and multiple in his abdomen seen by ct scan 12 days prior. I don\u2019t know what happened exactly but his actual death was so graphic and traumatizing and now it won\u2019t stop replaying in my head and now I\u2019m just scared and confused.   He woke up at 10:30 that morning with low oxygen levels (80-90), around 11:30-12pm his oxygen levels reached 0% and his whole body turned blue. After a few minutes he started gasping for air and then would let out a whine. I held him through this whole thing because I made a promise that I would not leave his side. He stayed dark blue and was gasping for air every minute or so for hours. He was not on a ventilator so I\u2019m not sure how he survived that long with no oxygen but he did. I was told he was brain dead and that he was not aware of what was happening so that\u2019s what I kept telling myself to get me through this horrible experience.. yet he was opening and closing his eyes when I talked to him and grasping my finger.   But it gets worse.. hours go by of him gasping for air and whining then he starts flat lining for a minute or two at a time and then his pulse jumps back up to 90-100bpm on his own. Then he would make awful choking sounds with each breath, the nurse said it was a death rattle. By this time I can see he has sweat around his mouth and his eyes went opposite directions and his tongue was sticking out. Around 8pm it gets worse and by this time his lips and nose are dark purple and the whites of his eyes were turning a red color like blood vessels may have popped. I was terrified and I couldn\u2019t handle seeing him like that but I didn\u2019t want to leave my baby so I stayed..   at 8:40pm all of a sudden his body curls up like he was trying to sit up then he opened his eyes, looked right at me, let out a cry and his whole body turned dark purple almost black. He looked like he was choking for a second then blood and yellowish liquid just poured from his nose and mouth until he stopped breathing. It was a lot of blood but I was told that\u2019s from low WBC count. I ran out of the room screaming for someone to help him but because he had a disease he was a DNR. He suffered for hours and when he looked right at me I felt like he was looking at me helplessly and I couldn\u2019t help him\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I feel terrible and I can\u2019t believe my baby had to go through that\ud83d\ude2d was he alive through all of that? Why did that happen to him? I\u2019m not sure if a tumor ruptured or why he just stopped breathing all of a sudden? I couldn\u2019t look at my son after that experience and I regret it but now I\u2019m afraid to view his body before cremation because I\u2019m scared he will look worse than my last memory of him. I was under the impression that death was going to be like going to sleep and not waking up, nobody prepared me for what actually happened. They won\u2019t do an autopsy either because he was diagnosed with cancer so now I\u2019m left wondering why all of that happened. He seemed fine before that when when I laid him down at 5am.\n\nAssistant:": {

I don\u2019t have much to offer other than if he had 0% oxygen what you were seeing was likely agonal breathing and not him actually consciously gasping for breath. This is the body\u2019s autonomic nervous system trying to stay alive but the person can be already gone before this happens and it can look like they\u2019re gasping for air. If it helps, I once watched a video of a man who survived an agonal breathing episode/serious medical issue and he said he was not conscious of anything and did not feel it. This was extremely traumatic to witness and I am so very sorry for you. I would definitely seek care of a mental health professional as you may have developed PTSD from seeing this.",
            " I am very sorry that you went through this. The loss of a child is never easy and it hurts forever.  I have to tell you that your experience is actually somewhat common. I have presided over the deaths of countless children, sadly. People have this view of death as \u201cslipping quietly away,\u201d but children have incredibly resilient bodies and their struggle to maintain life functions at the end can be much longer and more violent. If there is any good news, it is that your son was almost certainly not aware of what was happening, or consciously feeling any pain. You were witnessing some very deep, automatic brain functions going through the process of shutting down - functions that only turn on when consciousness has already failed. This is often more traumatic for witnesses than it is for the child. By allowing him to go through that process naturally and without artificial prolongation, you were actually choosing to bear that trauma and pain so he wouldn\u2019t have to - an act of extreme love and devotion to your son. The fact that it hurts so much is only a testament to how much you cared for him. I do hope you will see a counselor to help you process your grief, they can he tremendously helpful. And I know you will lose a great deal of sleep over his loss. But hopefully you can rest a little easier knowing that he was not suffering excessively at the end."

I have presided over the deaths of countless children, sadly. People have this view of death as \u201cslipping quietly away,\u201d but children have incredibly resilient bodies and their struggle to maintain life functions at the end can be much longer and more violent. If there is any good news, it is that your son was almost certainly not aware of what was happening, or consciously feeling any pain. You were witnessing some very deep, automatic brain functions going through the process of shutting down - functions that only turn on when consciousness has already failed. This is often more traumatic for witnesses than it is for the child. By allowing him to go through that process naturally and without artificial prolongation, you were actually choosing to bear that trauma and pain so he wouldn\u2019t have to - an act of extreme love and devotion to your son. The fact that it hurts so much is only a testament to how much you cared for him. I do hope you will see a counselor to help you process your grief, they can he tremendously helpful. And I know you will lose a great deal of sleep over his loss. But hopefully you can rest a little easier knowing that he was not suffering excessively at the end.",

I don\u2019t have much to offer other than if he had 0% oxygen what you were seeing was likely agonal breathing and not him actually consciously gasping for breath. This is the body\u2019s autonomic nervous system trying to stay alive but the person can be already gone before this happens and it can look like they\u2019re gasping for air. If it helps, I once watched a video of a man who survived an agonal breathing episode/serious medical issue and he said he was not conscious of anything and did not feel it. This was extremely traumatic to witness and I am so very sorry for you. I would definitely seek care of a mental health professional as you may have developed PTSD from seeing this."

    "\n\nHuman: 22 Year old male, with constant urge to urinate every 5 to 10 minutes, never feel like bladder is empty, when i try to force urine out at the end of urinating a white cloud that looks like pus, comes out instead of urine. I have to pee every 10 minutes,  some times a little, sometimes alot, and it never feels like i fully empty my bladder. At the end of urinating ill try to force more urine out, but instead a white cloud will come out instead of urine.  It looks like pus,  or semen and seems to happen more at night.  I have had urine and blood tests and all that, doesnt seem to an STD.  I also have lower back pain and abdomen pain, doctors dont think its a kidney stone since its been going on for a long time. Any ideas on what it could be,  and what i should do?\n\nAssistant:": {

Male: 17, 60kg (132 pounds), dont smoke, dont drink, physicslly active: runner, medication: bupropion, medical conditions: depression, height: 175cm (5 foot 7). Basically i think i got the flu. I had 105.8 degree (41 celcius) fever yesterday and couldnt drink or eat nor walk. Had a heartbeat of 110 when i was lying down doing nothing. Was about to put on a surigcal mask to prevent spreading the disease and jumping on a train to the hosp, but felt like i was being overdramatic and too weak so i stayed home.  I slept 14h today, and i am feeling a bit better, fever down to 104, slower heart beat, could eat and drink. Probably has something to do with the fact that i took fever and infammation lindering meds. But now my lips and fingernails are turning dark purple and im worried it might have something to do with oxygen intace, or the lack of it? I study and live abroad so no parents who can take care of me. Should i put on a mask to prevent spreading the virus and get on a train to the hosp or wait for a bit longer and see if i improve? I have insurance.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: 22F I\u2019m desperate for answers, I\u2019m losing the will to live, please somebody help me? 22F, 165.1cm, 138lbs, White British Duration: Since ?birth Severe acid reflux which has got worse since January; EXTREME WEIGHT LOSS, excessive violent vomiting with red/coffee ground blood sometimes, upper abdominal and chest, shoulder, upper back pain.  Medical conditions: Atrial septal defect(tiny aneurysm), heart Murmur, Acid reflux, Anxiety. Meds: Lansoprazole OR Omeprazole, Gaviscon, Pregabalin, Trazadone. I Don\u2019t drink or Smoke or take any drugs.  I am desperate for any advice or answers to what\u2019s happening with me; I am sorry for the long read.  I put a post on here previously asking advice about my condition, and I got loads of helpful replies- well since January I have lost an alarming 42lbs, I am getting new pains which have started in my upper back, my shoulders, under my ribs in my ?lungs, also pain when I breathe in, also important for this, I had a seizure last month whilst I was out with my friend, I had 2 glasses of wine and went into a seizure and was unresponsive for a few hours in the hospital, they said my blood results were very bad but didn\u2019t explain how, said I could have been extremely ?intoxicated, another doctor said it could have been a ?hypo seizure, but I\u2019m not diabetic, I was also vomiting coffee grounds whilst I was unconscious. My condition has worsened to the point where whatever I am eating whether it\u2019s plain food or not I am vomiting up with reflux, I only eat every 2/3 days as I feel I\u2019m developing PTSD from eating, I\u2019m physically scared of the pain and vomiting.. I am getting so low and depressed from what\u2019s going on I\u2019ve thought about suicide.  I had an endoscopy(without the camera) down to test how strong my oesophagus was, I had a barium swallow aswell which both showed up perfect, But I also had an oesophageal pH monitoring test done which is to be kept in for 24hours and you get given a diary and a monitor you\u2019re attached too, which you can record your symptoms in e.g whenever you feel pain, whenever you eat, whenever you lay down and sleep etc; I ended up becoming severely ill when I had this in and had to rip it out after 17 hours as I was projectile vomiting everywhere and in absolute agony. I had my results back from this test which showed I *DO* have some reflux, but I wasn\u2019t experiencing reflux when I was vomiting, or the pain I was recording wasn\u2019t showing as reflux either..? My doctor has said to me that because of this, if I was to be referred to the surgeons they could reject me as it\u2019s not solid evidence of this being reflux and being treatable from surgery which I\u2019m so upset about... My doctor has now referred me for another endoscopy camera to go down with biopsy\u2019s (I had an endoscopy 6 years ago which showed nothing) to hope they can see evidence of what\u2019s going on.. but this won\u2019t happen for a while now because they\u2019ve stopped all surgeries and endoscopys during COVID unless it\u2019s an emergency, and there\u2019s a long waiting list... the doctor said to me I would have to become severely underweight or unwell in order for me to become an emergency...  I am beginning to lose the will to live, every day life is a struggle, I have started to vomit red blood, sometimes coffee grounds but not in large quantities, I have headaches, I\u2019m in agony every day now, I am losing 1-2 pound per day depending.  My symptoms start as Sulphur burps, then I get upper abdomen pain, then chest pain going into my back and shoulders, then I will get gassy, frequent loose stool, which I will be rolling around screaming and crying from the pain and projectile vomit everywhere; and the smell of my vomit is more extreme than normal vomit, boyfriend describes it as battery acid with rotten eggs. Have been admitted to hospital multiple times when this happens, and every time I have hypertension.  I\u2019m desperate for answers, please if anyone has any solutions or maybe answers to what\u2019s going on with me? Any tests that I could ask to have? Or any knowledge of what could be happening with me or conditions, it would help so much, me and my family are worried sick and feel I\u2019m slipping through the cracks.  ** I have had a camera endoscopy 5 years ago which showed nothing but they want to repeat this test now. Also my barium swallow showed no ulcers or hernia **   I will answer any questions you have, just please someone help!\n\nAssistant:": {

The coffee granules is normally a sign for an upper GI bleed. The unplanned weight loss , vomiting blood are all red flags for cancer . Not saying it is cancer just those signs normally makes us go \"suspected cancer \" . Have you had an allergy test done aswell ?   A concern of mine would be, if you vomitting a lot you could be causing a lot of damage to your oesophagus ,  which might be causing the blood to go into your stomach . Do you have a family history of cancer ?  What is the dosage of omeprazole you are on ? Have they tested for H.pylori , might be that aswell, in the UK it is a simple test for H.pylori .

    "\n\nHuman: My mom (58F)was diagnosed with Arachnoiditis, she thinks it\u2019s a death sentence. Is it as bad as she thinks it is? Help! My mom has been going through chronic knee, leg and back pain for about 10 years following a torn meniscus and subsequent double knee replacements due to developing arthritis. Over the years she has received various diagnoses from nerve damage, bulging discs, botched knee replacements/hardware. A few years ago one of her doctors said it looked like she had Arachnoiditis. She got a few other opinions and they disagreed, said they didn\u2019t think she had Arachnoiditis.  Most recently her doctor recommended a hip replacement.  My mom has been on pain meds, had injections, epidurals, you name it. She is still in pain, to the point that some days she says she cannot walk. Today she got the diagnosis of Arachnoiditis.   She thinks it is a death sentence. She is angry and upset that this string of events led her to this diagnosis. She thinks it\u2019s going to take 10-15 years off of her life and be confined to a wheel chair, unable to walk or play with grandkids.   Is this disease as bad as she makes it sound? After doing a quick google search, it seems to me that it is not curable but can be treated with pain meds and management. Nothing says it is terminal, although it is degenerative.    Can any doctors or people with experience with this give me any more information that might be useful to my mother, or anything that can help guide us through dealing with it?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Not a doctor, but it is perfectly normal for someone receiving such a diagnosis to immediately focus on the worst possible outcome. (I honestly think that therapy should be a requirement when you receive a progressive chronic illness diagnosis, as a lot of people don't have the necessary coping mechanisms to process it on their own.)  That said, I would recommend that she finds a good doctor to manage her care, as well as a pain management doctor, a therapist, a physical therapist, and a homeopathic practitioner who provides acupuncture and other non-medicated pain relief. (Maybe a nutritionist as well, as while it won't do much to manage the pain aspect, good nutrition will help ensure  that she maintains a good weight as she does slowly lose mobility, which will help keep stress off her joints.)   This doesn't have to be the death sentence she thinks it will be, but she will make it one if she isn't proactive about managing her condition. She will need a team of specialists to do this. She should also look into aquatic based physical therapy and get into a program as soon as possible. I speak from experience when I say that it really makes a difference in improving and preserving your mobility without triggering further damage or pain like regular physical therapy would.   (I don't have her condition, but I do have lupus, as well as an undiagnosed condition that affects my legs and greatly limits my mobility. It seems to be progressive as well, and these are the steps that I have taken to mitigate it. The physical therapy has been especially helpful. I went from having to have my legs elevated nearly 24/7 to actually being able to sit normally for a few hours, and I can stand and walk for 30 minutes or an hour before the pain gets too bad and my legs lock up, whereas, before, I was lucky to manage 10.)",

    "\n\nHuman: 50, Male - My Father in law was sent home on hospice and was told that he most likely won\u2019t survive the transport home. He made it and is still alive and in good spirits 6 days later. Can someone help me understand? Hi all. My father in law has been sick recently and was sent home on hospice. He has diabetes and about a month ago had a leg amputated above the knee. He has osteomyelitis, pneumonia, MDRO, UTI, and 50% injection rate after a mild heart attack (2 months ago). Last week he was transferred to the ICU from a rehab facility. He was on a ventilator and receiving dialysis daily. He was on a few blood pressure medications and 2-3 antibiotics for his multiple infections. They told us that the prognosis was not good and recommended hospice. Our goal was to get him home to pass with family surrounding him. They doctors had told us that they tried to take him off of the vent the day before and he couldn\u2019t tolerate it longer than an hour. They were saying that there was a good chance that he would not be able to make it through the transport home because he couldn\u2019t be transported without the vent. So on Friday they took him off of the vent and he made it home. Once home they took him off of IV Levophed. They were expecting him to pass shortly after. However this didn\u2019t happen.   Now, 6 days later, he is still alive and in good spirits. He has refused any pain medication and says he doesn\u2019t have any pain. His lungs still sound really bad and he\u2019s requiring frequent suction because he\u2019s coughing up a lot. His o2 saturation has been in the upper 90s. His BP and heart rate are low (couldn\u2019t give you exact readings).   I\u2019m just confused about all of this. They weren\u2019t expecting him to even make it home. He made it and he\u2019s still alive 6 days later. I understand that he is most likely going to pass soon. I\u2019m not in denial about that. I\u2019m just confused as to why he has lasted this long. He was requiring dialysis daily. I figured after a few days he would have passed. I feel almost guilty like we should have waited before making the choice to take him home on hospice. I feel like he might have had a chance for even a slight improvement to give him more time. I guess what I\u2019m trying to understand is, they told us he was in critical condition and was going to die very very soon, as in most likely the same day he gets home. Is the fact that he\u2019s still alive indicative of any improvement or proof that he wasn\u2019t as sick as they thought he was? This has all thrown us on a rollercoaster of emotions and I think the guilt is setting in for all of us.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " I'm a hospice nurse.  We see these kinds of situations all the time.  The criteria to qualify for hospice is not that the patient is expected to die immediately (and, frankly, at that point it really defeats the purpose of hospice), but that, if the patient's disease runs it's expected course, the patient likely has 6 months or less left to live. It doesn't mean that the patient will definitely die in six months, but it's based on the referring physician's medical judgment.   Patients come home on hospice and the idea is that we try to make the most of the time they have left, as well as managing any symptoms they have.  Oftentimes, a patient's routine medications that are not helping symptom-wise are discontinued.  Many times, patients feel better after stopping some meds that can have uncomfortable side effects.  We also work with a hospice pharmacist to treat symptoms and the medications we use can greatly improve a patient's overall well-being. Sometimes patients feel better just getting out of the hospital and being at home with family.    We currently have some patients who have been on hospice for more than a year.  We've had patients in the past who have done so well that they've been discharged from hospice.    It sounds to me like your situation is one where the medical team had determined there really isn't anything more they can do to try treat/cure the underlying illness so they recommended that he go home and be made as comfortable as possible. Of course, specific questions should be directed to the treating physicians but your hospice nurses are also a good resource for answers as to what his current condition is.   I'm sorry your family is going through this. I encourage you to talk to the hospice team, they will be working to make the most of the time your loved one has left."

    "\n\nHuman: Update to Previous Post Regarding Cough Up Blood After Workout. Results Were Surprising    Age: 31  Sex: M  Height: 6'6\"  Weight: 250 Athletic  Race: White/Caucasian  Duration: 4 1/2 Months  Location: Lungs/Upper Respiratory, Upper G/I  Current Diagnosis: **Stage 4 Aggressive Gastro-Intestinal Cancer**  Current Meds: Pain Killers, Diuretics  As needed Meds: Lidocaine Patches, Anti-Nausea,  M**elatonin** sleep aid  Original:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/c2ls61/chronic\\_cough\\_and\\_now\\_coughing\\_up\\_blood\\_after/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&utm\\_source=share   So after spending some time at an Urgent Care, getting some scans lined up and trying to be patient, I woke up one morning to pain and compression over my chest. Urgent Care Docs had advised me that any escalation of symptoms should mean I go to the Emergency Room. Once there they almost immediately checked me into the ICU for observation and began running every test you could name. For the next 4/5 days I did just an unreal number of scans, 2 biopsies, and they drew enough blood to fill a small pool. Pain escalated daily while there so finding a solution was a running theme. So after a lot of trails here's what they found:  Current: Stage 4 Aggressive Metastatic Gastrointestinal Cancer ( Adenocarcinoma )  Previous: Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation   After doing a Lymph Node & Bone Marrow Biopsy they found my marrow filled to capacity with dead cancer cells. This pointed them in the right direction. My platelets were crashing daily (20,000 at admission) and I've got inflamed lymph nodes throughout my chest cavity which is one source of my (significant and at time escalating) pain. Its infiltrated my lungs and several vertebrae along my spine (causing vertebrae to show signs of Osteopenia) . Weirdly enough there's no noticeable tumor/mass/lump they can trace it back to. It's kind of just spread throughout (described as Adenocarcinoma) , though they were finally able to locate a small ulcer in my stomach that allowed them to finally be able to classify it. I've currently just completed my 3rd (now weekly) round of chemo (we started asap when other options such as clinical trials were deemed a non-option) and we've been able to stabilize a number of things (blood factors such as platelets, hemoglobin and the like) along the way. Many of my blood counts are still in the trash so clinical trails are not currently an option. In early stages of my 3 weeks hospital visit I was in a state called **DIC (**Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) which caused me to act like something akin to a blood squirt gun if i bled. Essentialy it screws with you clotting factors and any bleeding event is an issue. Any procedure became an issue and many my numbers were artifically raised in order to attempt anything that would cause me to bleed. Fortunately after a week of treatments and what felt like several wheel barrows of infusions we kicked my body out of D.I.C and am more or less clotting normally. Fun story: early one morning after the vampires took their daily does of my blood a CNA came in to do a routine vitals check. This particular morning they took 2 unique sets of blood samples plus a rather large sample for testing against infectious disease. This was also kind of at the height of my \"he's not clotting\" phase. During the blood pressure check it popped open all the fresh holes in my arm, causing them to bleed and freaked/surprised the CNA. Made me laugh. (end of story).  Immunotherapy is what my Oncologist are banking on right now so crossing my fingers. Chemo is causing reasonable progress (numbers are low but stable) so we're staying the course for now. My personal mid->long term goal is to find an alternative to opiates for pain management (who the hell knows why a person tolerates opiates for a buzz cause constipation sucks!!!) so looking at alternatives (THC pills potentially or preferably resolving the issue that's causing me pain)  I've been discharged from the hospital after 3 weeks so now I'm working to find a routine that works. Losing weight so a short term goal is stopping that (I'm rather tall and (was) muscular so my bodies nuking whatever calories I put in and I'm not putting in a lot due to general nausea, but smoothies have been my friend. Please let me know if you have any questions or advice.. I'll answer what I can and absorb what reasonable advice I read.\n\nAssistant:": {

Colace, stool softeners, the like can help. During chemo I recommend ginger chews for nausea btw. And of course the miracle of Zofran which you are probably already on.    THC may or may not work, it depends on the person really. It's worth a try and I also second the Marinol suggestion below.  There is also cannabis patches which could help, especially if you have slow gastric transit due to the opioids.",

            " Not a doctor, and I'm really sorry to hear about your diagnosis and wish you the best of luck on remission. As far as the pain meds/thc goes, I have lupus and a lot of chronic pain from it and related issues, opiates don't help the pain and I avoid them entirely. Prednisone is the best pain reliever for me but that's because it helps the underlying problem, and I do take NSAIDs as well, but thc has been a significant part of my pain regimen too. I will warn you it doesn't actually take away pain, like almost at all, instead, it makes it easier to handle the same level of pain, which is still useful. The side effects are also much more tolerable than opiates, and it would likely help with your appetite and nausea as well. That being said, if you live in a legal or medical state, obviously you should avoid smoking, get some RSO and start off slow and low, it goes a long way.

            " OOF. (forgot to add Not a doctor) Welcome to the club friend. Stage 4 cancer fucking sucks but it isn't always a death sentence. I was diagnosed w/ stage 4 synovial sarcoma in 2017 (with more specific parameters that made my odds even less than stellar.. my primary site was 14.5cm at diagnosis!). Don't give up until you have to, we have more options than ever before. Support groups for your specific type of cancer (or as close as you can get to your specific subtype) are an incredible blessing and wealth of information. Infusions are great energy boosters, though, aren't they? ;) lol. I'm assuming the 2 samples were for blood cultures? It always looks like they are taking a shit ton even though they aren't. If you can get into an immunotherapy trial, DO IT. I was SO CLOSE to one but they wouldn't accept me as I was out of state with an insurance that would cover nothing. Alternatives for opiates is hard, I would go for straight up vaping medical grade marijuana if you can access it, my oncologists and palliative have both not so subtly told me \"off the record\" that they prefer that over prescribing the \"pot pill,\" and it's not acceptable in my state either, they just turn a blind eye to it. I haven't done it this round of chemo, but it was the only way I was able to deal with it the first time (I was on much harsher stuff back then, probably similar to the hell I imagine you're dealing with (was AIM plus votrient if you're wondering)). Miralax is personally my favorite to help with constipation. It's mild enough that I never get diarrhea from it and that was a big issue with other laxatives. As long as I take it every day, everything stays moving. I did a lot of slushies and milkshakes. Making smoothies with the meal replacement drinks can help a ton (I personally think the chocolate boost tastes the best and boost is leaps better than ensure). Try different brands and different flavors. The hospital nutritionists didn't care if I didn't eat as long as I had the replacement crap. I am doing instant breakfast (the powder type) this time since I can tolerate milk. If you have mouth pain asking your doctor to write you a prescription for \"magic mouthwash\" can help, but it can be hard to get it filled nowadays as most pharmacies won't mix a compounded formula. I unfortunately had severe mouth and throat swelling from it xD but the mouth pain passed for me.

She has kept down 4 ounces and two rice crackers since 9:30 am today (which is an improvement) I am in an area where RSV and Covid are on the rampage.

    "\n\nHuman: My cat bit me while getting an injection today, my finger really hurts, should I take an antibiotic just in case? 35F, 120lbs, on propranolol since March, no chronic illnesses, incident with cat bite happened today around 6 hours ago  My cat has a terminal brain tumor so her behavior can be quite unpredictable. Last week at the vets she was an angel, but today the demon came out during an injection and she bit me twice, on my index finger and middle finger. The vet sprayed antiseptic and bandaged my fingers after this happened. I took the bandages off at home.  The index finger is more or less ok, a bit of tenderness and swelling, but its not bad. The middle finger is much worse, it hurts and is warm and swollen; it really hurts when I try to bend it. It was oozing clear/yellow liquid for a few hours from the puncture (looked like urine). The oozing has stopped now.  I'm thinking perhaps I should get a prescription for an antibiotic, but my husband says I'm overreacting.   What's the best course of action here?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Being told by surgeon and other medical professionals that my surgery and recovery will be extremely painful and it's starting to freak me out. Considering bailing. Hello.  My stats are:  32M  6'0  260lbs  White  Welbutrin ER 200mg x2 daily Venlafaxine 150mg morning/75mg night and 1mg Clonapin at bedtime. These treat diagnosed severe Depression, General Anxiety Disorder, and Insomnia.  I do not smoke or use recreational drugs. I consume alcohol around 2-4 times a year. I've had two alcoholic drinks this year.  I'm not sure how much I truely understand but from what I understand, I have thrombosed, external hemorrhoids, fissures, an abcess?, and a few more internal ones. Apparently my muscles are weak and they told me they suspect it all started when I was shoveling wet, heavy snow. All 4 professionals I've spoken with went into great detail how it's going to be extremely painful for about 8 weeks. There is no avaliable support system to answer my questions. They didn't even explain what they were gonna do beyond open me up and fix stuff. I already have GAD and the uncertainty and seeming lack of concern makes me wonder if this is absolutely neccessary? They don't seem to have a sense of urgency when getting in touch with me or answering my questions so I'm starting to doubt them.  The doctors seemed less than happy that I didn't have anyone to help me home or help me at home. But I'm not a millionaire and can barely afford this as it is. I definitely cannot afford staying in the hospital for any length of time.  Two frieds are telling me to bail. Both are women and have suffered complications from surgery, one of them even caught a superbug, I think MRSA. They're telling me I'm basically being viewed as a paycheck and not a person.  Any medical professionals have any advice or suggestions? I would appreciate it. Ty.\n\nAssistant:": {

Prior to the procedure, please inform him you were **told by the staff** it will be an extremely painful procedure & being that you have anxiety disorder this is making you feel uncomfortable about it.  Another question to ask the physician is \"I had 2 friends who got MRSA, and I'm afraid I will get it as well. What precautions do you take to prevent it, and what can I do from my end as well?\"  Otherwise get a second opinion from a general surgeon at another institution if that helps you.

            " This thread is filled with \"Not a doctor\" comments giving questionable information and advice. Here is some feedback based off of my experience at our institution.   It is hard to tell from your post what your actual problem is and what actual procedure they are planning on doing. Internal and external hemorrhoids, fistulas and abscesses are all different things, but may be all present at the same time. There is a very wide range of procedures used to repair all these issues, some of which are more painful than others. Based off of multiple providers telling you to expect pain I would hazard a guess that they are planning on an open hemroiddectomy, plus possibly other procedures depending on if they find fistulas or abscesses intraop. You can Google some images of hemorrhoidectomy, but I'll warn you that it is very hard to understand what they do unless you have actually seen one and the pictures look the procedure look a good deal more horrible than it actually is.  You should expect to be quite sore because it is a very sensitive area, but to claim that you will be in excruciating pain for 8 weeks is an exaggeration. The surgeons at my hospital do give out more pain medicine for these sorts of procedures than they do for any other colorectal surgeries or other general surgeries, but that being said, these procedures are very common and people get through them with medication and guidance from the surgical team.   Is this truly a necessary surgery? I can't tell you that without seeing you, but I think it's a fair bet that if multiple people have told you you need an operation that you probably do. Hemorrhoids past a certain severity are not likely to improve on their own, and if you don't have them fixed you may be dealing with them for a very long time. Get another opinion if it will help put your mind at rest, but it's probably worth it. I WOULD recommend that you have it performed by a colorectal specialist surgeon, not by a general surgeon. Some other comments mention postop complications which can occur with even the best surgeon, but are much less common when these procedures are performed by fellowship trained colorectal surgeons.

            " GI office coordinator here. What types of professionals have you seen that have explained this? PA, MD? Several different clinics? While I can\u2019t reply to the recovery portion, I can advise on the experience you\u2019re having with the clinic.  We occasionally diagnose thrombosed hemorrhoids in my clinic and most often send them to a colorectal surgeon for the simple fact that the outcomes are usually better. If you\u2019re seeing a general surgeon, I would go back to whoever initially referred you to the surgeon (GI or PCP) and ask for a referral to colorectal. If the referral source isn\u2019t being helpful, reach out to your insurance and see who is in network and contact them directly. Most often they want a referral, but your PCP can write you one of you haven\u2019t started with them; if you go to them with a name of the surgeon you want a referral to, PCP will generally oblige.  If you\u2019re limited in options and this is the absolute only clinic, first I would call your insurance and ask for an approval for an out of network referral to get a second opinion. It might be a wait to get it approved, but the important thing is that you feel fully informed about the surgery and comfortable with the doctor performing it.   I would also contact the clinic which isn\u2019t being supportive and speak to the office manager. Unfortunately there\u2019s sometimes a high turnover for non-provider staff in clinics and patients get lost in the shuffle. Be polite, firm, and provide dates/times in which you contacted the clinic and didn\u2019t get a response, or got a generic, nonhelpful one. It might be good to write everything down so you discuss everything you want to bring up. Send a follow up letter via certified mail addressed to the manager of you feel like you\u2019re getting the brush off.  Some clinics are affiliated with a larger health system; you can also contact the health system patient advocate or experience team if you feel like you\u2019re getting nowhere with the clinic.",

It is hard to tell from your post what your actual problem is and what actual procedure they are planning on doing. Internal and external hemorrhoids, fistulas and abscesses are all different things, but may be all present at the same time. There is a very wide range of procedures used to repair all these issues, some of which are more painful than others. Based off of multiple providers telling you to expect pain I would hazard a guess that they are planning on an open hemroiddectomy, plus possibly other procedures depending on if they find fistulas or abscesses intraop. You can Google some images of hemorrhoidectomy, but I'll warn you that it is very hard to understand what they do unless you have actually seen one and the pictures look the procedure look a good deal more horrible than it actually is.  You should expect to be quite sore because it is a very sensitive area, but to claim that you will be in excruciating pain for 8 weeks is an exaggeration. The surgeons at my hospital do give out more pain medicine for these sorts of procedures than they do for any other colorectal surgeries or other general surgeries, but that being said, these procedures are very common and people get through them with medication and guidance from the surgical team.   Is this truly a necessary surgery? I can't tell you that without seeing you, but I think it's a fair bet that if multiple people have told you you need an operation that you probably do. Hemorrhoids past a certain severity are not likely to improve on their own, and if you don't have them fixed you may be dealing with them for a very long time. Get another opinion if it will help put your mind at rest, but it's probably worth it. I WOULD recommend that you have it performed by a colorectal specialist surgeon, not by a general surgeon. Some other comments mention postop complications which can occur with even the best surgeon, but are much less common when these procedures are performed by fellowship trained colorectal surgeons.   Best of luck.",
            " Not a doctor, but here's what I bet is going on.    If they don't tell you about the pain, you'll be calling them every week, worried whether you're healing, stressing that there may be a problem. If they tell you it'll be really painful, you'll probably be pleasantly surprised and not freak out when it takes a while to be pain free.    Remember, this is the part of your body that can accumulate sweat and bacteria. You still have to poop during the healing process and you're still going to sit down on your butt sometimes. If you don't follow aftercare, your chance of getting an infection is higher. In my unprofessional opinion, the pain is mostly going to be due to bowel movements. However, chances are, you're in plenty of pain now. I think you'll be surprised. They're preparing you for the worst case scenario.    To give you a tiny story, I had a fissure at one point that caused me pain like you wouldn't believe. I was afraid it was a hemorrhoid and that i would have to get surgery. Finally, I had the balls to go to the doctor, and he told me that the pain I experienced was way worse than what hemorrhoid surgery would be. With a little TLC, I was good.    You have anxiety. You're going to worry even without it. But I think you'll also be fine. I'm sure your friends are just trying to help you, but you may refrain from talking to them about the surgery, if you get it done, until afterwards, just so you can try to keep your cool. An abscess of any sort is a problem that you don't want to get worse. Research, ask your doctor ALL the questions, and try to make an informed decision. You've made it this far in life so you've already proven that you can be brave.",

            " GI office coordinator here. What types of professionals have you seen that have explained this? PA, MD? Several different clinics? While I can\u2019t reply to the recovery portion, I can advise on the experience you\u2019re having with the clinic.  We occasionally diagnose thrombosed hemorrhoids in my clinic and most often send them to a colorectal surgeon for the simple fact that the outcomes are usually better. If you\u2019re seeing a general surgeon, I would go back to whoever initially referred you to the surgeon (GI or PCP) and ask for a referral to colorectal. If the referral source isn\u2019t being helpful, reach out to your insurance and see who is in network and contact them directly. Most often they want a referral, but your PCP can write you one of you haven\u2019t started with them; if you go to them with a name of the surgeon you want a referral to, PCP will generally oblige.  If you\u2019re limited in options and this is the absolute only clinic, first I would call your insurance and ask for an approval for an out of network referral to get a second opinion. It might be a wait to get it approved, but the important thing is that you feel fully informed about the surgery and comfortable with the doctor performing it.   I would also contact the clinic which isn\u2019t being supportive and speak to the office manager. Unfortunately there\u2019s sometimes a high turnover for non-provider staff in clinics and patients get lost in the shuffle. Be polite, firm, and provide dates/times in which you contacted the clinic and didn\u2019t get a response, or got a generic, nonhelpful one. It might be good to write everything down so you discuss everything you want to bring up. Send a follow up letter via certified mail addressed to the manager of you feel like you\u2019re getting the brush off.  Some clinics are affiliated with a larger health system; you can also contact the health system patient advocate or experience team if you feel like you\u2019re getting nowhere with the clinic.",

I had to sit on a soft pillow for at least a month after, or I was in an intense amount of pain. I woke up with my lower half numbed, so I didn't feel anything the first day, the second day I woke up screaming because I stupidly didn't take my pain meds because I was dumb. HOWEVER. I was given some strong pain killers (oxy) and as long as I took them as prescribed on time, I was in a very tolerable amount of pain (think heavy soreness). Using the restroom is the worst part of it, really. I needed to be on stool softeners for three months after. Stool softeners and perhaps laxatives even will be your best friends.   It's better to have someone with you, because walking, sitting etc was difficult for me. I needed help for a few days after. But if you can't afford it, and your friends can't help you, that's alright.   I say go for it. It helped me in the long run. Those three months of pain, then soreness were worth the five years of excruciating hemorrhoids. Still, every body is different. And pain tolerance wavers person to person. My screaming may be your \"well fuck, ow.\" or even less. I reiterate, I'm not a doctor, just someone who's gone through the procedure.",

    "\n\nHuman: My mom survived cancer and now in covid icu 51 year old cancer survivor with covid  Hey everyone, I don\u2019t even know how to start this but I just wanted to maybe get a little insight.   My mom was admitted to the hospital almost a month ago for low oxygen levels due to covid. She\u2019s 51 and was diagnosed with colorectal cancer this past August. The doctors successfully removed the cancer but she was still going to chemo to reduce her chances of it returning.   The covid has really attacked her lungs. She has been on the ventilator for about two weeks now maybe a little longer and the doctors have her on 100% oxygen. When she\u2019s in the prone position she can often get up to 95% oxygen but once they flip her it reaches to low 70s. She\u2019s currently on three sedation medications and sedated 100% they\u2019ve even had to paralyze her in order to see if it would help with her oxygen saturation but it isn\u2019t working. She is in need of a tracheostomy but in order for that to happen she must be able to be weaned off of the oxygen they\u2019re giving her to at least 60% but everytime they try to wean her she struggles to get air. Her lungs are stiff and she even had both of them collapse at one point.   We are trying to keep the faith the best we can but it\u2019s just so scary. Please if you can keep her in your prayers \u2665\ufe0f\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: I was given Epi on a plane yesterday and I\u2019ve been vomiting ever since 27F  I was on a 10 hour flight yesterday and went into anaphylactic shock (I think?). My whole body became itchy and covered in hives, and I couldn\u2019t breathe. My throat felt really tight and I was coughing really hard.  The plane itself didn\u2019t have epinephrine and neither did I (I don\u2019t have any known allergies where I\u2019d need to carry an epi pen) but a passenger did, it was 3 months out of date. They put it in my thigh and quite quickly I was breathing better. Also right before the epi I chewed two Benadryl because I couldn\u2019t swallow them (I\u2019m not sure if they work that way but I was panicking)   Anyways, after all that my heart started racing like crazy (which I guess is the epi) and I started violently vomiting, I spent a solid 4-5 hours just throwing up constantly.   It\u2019s the next day now and I\u2019m still so so nauseous and every time I drink or eat anything I throw up.   Could this be from the expired epi? Or maybe chewing pills?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Wife had a brain aneurysm during surgery. Chances of survival and other questions. Age: 32 Sex: female Height: 5\u20192  Weight: 120 lb prior to pregnancy, unsure during pregnancy (was 33 weeks pregnant) Race: Caucasian Duration of complaint: history of 8 years but current complaint since the 27th of May Location (Geographic and on body): Hawaii, brain Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): had a stroke eight years ago and a small clot treated 3 years ago Current medications (if any): a seizure medication and a beta blocker (unsure of names)  Include a photo if relevant (skin condition for example)  Hello, it was suggested that I post here seeking a possible second opinion about my wife\u2019s condition.  8 years ago when we were first married she suffered a stroke but made a complete recovery but was treated with a seizure medication and a beta blocker to prevent complications. She later had a small blood clot removed from her brain surgically with no complications 3 years ago.   On the 25th of May when she was 33 weeks pregnant with our fourth child, she began experiencing symptoms that were similar to those of her first stroke with intense headache, numbness and had a small seizure. I took her to the emergency department and it was determined that she had a blood clot that needed to be operated on and that they needed to deliver the baby. They delivered the baby and transferred my wife to a different hospital where her clot could be surgically treated. The day before surgery she seemed normal. She was complaining of pain and numbness but seemed like herself still. She was smiling, making jokes and ordering me to go back to be with our baby rather than stay with her. On the 27th of May she underwent the surgery. During the surgery the aneurysm ruptured. It was a lot bigger than they previously thought.  Currently, my wife is in ICU on life support. Her doctors say that most likely she won\u2019t survive and that if she does the effects will be devastating and she won\u2019t be the same.   The chances of her surviving her first stroke were only 40% and the chances of having almost no side effects were less than 1% and she came through. She came through the second surgery with ease too. I guess what I\u2019m asking is if there\u2019s a chance that this could be wrong or that her brain could heal itself. I saw the MRI and I understand how serious it is, a large portion of her brain was decimated by the rupture, but I want to know if there\u2019s any chance at all that she could recover from this. Can the brain heal itself from an aneurysm? I\u2019m not ready to say goodbye to her. She\u2019s so young and our kids are all under 7.\n\nAssistant:": {

If you can see what is obstructing the airway, lay the person down, arms to the sides, and sweep it out with a finger. First response should be the Heimlich maneuver.   To do this place your hands around the person in a ball shape at the stomach. When you push into their stomach, be sure to move the direction of your fist in a curved upward motion. If the person is too large that you cannot reach around properly, do this same motion at the chest. The same should be done if the person is pregnant.   If they become unresponsive, unable to breathe or unable to breathe normally, perform CPR. Go to their side, check their pulse at the neck on your side, if no pulse is found within 10 seconds, begin CPR immediately.   To perform CPR correctly, place your hands, one on top of each other, on the breastbone. Square yourself over the body, use the heel of your hand to press down 2\u201d for any person over 8 years old. Try to keep the most even rhythms possible, repeating compressions at a pace of 100 to 120 per minute. Make sure the chest rises back up before pressing back down.   If the person is an infant, cradle them on your forearm facedown, use the hand to support the head and a leg hanging to each side of your forearm. Have the head slightly lower than the rest of the body. Deliver five back blows to the infant using the heel of your hand in the upper back area between the shoulder blades. If the infant doesn\u2019t spit out the obstruction, sandwich your other hand over the child and flip. Perform chest thrusts between the nipples with two fingers. Only go 1.5\u201d deep for an infant. Make sure the chest rises back up before pressing back down. Do five thrusts before flipping back over for back blows.

If you can see what is obstructing the airway, lay the person down, arms to the sides, and sweep it out with a finger. First response should be the Heimlich maneuver.   To do this place your hands around the person in a ball shape at the stomach. When you push into their stomach, be sure to move the direction of your fist in a curved upward motion. If the person is too large that you cannot reach around properly, do this same motion at the chest. The same should be done if the person is pregnant.   If they become unresponsive, unable to breathe or unable to breathe normally, perform CPR. Go to their side, check their pulse at the neck on your side, if no pulse is found within 10 seconds, begin CPR immediately.   To perform CPR correctly, place your hands, one on top of each other, on the breastbone. Square yourself over the body, use the heel of your hand to press down 2\u201d for any person over 8 years old. Try to keep the most even rhythms possible, repeating compressions at a pace of 100 to 120 per minute. Make sure the chest rises back up before pressing back down.   If the person is an infant, cradle them on your forearm facedown, use the hand to support the head and a leg hanging to each side of your forearm. Have the head slightly lower than the rest of the body. Deliver five back blows to the infant using the heel of your hand in the upper back area between the shoulder blades.

Little do they know I work zero overtime, earn way more vacation and sick, I have a union that bargains to make sure my wages are good, and I leave my cell phone off on the weekends. Am I not earning my max potential salary wise? Yep, that\u2019s true. Am I earning it in retirement funds instead and great benefits? Absolutely. I don\u2019t regret it one single bit.

    "\n\nHuman: How to design a holed pipe so that fluid exits each hole equally? Hello,  I'm a hobbyist and have been trying to come up with something mostly silly lately, which despite believing at first that it'd be easy... was not quite so easy.      To elaborate,  Imagine a Pipe, now due to the fact that I can 3D Print this project it doesn't have to be a regular pipe. It can be square, and can even have inside features of basically any complexity. Along the bottom of the pipe are holes that are spaced linearly and straight from one end of the pipe to the other. I started out by spacing them out evenly but eventually came to the conclusion that the spacing might need to be different between each hole.   With this pipe in mind, basically like that of a green house watering system, how to best design the inside of the pipe and the distance between the pipe, or even the diameter of the holes, such that when inputting liquid ( such as water ) through it, that it flows evenly through each and every hole? Obviously in the case of a Greenhouse watering system, the water is generally shot through it with quite a pressure, so despite the pipe design being very simple there, it reaches all the holes. However if liquid were not to flow at high pressure, it would simply take the path of least resistance which usually would be the first hole.  I've tried to come up with some ideas of how to make the path of least resistance be the furthest back by adding complex channels within the pipe, but to no avail. So I was wondering... surely there is already something akin to this out there?  I've been looking for similar designs for a while now but to no avail. So I was hoping to maybe find an answer here.  As for the reason of this project? Nothing particular, I was just randomly interested in fluid oriented design and wanted to try and see how fluid behaves within a pipe and tried to make fluids of different viscosities and with varying pressure leave the above described pipe's holes evenly.   &#x200B;  Thank you for your time.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: What type of silicone would be best for a masturbation cup? Porous vs Softness Hi, kinda of odd but I want to independently create a fleshlight type sex toy. I have a ton of questions, and those \u201cask an expert\u201d websites seem to be dead so here I am.   TLDR;;; looking to create or find a non porous, non toxic soft material for a fleshlight. I don\u2019t understand what makes up \u202asilicone and how to learn more.    OK so from the information I\u2019ve read, the less porous the material is the softer it is, but non porous means it can be cleaned properly/no bacteria growth.\u202c So obviously I\u2019m looking for a material that is low on the shore a hardness scale but is still non porous. Phthalate is apparently bad because that is the cause of chemical burns with sex toys, but this is what would make the silicone soft?   I don\u2019t know which compounds that make up silicone that influence porosity, softness, heat retention and elasticity, durability etc etc. How does the curing method effect the silicone? I don\u2019t understand what it is I need to create a silicone soft enough for a masturbator cup. Is \u201cmedical grade\u201d and \u201cfood grade\u201d silicones just that because the structure of them is less porous? Could the same type of silicone that breast implants use work - and how would I even know how to convey the exact type of silicone formula I want to a factory? I assume the harder silicon that holds the liquid of a breast implant could be used as a coat layer in a masturbation cup, over a softer silicone material that would be toxic with direct contact. What\u2019s the formula of breast implants silicone? How would I learn if it would would be durable enough to hold, and not deteriorate when constantly rubbed? How would a know how durable a type of rubber would be if thinly spread?  But then I see there\u2019s other options like TPE/TPR. It has a low durometer, and the lower the durometer the softer the material...how is this different from the shore scale? I read \u201cTPE is generally considered body safe\u201d - generally, so not always? How can I learn what kinds of silicone are \u201cmedical grade\u201d or are platinum cured and how do they differ? How would I be able to communicate this to a factory and check if it\u2019s \u201cgood quality\u201d?  I have a lot of questions and idk how to find answers to any of this, Google isn\u2019t exactly giving me answers that are referenced from real sources so I\u2019m just ????? I could use what\u2019s already been used for sex toys, but I want to understand if I can make my own product better.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " So i can actually answer this! I worked for 4 years at an elastomer compounder and 1.5 years at a mold shop.  We had two products that were actually used for sex toys (both dildos and both produced outside the US).   Regarding material, I would use LSR (liquid silicone rubber), hands down. This can be injection molded with low cycle time and very consistent shrink/dimensions, as there is no cure step. Most LSR manufacturers will already have a grade that already has USP class VI certification.  The problem with TPE is that its chemical resistance is generally good, but there are not that many TPE manufacturers who go through class VI certification. TPE is resistant to most common chemicals and is about 1/5th the cost of LSR. You are looking at $1-2/lb for a TPE vs $6-8 for LSR. If you want to do your own exposure/extraction testing of TPE vs certain bodily fluids,  go for it!  As for porosity, I'm not sure how you would make/want a porous molded cup? Sounds like a huge pain.  You are asking a lot of good questions, and the best way to have them answered is to go to a LSR or TPE manufacturer, throw a higher order volume in their face (truckload orders or more), and hop on a phone call with them. They already sell product to this same application so they can guide you to the grade that works best.",

    "\n\nHuman: My mechanical engineering career is not going in the direction I want and I\u2019m at a loss for how to fix it. Long story short, like probably everyone else, I always really wanted to go into design or R&D. 6 years of experience later, I\u2019ve had one \u201cdesign\u201d job that was a glorified drafting job that lasted about 3 years. The other years were spent in roles that did not at all turn out to be what I thought they were going to be. A mix of pure paperwork and manufacturing-esque work, things I have zero interest in.   I was laid off because of covid last year and I\u2019ve since spent a year unemployed, mostly out of my choosing because I was so burnt out, depressed, and disillusioned with engineering. I\u2019ve gotten an offer to return to the last place I worked (different group) but again doing something I do not want to do at all. The company bait and switched me. Job description sounded amazing and exactly like what I wanted but then when I was asking the managers about the work itself, it was immediately clear it did not match the description at all. It\u2019s again more manufacturing bullshit I don\u2019t want to touch with a 10ft pole.   I\u2019m out of unemployment at this point but I still have quite a bit of savings so I don\u2019t *really* the need job quite yet but obviously income and benefits would be nice. I\u2019m just terrified what might happen to my mental health walking back into an environment I know I\u2019m not going to like.   At this point, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m qualified for the jobs I want. I don\u2019t hear anything back from applications to design roles and I stumble hard in interviews when asked about things I\u2019ve designed. I don\u2019t have any good experience to fall back on in that area. I\u2019ve considered grad school off and on for years but I don\u2019t think I can swing essentially having no income for at least 2 years in a masters program.   I apologize for how whiny this post sounds. I\u2019m just at my wits end trying to figure out ways of putting the train back on the tracks. I\u2019ve even thought about leaving engineering entirely too. That\u2019s how little desire to work in anything manufacturing I have. I have several friends pushing me towards software engineering but god that\u2019s a daunting task lol.   If I wanted to keep pushing for a true design role, is there anything I could be doing in my free time to make my resume more appealing? I\u2019ve found some interesting courses online but I question how much employers really care about that sort of thing. Personal projects don\u2019t seem as relevant in traditional engineering like they are in software. Should I be applying to entry level design roles?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " You mentioned personal projects. Hellz yes! If you don't have an online portfolio already, make one. Just a free WordPress site will do the trick, and toss a little summary up with pics for any school/ work/ hobby things you've done that might be relevant to engineering (not confidential stuff obvs). It'll set you apart from other applicants in a really good way - being able to pull up a video of something I've actually made has landed me real engineering jobs.   And then do more projects and post em online! Even just one stupid little one-day project is a start. If you want to be a designer, follow some cad tutorials on YouTube and post pics of what you've made on your online portfolio. R&D? Make an Arduino project. Document some home renos. Idk. It's all good.    Other advice: Check out the book \"making work work for the highly sensitive person\", by Barrie Jaeger. Some of it sounds fluffy, but it does offer a model for viewing work that resonates intensely with some people, and from your mix of aspiration and exhaustion I suspect you might find some value in it.

    "\n\nHuman: How do you deal with Tribal knowledge? Recently interviewed with a launch company that had recently had a mass exodus of people and are in a huge hiring frenzy atm. Thankfully got moved onto the panel interview but there was one question that really stumped me during the interview. The interviewer asked \u201clets say a bunch of people decided to leave the company but there was an overwhelming amount of tribal knowledge that left with them and now were forced to build these rockets without their expertise. How do you go about acquiring that tribal knowledge?\u201d   Didnt really know how to answer that because I felt like once an employee leaves a company they are no longer indebted to said company. I could only really answer from a perspective of preventing it in terms of documenting everything but not sure if there was a better answer and would love some insight.\n\nAssistant:": {

I\u2019m seriously considering jumping ship to the dark side of business/sales. At least the paperwork over there comes with an OTE bonus!  I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and what industry / role you have.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: How much MS Paint do you use at your job? Just curious.  Yes I know Visio, Lucidchart, etc. exist. They also cost money.  For myself, as a mechanical engineer, I occasionally do small interconnection diagrams for prototypes in Paint as well as occasional explainers (e.g. taking a screenshot from Solidworks and circling a feature and so on, or dirty sketches to explain ideas). I have also considered using it for cable drawings but ended up hand drawing and scanning those, and then feeding them into GIMP (which is more powerful than Paint but much worse at actually making lines and stuff)\n\nAssistant:": {

            " I'm quite certain you could transition into sales engineering if you find a company that will train you on the technical aspects of their product or service.   From experience, the worst true classical engineers go into sales engineering, because they're the less technically minded or maybe less analytical. That's not a bad thing, and I hope that didn't come off as too crude to those folks, but being an introvert I would really struggle in sales, and rather excel in analysis and problem solving so I stick to engineering. Just my experience so there's probably exceptions to my statement.  I think you could definitely do it if you grind a little, do some homework on your niche or category, and get your foot in the door should the opportunity arise. Probably no need for additional schooling, just some internal company training like I mentioned earlier.",

            " I read through this thread before commenting just so I would have an idea of where you're at.    Seems like you're most interested in going the coding route, but I can also offer an alternative: maybe start exploring the possibility of heading into the industrial engineering or logistics/supportability engineering space. Generally this field has a much lower barrier to entry since it doesn't take a specialized degree to make an Excel sheet to track work being done (which is what you might do to start out), and when you do start feeling confident in your skills there are many opportunities to stand out and cut your teeth by contributing large improvements to assembly processes and other stuff. Same deal with logistics - you can start out just doing basic analyses on failed parts, but as you get better you can start to do data science-y things like predictive failure modeling and using data (python) to help understand the root cause of failures in the first place. Many engineers who have 'broken into' tech companies get their start as traditional engineers doing exactly this kind of stuff as IE's or logistics engineers.    I say this working as a systems engineer in logistics with a very traditional AE degree background - many of my colleagues have degrees in statistics, economics, history, and other non-engineering backgrounds, and yet they manage to do just fine for themselves. Our group tends to actually hire a good mix of engineers and non engineers, and in my opinion it does boost the quality of work we deliver since the non engineers balance out the stupid 'ackchually' attitude a lot of engineers bring to the table, especially given we work a lot directly with the customer and need to be salesmen sometimes.    Just something to consider. Also, sorry for all the annoying gatekeeping you're seeing on this thread. Just physically painful to read through."

    "\n\nHuman: What happened to the robot craze of the 2000s? For those old enough to remember(and saying this about the 2000s makes me feel really old), there was tremendous excitement surrounding robotics during that period, much like AI today. Especially this thing was literally seen as the next step of advancement in humanity, and a lot of people were speculating that in 10-15 years of time(which is today), robotics would advance to a point where things like waiters would be made redundant, all facets of daily life and anything that requires physical input would be robotified and so on. Thoughts like this culminated in popsci movies like \"I, Robot\" and games like Crysis.  Yet some time after that, it lost all it's hype and we don't hear much about robots nowadays(except Boston Dynamics) and our waiters, garbage collectors, nurses, plumbers or electricians are nowhere to go, soldiers don't wear exoskeletons or fight side-by-side with android combat robots either.

I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ve messed it up. They keep taking to me like I\u2019m going to spend my entire career in this industry and that isn\u2019t at all what I wanted. This was meant to be just a start.   My director called me and said that people come into this through trade and they struggle to bring people in because there\u2019s no direct degree in it. People just come in from pure engineering backgrounds.   Have I made a mistake here?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Having PhD in Mech Eng or just a Masters? I\u2019m about to finish up my masters degree in Mech E and have been offered a PhD project for about an addition two-three years of school time.  Project is very interesting to me involving additive manufacturing and control systems type work.   My Question is how have other Engineers navigated the industry with a PhD or masters Degree and does it make a huge difference ?  I\u2019m currently torn on doing the PhD because I feel burnt out after 5-6 years of straight school with internships here and there in the summers.  No one is getting any younger and if I go through with the PhD I would have spent most of my twenties in school. Not saying it\u2019s a bad thing but I also believe there\u2019s more to life than school and grad student pay isn\u2019t exactly opening to many things outside of living a basic student lifestyle.   If this post needs to be posted somewhere else please let me know and I will do so.   TLDR:  how is navigating industry with a PhD and did you personally feel it was worth it the time spent?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Any engineers relevant to internet infrastructure... Do bloated websites and ad spam contribute to significant energy expenditure across the internet and user devices as a whole? If so how much is that relative to energy expenditure of the entire system? When I'm trying to find niche information I end up loading a lot of web pages that are unoptomized and or bloated. For example, I was just searching for 'automatic pizza box folder' and have to load a bunch of crappy news pages to look for relevant insights. This gets me wondering just how much extra total energy we spend transmitting a lot of unnecessary information through the system. I would think that loading an individual web page would require an incredibly small amount of energy, but when you scale that up to every individual browsing multiple pages across a large scale then I imagine that expenditure would be fairly impressive.  So what's the reality of the situation?  Is there much room left in internet operation and usage to save energy usage, or has it already been driven about as low as it can go?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: What does it mean for something to be \"wetter than water\" and what does that do to rust? TL:DR - Friend of a friend mentioned that rust might be removed from a surface because the chemicals the iron was in were \"wetter than water.\"  Full story - A while back I was helping a buddy swap out an engine on his truck, him and I are Mech E's, a buddy of his who is a Chem E was supervising and holding down the beer cooler.  I mentioned a carburetor cleaner that I liked, and one of the reasons I liked it was that it would remove rust without being overly harsh like an acid.  \"Oh, that's cool, I wonder why it does that.\"  \"Hell if I know, man.  Not my farm, not my pig.\"  :both of us look at Chem E expectantly, then repeat the general train of thought when it was obvious he was fucking off on his phone:  \"I dunno, what was the product again?\"  I tell him, he looks it up and reads through the SDS for the product.   \"I'm not sure, I don't see anything obvious in here.  Several surfactants, a couple things that like to bind to water and/or oils.  Its possible that the chemical combo is wetter than water and that may help break down the rust?\"  My friend and I stare at him blankly and just kinda go \"huh, neat.\" and get back to work.  ~~  ~~  ~~  ~~    I went looking for info and quickly remembered why I was a Mech E, so I thought I'd ask here.  Does that make any sense to any of you guys? Or was he just blowing smoke?  Product is Berryman Chem Dip Carb Cleaner.\n\nAssistant:": {

The stereotype of engineers that we're pretty shit at social situations, and it isn't ALWAYS unfounded.   That being said, there could be a small degree of truth in the grey. A surfactant would reduce surface tension and make removing oils from a surface easier. From what I've seen a number of chemical rust strippers (for steel) basically have a weak acid or other water soluble compound react with the rust either to dissolve it into the solution or to make it react more readily with a secondary compound that'll yeet it into the solution. A degreaser would remove the oil from the surface and potentially make it easier for those chemicals to contact the surface.   But yeah, wetter then water is still nonsense speak.",

            " Ok, so let me say, the history of the tattoo, while explored in various contexts \u2013 especially non-European ones apparently \u2013 hasn't been really well explored for Nazi Germany. However, what little scholarship there is, suggest something that is not very surprising: The Nazis weren't fans of tattoos except those that fulfilled a clear functionality like the SS blood type tattoos or the camp tattoos.  It seems there have been at least local laws in Germany heavily regulating tattoos or more specifically the public showing of tattoos since before the Nazis. The literature often mentions a 1911 prohibition of \"fully tattooed women in public\" though I could not verify if that was a local or national law. What little information there is, seems to suggest that it was local since there is at least one case of a woman in Berlin being escorted out of a bar because of her tattoos. That was Maria Finke, wife of Kuddi Finke, one of Germany's first prominent tattoo artists, who had tattooed his wife on her whole body.  Throughout the 1920s both tattooing as well as showing tattoos (a source of income for circus performers of the \"freak show\" variety) seems to have become more and more regulated in Germany. The most famous example of this is the Bracht'sche Erlass (Bracht's Decree) of 1932 in Prussia. Franz Bracht was the vice-Reichcommissar and commissar of the interior in Prussia after chancellor von Papen had effectively dissolved the SPD lead Prussian government in the so-called Preussenschlag and transferred its powers to the Reich government.  Bracht did many things during his time, both as vice commissar and later minister of the interior under Schleicher but one of them was to completely outlaw the showing of tattoos in public; a practice adopted shortly after in all of Germany, meaning that no one could show their tattoos in public and people could especially not earn a living from that.  This practice continued under the Nazis. Stephan Oettermann, a German cultural historian, mentions in his book *Zeichen auf der Haut. Die Geschichte der T\u00e4towierung in Europa.* (Signs on Skin. A History of Tattoos in Europe) that the Nazis indeed outlawed both showing tattoos in public as well as tattooing itself and that having a tattoo was reason enough to get a person arrested and send to a concentration camp. While I couldn't wholly verify this information (the footnote Oettermann gives is a German book from the 70s I do not have access to atm), I could verify that in 1938 when the police initiated the \"Aktion Arbeitsscheu Reich\" (Action Work Shy Reich) during which people whom the Nazis called \"asocial\" were arrested in large numbers, one directive for the police about who to arrest reads:  > The police has to take action against all forms of showmanship, especially the kind that violates the healthy people's feelings (gesundes volksempfinden). This includes but is not is not limited to showmen of abnormal body (fish men, bird men, animal men and so forth but also tattoos. (...) If bodily health of those individuals allows they are to be brought to a mental facility.  Furthermore, what I could also verify is the fact that several well-known German tattoo artists were imprisoned in concentration camps, namely Wilhelm \"Willi\" E. Blumberg and Albert Heinze, two of the first professional tattoo artists in Germany. They too were swept up in \"anti-social\" actions though it is likely that the Nazis saw additional reasons to them being tattooed for such an action.  Traditionally, tattoos at that point in time were associated with either people whom the Nazis deemed anti-social or criminal (like actual criminals as well as people of low socio-economomic stratas) and sailors but on the latter group I could unfortunately not find much pertinent information.  Two exceptions were apparently made where tattoos fulfilled a practical function: Waffen-SS soldiers had bloodgroup tattoos and, of course, Auschwitz prisoners had their numbers tattooed. With Waffen-SS soldiers little information survives on how this practice started but the function was pretty obvious: To make medical aid easier. Oettermann tells of SS officers getting other tattoos as well but again, this is information I could not verify.   In the camps, the practice started once in 1941 some camps and in particular Auschwitz had a large influx of former Soviet POWs. Originally, the prisoner numbers were sewn into clothing but when the appeareance of these groups lead to a lack of clothing, the practice of tattooing them started. This method was only applied in Auschwitz though while other camps issued badges.  All in all, the Nazis most likely associated with tattoos with so-called \"asocials\" and took active steps to persecute tattoo artists and those who earned a living through showing their tattoos. It is a likely guess that people with tattoos were not regarded too highly by them.  Sources:  * Stephan Oettermann: Zeichen auf der Haut.

    "\n\nHuman: Ancient Apocalypse: is there any reputable support for Ice Age civilizations? Netflix just dropped Ancient Apocalypse, where a journalist goes around the world in a scuba suit to try and prove that there were civilizations around during the last Ice Age. His main point is that Atlantis was around during the Ice Age and submerged when the sea levels rose\u2026 and then they spread civilization everywhere so it gets into some weirder territory. The scuba journalist shows a bunch of clips from his interview on Joe Rogan, so obviously I\u2019m taking all of this in with a critical lens. He\u2019s got some great footage though and crafting some believable narratives, so I started googling. I haven\u2019t found anything about it on any reputable sites. I\u2019m guessing my Atlantis dreams are dashed but I wanted to see if the good people here can shed any light on the likelihood that the hominids around during the last Ice Age were more advanced than hunter gatherers.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " I'm not in a position to provide you with a comprehensive answer to your actual question; however, I thought that some more context for the show might be valuable.  The \"star\" of the documentary is Graham Hancock who has been writing about an 'alternative' history of human civilization since the 90s. Most notably, his book \"Fingerprints of the Gods\" put forward the hypothesis that there was a civilization on earth that predated our own recorded history by about 10,000 years. The primary source of evidence for the time-frame came from a theory put forward by another author Robert Bauval in a book called the \"Orion Mystery\" that posited the pyramids of Giza were built to mimic the position of the stars in Orion's belt.  There is a complicated argument involving Ancient Egyptian religion, the shafts in the Great Pyramid and the precession of the stars over millennia that leads to the conclusion that the design of the Egyptian monuments were intended to mark a specific period of time, approximately 13,000 years ago.  Taken at face value, it makes for a compelling story, but even Bauval himself admitted in a later book, that he had to fudge some things to make it all work out (while still clinging to the theory).  Hancock's book has a laundry list of other pieces of 'evidence' that amount to unrelated 'mysteries' or oddities from around the world often drawn from other works. Notably, those other works are exclusively popular publications not scientific ones.  Hancock eventually settles on the 'Atlantis' myth as being the pre-existing civilization; however, while the common understanding of Atlantis is an island that was in the Mediterranean, he draws his theory of Atlantis from a theory put forward by Rand and Rose Flem-ath in a 1995 book called \"When the Sky Fell: In Search of Atlantis\".  The Flem-ath's believed that the historical Atlantis was not an island in the Mediterranean but rather the continent of Antarctica, in part based on the work of Charles Hapgood, a keen Atlantis researcher. There was evidence at the time from core-samples that Antarctica used to have a temperate climate (which has been since well established: cf. this article for example) and that supported Charles Hapgood's Theory of Earth Crust Displacement published in his 1958 book \"The Earth's Shifting Crust\" (which included a supporting forward by Albert Einstein) and which he and the Flem-Ath's accounted for Antarctica/Atlantis's shift to the pole as well as the myth of its disappearance.  The time period in which Hapgood believed Antarctica still had a temperate climate roughly coincides with the time frame that Bauval and Hancock pinned the the existence of their antediluvian civilization; that however, has been disproven (for example: Ingolfsson, O. (2004) Quaternary glacial and climate history of Antarctica.)  All of these authors, Hapgood, the Flem-Aths, Bauval and Hancock have assembled a compelling story that certainly captures the imagination\u2014allusions to their theories show up in popular culture, for example in the 'Stargate' franchise. And although, superficially it appears that they have scientific evidence to support their claims much of that evidence doesn't hold up to scrutiny or more often, is only used to insinuate a conclusion rather than support it. Their work certainly does not constitute anything like scientific rigor and it shouldn't be considered anything more generous than a fun thought experiment. You do not need to dig very deeply before you find their connections to and inspiration from the likes of occult writer Colin Wilson and out-right fraudster Erich von D\u00e4niken who have made outlandish claims concerning ancient civilizations.  Hancock, in particular, as one of the most well-known of proponents of this grand theory of the existence of a prehistorical civilization, has a very poor reputation amongst scientists and historians. He's also notable for his laughable (and disproven) claims about the 'face on Mars' and its supposed connection to the Sphinx.",

            " Having not yet watched the series, I cannot directly comment on any details presented; if there are any specific things you have questions about, please do ask! Folks who have watched it say it's more or less (and somteimes word for word) an adaptation of two of Hancock's books, which I have read most of. Others have already pointed out how ridiculously unoriginal Hancock is, and the wonderful irony of him talking crap about archaeologists constantly because Gobleki Tepe doesn't fir their theories when the site was excavated by... mainstream archaeologists. I will add to this with an edited version of an older post on Hancock, that links to even more posts on Hancock.  ____  There's a handful of fundamental scientific concepts that I teach at the start of any archaeology or biological anthropology classes.  The first is how to make a convincing scientific conclusion. SupposeI told you there was a teapot circling the sun somewhere between Earth's and Mars's orbits. It's too small to be seen by a telescope, and no records exist of anyone putting it there. Should I expect you to believe me? Are you a fool for not believing me? Of course not. Philosopher Bertrand Russell first used this analogy to support his own atheism, but it applies to any scientific statement. The burden of proof lies on the claimant, and you can't expect people to buy a hypothesis that states its own unverifiability.  The second is the importance of context: no data point is significant on its own. It says nothing about the effectiveness of a drug if everyone who takes it has reduced flu symptoms in 48 hours if everyone else with the flu has reduced symptoms over the same time. Likewise, no single artifact can tell us much about anything. Where was it found? What was it next to? Are there lots of similar things? How similar is it to those things? Scientific conclusions must be made in the context of an entire data set.  Graham Hancock's writings disregard these concepts entirely. This is why people use the word \"psuedoscience.\" It's not because any of his claims are bonkers- \"bonkers\" is relative after all- it's because he doesn't actually do any science but attempts to make scientific sounding claims.  Hancock's first books (e.g. *Fingerprints of the Gods*) trick readers by violating that second point. I've offered an in-depth critique of his chapter on Tiwanaku here, which outlines the evasive, sneaky rhetorical techniques Hancock uses to convince readers. (And the lies. So many lies.) The basic formula is:  * Hancock describes something cool in vague, romanticized terms. This is often done in the first person in a journalistic style to provide an air of legitimacy without needing to be thorough  * Hancock asserts the thing's mysterious nature. He does this actively by showing how things archaeologists said 100 years ago (or never said at all!) fail to explain the thing, or passively by ignoring decades of research, positioning himself as the first person to ask these questions.  * Hancock offers an additional, enticing observation that, having had all other context stripped away, functions as the single knowable fact  * Hancock suggests his kooky hyper-diffusionist explanation for that observation that only makes sense if the handful of observations he's provided are the only ones you know  Because Hancock has stripped away all context for his observations, he can make whatever claims he wants. And because most readers have no familiarity with archaeological literature outside their high school history books, they don't know how much information Hancock is not telling them. Archaeological claims are like puzzles: they are built of hundreds of little interlocking bits that might not include every detail when but still point to a cohesive picture when taken together. Hancock is the dude in the corner yelling that the whole puzzle must be wrong because the two pieces he pulled out of the box don't fit together. Maybe if he looked at the big picture he might find a place to put them, but he doesn't want that; he just wants your attention.  More recently, Hancock has shifted to theories that violate that first scientific fundamental. His book *America Before* is the culmination of his obsession with the Younger Dryas Impact Theory. He also popularized the theory on Joe Rogan's show, which I address here. The YDI was a supposed comet impact that caused drastic climactic changes and general environmental destruction at the end of the last Ice Age. Hancock had said for years that all his theories needed was a mechanism to destroy his ancient mega-civilizations. His first books claim that seismic activity buried a civilization under Antarctica. But once some evidence for the YDI as a cause for the Younger Dryas fluctuations was published, he quickly latched onto the idea, and suddenly this ancient progenitor civilization was in North America, buried under a comet.  *America Before* spends most of its time on how this event would have wiped clean ancient advanced civilizations in the Americas.  But here's the thing. We've known since the start of the 20th-century that there was some wacky climate stuff going on at the end of the Ice Age. We've also known that there was significant environmental disruption, including widespread forest fires and sea level change. The YDI is a theory to explain those observations. Why did Hancock not pick up on it before? In all likelihood, because a meteor impact sounds a lot more likely to have destroyed as much as Hancock needed to be destroyed than \"climate fluctuations.\"  All Hancock's talk of ancient advanced civs whose evidence was destroyed by a meteor is classic Russell's teapot. He wants you to believe there was something there, but has embedded in his hypothesis a mechanism by which the evidence for that thing was destroyed.  Yet, this is another level beyond a teapot. A global civilization of the type Hancock speaks would have left *enormous* amounts of evidence. At the very least: mines and quarries, expanses of agriculture, tools and tools and tools, genetic evidence in domesticated species, and cities. This isn't just a teapot in space, it's a teapot that's blasting radio signals. Hancock must believe this entire civilization existed exclusively along the now-submerged coasts where the archaeological record is inaccessible or irreparably distorted.  I go on a much longer rant about the logic at play here. To summarize that comment, Hancock loves to make a big deal out of disproving statements that were made with a fraction of the data we have now by asserting them as inherently true despite them being the result of inductive reasoning. \"People building monumental architecture used ceramics\" is, for instance, a claim arrived at in the early days of archaeology with a narrow survey of sites informed primarily by Eurocentric theory. It is not simply a common sense claim, and is as viable for critique as any other. Hancock would have you believe this \"obviously true\" statement is so enshrined in the way human societies work that any evidence against it as a radical revision of mainstream thought. ___  One can debate endlessly over whether Hancock's claims are provocative, ludicrous, nonsense, fun, dangerous, racist, novel, radical, dull, or any other number of adjectives. But that, I believe, is missing the point. If you're talking about the claims, Hancock has already won the best prize you could concede: a place on the stage of reasonable debate. His claims come from such a pathetic imitation of the scientific process that to evaluate them as statements of truth is pointless.  The more you look at Hancock's works, the more you see a guy doing their darnedest not really to argue that there was an Ancient Apocalypse, but to convince you that everything is mysterious, that archaeologists have never really done much research ever. He rarely discusses, rarely elaborates, rarely builds an argument; he jumps from \"there's an unexcavated building at this site\" to \"archaeologists are entirely wrong about the site\" without so much as a \"because.\" His writing style is all about dropping a detail here and another there, moving on before you have time to question anything. The chapters in his book don't end with summaries, but with: \"I don\u2019t know what to make of these similarities\" (that's an actual quote, he literally says that in *Magicians*). There is simply no attempt to use multiple lines of evidence, no attempt to point you to further reading outside things he himself wrote. Looking at the notes for the chapter on South America in *Magicians*, we see lots of self-citations, lots of travel blogs and news articles, lots of books he wrote the intro for, and lots of general audience texts from before 1960. He only cites the archaeologists he apparently has so much beef with in regards to a single throwaway line about the Amazon.   This is particularly egregious if you watch his Joe Rogan appearances. Note just how much time he spends actually making falsifiable claims versus how much time he spends whining about establishment orthodoxy. And while you're at it, note how many times he calls out any specific archaeologists. He really doesn't, and one can only imagine it's because he either doesn't know them or he doesn't want you looking it up to find out how much information is actually out there. He keeps his enemies vague and ill-defined so you can't argue against him. If he can get you to buy into this all, it doesn't really matter what outrageous claim follows.",

    "\n\nHuman: Historically and linguistically, what makes people categorize British/French/etc. accents as \"sexy\" and Asian/Indian accents as \"unattractive?\" When in American history did this attitude develop? I have read extensively about the demonization and emasculation of Asian men in Hollywood history from Sessue Hayakawa onwards, and am aware that (for example) anti-Japanese sentiment fueled general anti-Asian backlash in America during that era.  However, being an Asian American male, I still find Asian accents unattractive - in general the morphemes sound more \"crass\" and \"rough,\" almost comical, as opposed to British/French accents which sound polished or aristocratic. Speaking purely empirically, I've heard people say \"wow that British accent is so hot\" but never the same for Chinese accents.  I'm curious whether this is ONLY a function of trained historical associations that have been implanted in our culture, or if the human ear possesses a natural \"liking\" for certain phonetic structures and will classify those sounds as \"auditorily pleasing\" while \"disliking\" other phonetic combinations. In other words, if Asians hadn't been demonized in American culture, would we still naturally find Asian accents unattractive (a la the bouba/kiki effect where certain sounds are automatically mapped to round or sharp shapes - maybe a similar mapping exists for \"pleasing\" vs \"unpleasing\" accents?)  I realize this question strays into linguistic analysis as well as historical, so if there is a primarily historical answer about the association of Asian accents with unattractiveness, please feel free to provide those, specifically in relation to Asian history in America.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Ah. Well. From the graveyard of removed comments I think we can surmise that even a good 31 years after the end of Reagan's presidency, and more than 16 years after his death, his Presidency produces *feelings*, both strongly positive and negative.   Anyway, if we dive into the results linked to on the Wkipedia page,  we can tease out some possible answers to your question. First, we're discounting the popular surveys - the fact that JFK, Bill Clinton and Reagan tend to rank the highest in those surveys makes me believe that a lot of the polled Americans associate nostalgia with Presidential administrations, and that's a whole different field to cover.  So focusing on the scholar surveys and the scores as linked, first we should note one very curious thing - of the sixteen total sources listed, the first five very solidly place Reagan in the middling range, mostly being in the third quartile. It's only around 2000 that Reagan marches up to the top ranks. So for a good decade or so after Reagan's presidency, his legacy was considered by historians to be extremely ambivalent.  Now, to focus on the 21st century sources, I'm very much drawn to the Sierra College Research Institute and C-SPAN in particular, because unlike the others, which seem to be mostly asking historians \"give this president a score, and we'll tally all the figures up\", these two surveys both were conducted a number of times, and breakdown the scores for each president into sub-categories, so we are able to see in which areas historians think a President's administration was good, middling and poor.   The most recent Sierra College data is here, for those who are interested, and the most recent C-SPAN data is here.  Now we see some further curious things. Starting with the C-SPAN data, Reagan's highest scores are \"Public Persuasion\" (90.9), \"Vision/Setting an Agenda\" (84.9), and \"International Relations\" (76.8). His three lowest scores are \"Pursued Equal Justice for All\" (44.6), \"Administrative Skills\" (47.4), and \"Economic Management\" (60.9 - this actually puts him 16th and in between John Adams and John Quincy Adams). So interestingly, even though this survey overall ranks Reagan as 9th, it's with his administration itself being considered not well run, being very unequal in its domestic impacts, and having OK-but-not-amazing economic returns.  Now let's look at Sierra College (Reagan score: 13th), which has a frankly dizzying data set with overall scores, overall sub-scores in \"Attributes\", \"Abilities\" and \"Accomplishments\", and then *sub-sub-scores* within those fields. Now we are *really* drilling down into data. All his scores are relatively high (nothing in Buchanan or Andrew Johnson territory), but some are middling. His lowest scores are \"Intelligence\" (31), \"Background\" (27), \"Integrity\" (24), and \"Executive Appointments\" (20). In the middle are \"Court Appointments\" (18), \"Handling of US Economy\" (18), and \"Domestic Accomplishments\" (16), and his highest scores are \"Leadership Ability\" (7), \"Relationship with Congress\" (6), \"Party Leadership\" (4), and most notably \"Luck\"(3).  Honestly the Sierra College rankings feel almost like damning Reagan with faint praise. He comes off as relatively unimaginative, and with an OK-but-not-great domestic record, but outstanding scores on vision, communication and above all luck.   I think there's something to this. There is a lot to be said for Reagan being \"the Great Communicator\", who more or less realigned US politics with his election, and steered the Republican Party towards a form of ideological conservatism (beating out the party's older, more moderate and Northeastern wing, best personified by George H.W. Bush), and on top of that was able to win away \"Reagan Democrats\" in his two election victories, although it's worth noting that this didn't necessarily translate into Republican victories further down the slate: the House of Representatives kept its Democratic majority from 1955 to 1995, despite Reagan's electoral success, and despite his 1980 victory helping to flip the Senate to a Republican majority in 1981 (for the first time since 1955), it reverted to a Democratic majority in 1987. Reagan did have a knack for boiling complicated ideas down into simple phrases that he could deliver with aplomb, in no small part because of his acting background (\"There you go again\", \"Trust But Verify\", \"A Recession is when your neighbor loses a job, a depression is when you lose your job, and recovery is when President Carter loses his\").   But I want to focus a bit on that highest score in particular: in a lot of ways, Reagan was a *lucky* president. Deregulation was started in the 1970s, and busting inflation was initiated by Fed Chairman Paul Volcker in 1979, but the actual economic benefits accrued under Reagan's presidency. Even anti-inflationary policies (in part spurred by the Fed trying to raise interest rates to fight the danger of inflation caused in no small part by Reagan's deficit spending) caused a severe and long-lasting downturn from July 1981 to November 1982 that saw unemployment rise to its highest levels since the Great Depression, and Reagan's approval ratings sink. It's by some luck, however, that this cleared up and the economy began growing before the 1984 elections (in reverse, George H.W. Bush had the *highest approval ratings ever* in 1991, but the following recession in 1992 destroyed those ratings and helped in his electoral defeat that year). Reagan was also lucky that his aggressive stance towards the Soviet Union in 1981-1983 didn't unintentionally ignite World War III, especially during the 1983 Able Archer exercises that the Soviet leadership feared was a cover for an actual first strike. He's lucky that his Soviet counterpart from 1985 on was Mikhail Gorbachev, who was genuinely interested in de-escalation of Cold War tensions, and built a successful diplomatic relationship with Reagan - and also unilaterally did much of the work, despite what myths of \"Reagan winning the Cold War\" or \"Reagan defeating Communism\" might say. He's lucky that the Iran-Contra Affair wasn't presidency-ending, which it could have been (I suspect the low marks for \"Integrity\", \"Intelligence\" and \"Administrative Skills\" come in here...the best that could be argued in Reagan's defense during the scandal is that he had no idea what multiple people in his administration were doing in terms of violating the law), and that it occurred relatively late in his administration. He was lucky that the biggest daily stock market crash in US history (\"Black Monday\"), didn't have knock-on effects in the \"real\" economy, and that the Savings and Loan crisis that *did* impact the US economy negatively didn't really have knock-on effects until after Reagan left office.   Maybe there's a bigger lesson here - a lot of presidents tend to be lucky, or unlucky, as there are many, many contingencies that occur during their time in office that they may or may not actually be responsible for. But it happens on their watch, so they tend to either get the credit - or the blame.",

        ],
        "sft_target": " Ah. Well. From the graveyard of removed comments I think we can surmise that even a good 31 years after the end of Reagan's presidency, and more than 16 years after his death, his Presidency produces *feelings*, both strongly positive and negative.   Anyway, if we dive into the results linked to on the Wkipedia page,  we can tease out some possible answers to your question. First, we're discounting the popular surveys - the fact that JFK, Bill Clinton and Reagan tend to rank the highest in those surveys makes me believe that a lot of the polled Americans associate nostalgia with Presidential administrations, and that's a whole different field to cover.  So focusing on the scholar surveys and the scores as linked, first we should note one very curious thing - of the sixteen total sources listed, the first five very solidly place Reagan in the middling range, mostly being in the third quartile. It's only around 2000 that Reagan marches up to the top ranks. So for a good decade or so after Reagan's presidency, his legacy was considered by historians to be extremely ambivalent.  Now, to focus on the 21st century sources, I'm very much drawn to the Sierra College Research Institute and C-SPAN in particular, because unlike the others, which seem to be mostly asking historians \"give this president a score, and we'll tally all the figures up\", these two surveys both were conducted a number of times, and breakdown the scores for each president into sub-categories, so we are able to see in which areas historians think a President's administration was good, middling and poor.   The most recent Sierra College data is here, for those who are interested, and the most recent C-SPAN data is here.  Now we see some further curious things. Starting with the C-SPAN data, Reagan's highest scores are \"Public Persuasion\" (90.9), \"Vision/Setting an Agenda\" (84.9), and \"International Relations\" (76.8). His three lowest scores are \"Pursued Equal Justice for All\" (44.6), \"Administrative Skills\" (47.4), and \"Economic Management\" (60.9 - this actually puts him 16th and in between John Adams and John Quincy Adams). So interestingly, even though this survey overall ranks Reagan as 9th, it's with his administration itself being considered not well run, being very unequal in its domestic impacts, and having OK-but-not-amazing economic returns.  Now let's look at Sierra College (Reagan score: 13th), which has a frankly dizzying data set with overall scores, overall sub-scores in \"Attributes\", \"Abilities\" and \"Accomplishments\", and then *sub-sub-scores* within those fields.

            " Okay, finally a question that I'm probably one of the few people qualified to answer. My historical background is just a BA and MA in history, writing primarily on US Army Air Force bombing campaigns in WWII, with particular attention to targeting of civilians - I know, not what we're talking about, but just letting you know I'm one of you but am writing a bit outside of my academic wheelhouse. Professionally, I am an Air Force pilot and have flown against Soviet era AAA and SAM systems across the world, admittedly mostly against ancient ones with poorly trained operators. I will make sure I don't violate rule 4 with \"personal/anecdotal\" experience by backing myself up with sources, which is good practice anyways because if I write about stuff that I do at work, I need to make sure it's already on there so I don't embarrass myself like this.   **Caveat**: My training in counter SAMs / SEAD (suppression of enemy air defenses) began in 2014, not 1986, and even then, it was the basics - I don't specialize in it, I don't fly F-35s or F-16CJs like my Wild Weasel brethren that live for this. I'm using old copies of Jane's, which are available to me through a subscription I have from work - these are not classified, but are behind a paywall. Jane's has been the gold standard of quantifying and comparing military equipment across pretty much every category - aircraft, planes, weapons, etc, and has been since the late 19th century. The oldest copy of it that I've touched in a 1898 edition of Jane's Fighting Ships in the stacks at Air University's library in Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. While it is a western publication, I'm using references across the years to get more accurate data. Of course, newer systems are less likely to have accurate data, and data gets more accurate as Soviet client states broke off and allowed western intelligence to analyze the systems or they were seen in combat and western intelligence extrapolated based on their performance.  **Assumption**: You mentioned a small airplane, but did not specify which, so I will fill in. One of the most ubiquitous US civilian airplanes is the Cessna 172 Skyhawk. Anecdotal, but it is also the first plane I ever flew, and probably the first for the majority of American pilots. It's an almost 70 year old plane now, so it would be available for your hypothetical flight.  **Data and Methodology**: First, a quick term to explain - radar cross section (RCS). This is a measurement of a plane's reflectivity on radar. It's based off the material, shape, size, and smoothness of a plane's surface. The Cessna 172 has a RCS of 10m^2 worst case. Worst case means with the nose of the aircraft pointed towards the radar. To compare this with other planes of its day, an F-14 Tomcat would have a 25m^2 RCS, an F-15C's is 20m^2, an F-16's is an impressive 5m^2. Today's F-22's unclassified/estimated RCS is .0001m^2, roughly the size of a marble. Long story short, your Cessna would be measurable on radar if it was tuned to look for something like you.  **Answer, kinda**: Without getting TOO much into how radars work, typical Soviet SA systems are not on 24/7 unless put on alert, they rely on men located at the radar site, and there are several layers of both range and sensitivity across several different types of SAMs. Strategic SAM systems aren't sensitive, they're meant to pick up US nuclear bombers and send a heavy missile that doesn't need to maneuver to hit its target, so they have very high ranges. Tactical SAM systems can be sensitive, but their range suffers because their missiles are intended for fighters that can 'defend' via their agility and turns, so the missiles need to keep up. Go figure, I can't source any documentation of Soviet missile defense deployments in 1986, so I can't tell you if there's an ingress route or not with certainty. HOWEVER - I can make an educated guess based on sheer geography and military knowledge. The Soviet Union's entire eastern half is incredibly low density population-wise, and it's huge. Because they can't exactly make a wall of ZSU-23-4s across their eastern border, there are likely several gaps you could ingress into and avoid detection by flying nap of the earth (i.e., low). For more on Soviet air defenses, this 1989 article on anticipated Soviet reactions to US stealth technology goes into their organization.    The thing you'd have to worry most about is interceptors. MiG-25s or MiG-31s could be flying a CAP anywhere, and although big sky theory is a thing, depending on so many factors (their position, your position, your color, sun reflectivity, etc.), you could be easy to spot with their Mk. I Eyeball sensors (incredibly advanced, I know). Additionally, most interceptors have radars that can be a bit more sensitive to other aircraft since they don't have to worry about the ground. Can't find a good illustration for an aircraft of that era, but this one serves well enough for the premise.   ALL OF THAT BEING SAID, you can pretty much disregard it all, because as many aviation fans know, Mathias Rust was a young, 50 hour Cessna 172 pilot (for reference, 50 hours is about what I'd expect the most basic of private pilots to have before being allowed to fly without an instructor in the US) who took his plane from West Germany to Iceland to Finland and then landed directly in Moscow's Red Square. Unlike your hypothetical flight, young Mathias did not make a return trip until he was pardoned about a year later, but I think it's worth mentioning because he WAS picked up on Soviet air defense radar, he WAS intercepted by Soviet aircraft, and through various failures and breakdowns in Soviet C2, he made it through what was the most heavily defended and fortified air space in the world outside of the US.  To summarize, you probably could, but it would take a lot of precise flying, a pre-planned flight where you avoided populated areas and landed away from anywhere, and then returned without refueling (unless you have a perfect Russian accent and enough rubles to somehow arrange for AV gas to be transported to you), which would incredibly limit your options. Also, you're probably landing without a runway to avoid civilization, so I hope you're really good and can also find some dense ground that fits all of those conditions and is large enough for you to take off in.

As the Speech implies, the Ahnenerbe did have some very odd pseudo-scientific and occult ideas, and it is this organization from which the pop-culture trope of \"Occult Nazis\" flows in most part. It was essentially a pet project of Himmler to uncover the \"hidden history\" of the Aryan race by sending research teams to far-flung locations in order to take fiend recordings, photographs, cranial measurements and the like to prove that great civilizations of the world were Germanic in origin. It's an interesting story in itself with some truly odd characters - Wirth, Otto Rahn, Karl-Maria Willigut and so forth. But it was a small operation and not reflective of party policy.  &#x200B;  The relationship between the Churches and the Nazi state is an interesting question in itself. While Hitler certainly did not approve of a politically active Church system, either Protestant or Catholic, he always stepped lightly around directly confronting them.

It's an interesting story in itself with some truly odd characters - Wirth, Otto Rahn, Karl-Maria Willigut and so forth. But it was a small operation and not reflective of party policy.  &#x200B;  The relationship between the Churches and the Nazi state is an interesting question in itself. While Hitler certainly did not approve of a politically active Church system, either Protestant or Catholic, he always stepped lightly around directly confronting them. In fact, the policy of not directly antagonizing the churches is behind the rebuke to the Ahnenerbe I mention above.   Sources:  The Occult roots of Nazism.

        "rejected_target": " This earlier answer by /u/commiespaceinvader addresses most of your questions!  * How interested was Hitler in the occult?  I know the question itself seems simplistic, but the answer goes into far more detail and topics.  /u/commiespaceinvader (again!) discusses the Nazis and Christianity here, too, in more depth:  * Did the repression of religion in the Third Reich and the Soviet Union make it easier to commit crimes on humanity?"

    "\n\nHuman: Was Gen. Washington a tactically good General? I think we are all well aware of General Washington's political savvy: drawing France into the war, helping to draw up the Constitution and reject the Articles of Confederation; and his most farsighted act of resigning as president after his second term to avoid political legacy/Washington domination. In schools, however, it is accepted that Washington was a great general -- from the time of his serving as an officer in colonial wars to his role of General and Chief of the Continental Armies. Was Washington, however, a good General? I know this may be too broad a question to effectively answer so was he a good general in terms of his: tactical, strategic, and field command? Or any other traits you find to be useful in assessing the effectiveness of a general?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Washington is a fascinating case study for 18th century warfare because, superficially, he wasn't all that impressive in the typical way we measure these things, which tends to hyperfocus on individual battles or particular innovations. Those are certainly important, but war is about 90% *everything else* and 10% battle success. You wouldn't usually get that sense from most popular history, though.  Before I go on, I'll say that personally I believe that Washington was an exceptional general, who was able to capitalize on the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of a diverse and rather chaotic colonial military establishment (or lack thereof), employ talented brigadiers and subalterns, create a talented staff and intelligence system, keep the army supplied and unified even in the face of indifference or outright hostility from local populations as well as the Continental Congress, all that to say *nothing* of opposition by experienced British generals, well-ordered enemy troops, highly motivated loyalist militias, and the most powerful navy in the world. It is *incredible* that the rebellion was successful, and a great deal of its success rests on Washington's soldiers.  It's also worth pointing out that these qualities were by no means known at the time, his selection as the commander in chief of the army was by and large a political one, which I've written about here.   After the war, Washington remained a central figure in American politics and his leadership rested on building consensus and exhausting diplomatic options before resorting to force - such as during the Whiskey Rebellion.  I've also written about the moment I think best demonstrates Washington's leadership abilities, and the awe with which his men nearly universally held him. To summarize: after the end of the war's major hostilities, Washington faced a mutiny led by many of his officers as a result of lack of promised pay and poor treatment of the army in general by congress and an indifferent colonial people. His response was to demonstrate that he had shared all of these hardships and \"had not only gone gray, but nearly blind\" in the same service of his men.  And these grown men, hardened by years of war and jaded by lack of support from leaders and civilians alike, *broke into tears*, and the mutiny was more or less defanged. It's one of the clearest examples of an individual's influence on major events as exists in history, in my opinion. Other men in the Continental Army had more impressive victories, more experience, even more popularity or political influence, but Washington commanded a respect that even his political opponents recognized.  It's difficult to imagine anyone else achieving what Washington was able to, but of course we can't know. Other \"great\" military leaders were similarly constrained by economic, logistical, political, and popular contexts and worked within or around them; comparing Washington's achievement even to a contemporary like Napoleon is limited to their records only, which can't get any deeper than surface-level, as it pretty much immediately veers sharply into counterfactual speculation.  So again, yes. Washington has examples of tactical sophistication and well-conceived and executed set-piece battles - his withdrawal from Long Island, the Siege of Boston, the Battle of Trenton,  the Battle of Princeton, the Siege of Yorktown - that demonstrated his leadership and organizational abilities. If they seem on a smaller scale than Napoleonic battles, it's because the war as a whole was fought on a much smaller scale than European battles, even in the same period. So yes, he had tactical acumen necessary, but I would again emphatically suggest that his qualities lay in his charisma and ability to keep together a fairly ragtag and sometimes unreliable military structure alive and dangerous during a very difficult war that proves his reputation.  ______  Edward Lengel's General George Washington: A Military Life is still one of the better works on the topic of Washington's military career.  Richard Kohn, *Eagle and Sword* speaks a great deal about Washington's post-war career.  Lastly, Charles Royster\u2019s excellent *A Revolutionary People At War* talks a great deal about the emotional stakes of the War for Independence.",
            " I'm going to unpack your question a bit because I think part of what you're touching on is the American myth of Washington which tends to deify a man who was extraordinary because he rose above his relative banality.  Washington was probably not, or there's little evidence anyway, an incredible tactical commander although he certainly had his moments of genius. Where he excelled beyond all others was his ability to lead. He was arguably personally responsible for touching off the Seven Years War, resulting in his defeat at Fort Necessity. For this he was hailed as a hero. He then participated in the Braddock Campaign, with equally poor results. In a harbinger of his later battlefield presence, he prevented the defeat from turning into an all-out massacre by rallying the battered troops and conducting a relatively orderly retreat. For this second disaster he was awarded command of a regiment. He spent most of the rest of the war fighting the Indians on the frontier with some success and high casualties.  His service in the Revolutionary War would be similarly lackluster from a win-loss perspective but he had a crucial trait, a command presence, that allowed him to do what almost no one else in the colonies could have done - unite a disparate group of ragtag colonial militias into a relatively unified fighting force that could survive (although not win) direct confrontations with the world's preeminent military power. His power had political consequences but his mere presence was often enough to prevent defeats from turning into disasters. His primary goal early in the war was the preservation of the army at all costs until it could be armed, equipped, and trained into an actual counter to the British regulars and their Hessian hirelings. He also seems to have won when it mattered most - Boston, when the nascent revolution would have been strangled in its cradle if he'd lost, Trenton and Princeton, when the army was on its heels and could have been destroyed under a lesser commander.  You mention drawing France into the war - it's worth noting that France wanted the war since their defeat in the Seven Years War, did everything in its power to provoke the war, was scouting the continent as tensions mounted before the war even broke out to ascertain the relative likelihood of success if a war were to erupt, and bankrolled the American war effort while setting up a massive smuggling operation to empty French and Spanish armories into the hands of the Americans on credit until they were able to openly enter the war. Their decision was influenced in no small part by the presence of Washington. While the colonial politicians were seen as fractious and unreliable, colonial generals were seen as vain and untrained, colonial troops were seen as peasant militias, Washington was viewed as almost an aristocrat whose word could be trusted and who would see the thing through if only given the means.  It's hard to overstate the full amount of means the French, Spanish, and Dutch supplied. The French realized they needed to modernize their army to confront the British, something they had every intention of doing. This meant they would have a lot of military surplus as they re-equipped modern formations with modern weapons. The French king and his cousin, the king of Spain, created a shell corporation run by the guy who invented Figaro, the Barber of Seville, and fronted him 2 million francs in secret. They then sold the antiquated contents of their armories on the open market, where it was promptly bought up by their shell company and shipped to America on credit. The first major shipments arrived just before the battle of Saratoga and equipped an American army in full retreat to the point where they turned around, confronted Burgoyne's army, and won. In John Trumbull's famous painting of the surrender, a French cannon is pictured prominently in the foreground. By the end of the war, the French would supply 90% of the gunpowder the American army used as well as similar quantities of tents, uniforms, muskets, ammunition, and other supplies. Perhaps more importantly, the French shell company found military experts from across Europe and recruited them to the American cause including names like Lafayette and von Steuben. French money paid their salaries and passage to the country, where they helped build forts, command artillery, and forge the American army into a fighting force that could confront the regular British Army.  Notably, when French forces openly entered the war they had their own plans about the best military strategy to be pursued. Their contribution was not insignificant - at Savannah there were more French troops than American. The French met with Washington to discuss strategy where Washington outlined his plans. Again, reflecting on his command presence, the French not only acquiesced to his strategy but placed their troops under his command. ***Edit: /u/pedro3131 raises a good point here - Washington wanted to attack New York while Rochambeau preferred to attack in the south. They agreed to consult Admiral de Grasse to get his input and he also preferred the southern plan (although Rochambeau let de Grasse know his preference). At least nominally the decision was Washington's but arguably if your ally with all the ships and half the troops wants to do something, that's what you do so perhaps it's more appropriate to say they nominally acquiesced to his strategy. Perhaps fortunately Washington had the humility not to press the point. Either way, I think it's a valid enough issue to add this note and credit to /u/pedro3131 for catching it.*** You're talking a French nobleman, a decorated veteran of the Seven Years War, a Lieutenant General in the most powerful military on the planet (up until the Seven Years War, which was still considered to be a possible anomaly), submitting command of his troops to a Virginia planter. He had an army as large as the American army and far more professional but was willing to let Washington take the lead. THAT is what made Washington great.  So if we recap your question - Washington wasn't great at winning but he was great ensuring that losing the battle didn't lead to losing the war. He certainly had moments of tactical brilliance and his field command prevented defeats from turning into disaster. Strategically, he had a very clear grasp of what needed to be done and when, as well as an almost ruthless willingness to make it happen. He knew that winning battles was important but not losing the army was far more important. He knew that surviving was what needed to happen until his militia could be molded into an army. He had the foresight and humility to let other people take credit when it was necessary to the cause. He could inspire the confidence of peasant farmers shivering in the misery of Valley Forge and induce a French nobleman of the ancien regime to not only follow his strategy but give him command of the army he'd brought to aid the American cause. I would say Washington was quite possibly the only American who could have won the war, even though he barely won any battles. Does that make him a great general? I can't think of a single measure of a general that would be more dispositive than their ability to win the war, so I think the answer would be \"yes\".",

    "\n\nHuman: /r/AskHistorians April Fools 2015 Round Up Hello Everyone!  As most people have long since picked up on, for the past day or so, /r/AskHistorians has been transformed into /r/AskFantasyHistorians, bringing our usual eye for quality and detail from the historical to the fictional. As they day's festivities come to a close, the mod team would like to extend their thanks - to all of the users of the sub of course, but especially to those who thought up some of the fantastic questions that came in, as well as those who put in the time and effort to answer them. When we were planning this out, we couldn't even begin to fathom the amount of interest this would generate, and it is really amazing to see how much (almost) everyone enjoyed this!  A few shout-outs to be made. Firstly, if you enjoyed this, I highly suggest you start frequenting /r/AskScienceFiction, a subreddit which fields these questions daily. Additionally, I know that users are looking to get both /r/AskFantasyHistorians and /r/AskFictionHistorians off the ground in a style to imitate what we were doing here, I believe with the intention of the same sort of mock seriousness encouraged here today, so check those out, and maybe help get them off the ground.  Additionally, /u/gunslingrburrito deserves a little recognition for now having the all-time top submission in the subreddit with How did the Eagles manage to rescue Frodo and Sam at Mt Doom and still have time to record \"Hotel California\"?, which as some have pointed out, is not without irony as it displaced [META] This is one of the few subreddits that has maintained a high level of quality and professionalism over time, thank you..  Of course, to my fellow mods, who together registered over 4,500 moderation actions during April Fools, most especially /u/searocksandtrees and /u/vertexoflife whose behind the scenes work was a key part of ensuring the day ran smoothly.  And finally an apology to all of the users who made non-April Fools submissions over the past day that got drowned out in the noise. Please do consider resubmitting them, and we promise that our flairs are doing penance for the tomfoolery by being extra diligent in their responses for the next few days.  As of this evening, new Fantasy submissions have been turned off for a few hours now, so you will notice new submissions returning to normal, real historical topics. We know that few people were able to keep an eye on everything, so there are a few ways to peruse this year's April Fools threads. The existing threads - which you are still welcome to post in right now - are being marked with \"April Fools\" flair to easily distinguish them (currently in progress), and additionally we have done our best to compile a complete list of the submissions over the past day, which you can find here (and check out last year's here).

    "\n\nHuman: What would 1950s America have found obscene about the word \"pregnancy\" in the context of I Love Lucy's two married characters having a baby? Much has been made of 1950s sitcom *I Love Lucy* depicting the first pregnancy storyline in American television. However, CBS censors deemed the word \"pregnancy\" to be too obscene for American audiences even in the context of married characters who also happened to be married in real life. CBS opted to go with the euphemism \"Lucy is Enceinte\" to avoid upsetting American sensibilities of the time.   My question is: why would pregnancy be considered obscene to the average American audience when pregnancy is generally considered (to the best of my knowledge) the least taboo and most celebrated aspect of reproduction. Especially when pregnancy occurs within the traditional confines of a marriage.   What need in American society was this censorship fulfilling?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Lucille Ball had already had one child but prior to filming season 1 of *I Love Lucy* (she was 6 months pregnant filming the unaired pilot but it wasn't shown until 1990). After the first season ended she was pregnant again, but CBS, Biow Agency (the ad group) and Philip Morris (the sponsor) insisted that the show could not show a pregnant woman on television.  This led to an extended argument with the creators of the show; Biow tried to offer a compromise of only doing one or two episodes.  Desi Arnaz (Lucille Ball's co-star) sent a letter to Alfred Lyons (chairmen of Philip Morris) that I Love Lucy was the number one show on television and explained they had previously had creative control, and that if they were going to tell them what not to do they also had to tell them what to do (and given a cigarette company was not filled with TV creatives, any negative consequences to ratings were their own).  Allegedly, this led to Lyons sending a private memo through the company  >Don't ---- around with the Cuban!  although I'm unclear if the blank was filled in or not. All objections from Philip Morris stopped.  CBS still had the directive that the word \"pregnant\" couldn't be used, and the writer Jess Oppenheimer came up with the idea to have each of the \"baby\" scripts approved by a priest, a minister, and a rabbi, and the writers would remove anything that was objectionable. (This is not a regular protocol, although the 2016 movie Hail, Caesar! about the 1950s movie industry has a similar event in the plot, likely based on the I Love Lucy situation.)  This idea won the CBS executives over, who felt like this would be sufficient shielding for them offending anyone.   This led to a seven-script series starting with Lucy Is Enceinte, followed by Pregnant Women Are Unpredictable (*), and finishing with Lucy Goes to the Hospital, where Lucy Ricardo finally gives birth; it aired the same day Lucille Ball gave birth. (This was  coordinated as she knew she was going to need a caesarean -- her first had to be for medical reasons, and the same reasons applied.) This led to an estimated 44 million viewers for the episode, beating the inauguration of Dwight Eisenhower the same week (only 29 million viewers).  (*) Yes, the episode name contains the word pregnant! The name is not showing during the episode and in the episode itself there's a dialogue swap with the line \"expectant women are unpredictable\".  ...  Let's step back just a little, to the 1930s; you can expect the CBS executives were in that frame of mind. From a 1937 handbook for film writers (applying in general, not just to CBS):  >Pregnancy, or expected \"blessed events,\" should never be discussed as such in screen stories. Most censor boards not only frown upon, but almost always delete any such references. Any direct or crude reference to pregnancy in films is considered out-of-place exactly as it would be in any normal society where children are present. It is entirely acceptable, of course, to refer to the baby that is expected, but any reference to conception, child-bearing, and child-birth is considered improper for public discussion.  Essentially, there was a strong enough avoidance of sex that the *implication* that sex had occurred was also to be avoided.   But, again this was guidelines carried from the 1930s: what about the real world of the 1950s? By this time the culture had evolved. If you recall the three clergymen from before, they not only had no issues with any of the scripts, they even commented on the \"pregnant\" word situation:  >What's wrong with the word pregnant?

    "\n\nHuman: Reading letters from history, I'm struck by how intimate and affectionate the friendships are between male friends. We find this between Hamilton and Laurens, and between Lincoln and Speed. When did men shift from writing each other love letters, to just getting together for some drinks? *\u201cYou know my desire to befriend you is everlasting, that I will never cease, while I know how to do any thing.\u201d*    -- Lincoln to his friend Joshua Speed  *\"Cold in my professions, warm in [my] friendships, I wish, my Dear Laurens, it m[ight] be in my power, by action rather than words, [to] convince you that I love you. I shall only tell you that 'till you bade us Adieu, I hardly knew the value you had taught my heart to set upon you. Indeed, my friend, it was not well done. You know the opinion I entertain of mankind, and how much it is my desire to preserve myself free from particular attachments, and to keep my happiness independent on the caprice of others. You sh[ould] not have taken advantage of my sensibility to ste[al] into my affections without my consent. But as you have done it and as we are generally indulgent to those we love, I shall not scruple to pardon the fraud you have committed, on condition that for my sake, if not for your own, you will always continue to merit the partiality, which you have so artfully instilled into [me].\"*   -- Hamilton to John Laurens  ------------  I don't think I'm making a leap by asserting that these kinds of sentiments are no longer common (except among the extremely inebriated). Yet, they're not rare at all in the history of letters -- men would write *super* emotional, sentimental letters to their best friends, certainly in the 19th century but also before. I know that it was also common for good friends to share the same bed (Ben Franklin and John Adams), hold hands, and even sit on each other's laps to display affection.   So what exactly changed in the West between the 19th century and the 21st century that made male friendship so much more restrictive?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " The Victorian era is infamous, rightly or wrongly, for its repression of sexuality. But its temporal and philosophical heir definitely did repress the possibility of the homoromantic relationships between women and between men that had been normal, if not the norm, for centuries and centuries. This process was rooted in one of society's most fundamental adopted divisions, gender, so you can imagine that there are a whole lot of factors implicated in the shift that are all tangled around each other and mutually reinforcing. Some of the key ones include: industrialization and urbanization, women's colleges, class concerns, a *crisis in masculinity* (masculinity is always in crisis), and most importantly, the invention of \"sexology\" as a field of science at a time that science played a central role in cataloguing and normatively ordering society.   Anthony Rotundo, primarily studying men, argues that \"romantic friendships\" in America start to become visible in the Revolutionary War era and flourish in the mid-19th century. The 18th century is kind of a black hole for me so I'll take his word for when the concept of romantic friendships was jump-started, but it was by no means new. In the Middle Ages, Christians and Muslims alike wrote poetry and composed letters depicting homoromantic and even homoerotic relationships. I'm going back this far not for the heck of it, but because medieval society helps clarify key qualities of male and female \"romantic friendships\" that contributed to their eventual demise: a societal value on men expressing emotion (knightly tears; religious devotions) and the very, very limited possibilities for unmarried women to rise above the poorest classes. Romantic friendships did not threaten men's sense of themselves as men, patriarchal control of women, or marriage.  Socio-economic changes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries knocked all of that askew.  The 1870s-1920s saw a massive influx of young women and men into U.S. cities. On one hand, this was an age-old process that, for centuries, was basically the season cities could exist (they were population sinks--on their own, city residents could not reproduce enough to replace themselves given mortality rates). On the other, the type of work they found and the pathways for success in that work were much more recent. The old system of apprenticeships and family connections for men, and almost exclusively domestic servant work for women, absolutely persisted but were swamped by the numbers of factory workers and non-domestic service workers. To support the population boom, cities constructed residential hotels/dormitories/apartments that were often designated single-sex.  That situation made both male and female romantic friendships a threat to the gendered prescriptions of society. For men, it diminished the utility of romantic friendships as potential economic and social connections, meaning they wouldn't be stepping stones towards supporting their eventual family. For women, it opened a much more achievable possibility of financial stability outside marriage.   The blossoming of women's colleges at this time made that problem even clearer to the sexuality reformers and sexologists we'll meet in a little--because \"these women\" were most assuredly middle and upper-middle class. In short: the ideal marriage partners for men...in an environment where romantic friendships could permit them both prestigious social roles (scholars, administrators, politicians, professional artists, etc) and economic *success* without men. This was true, even long-term, for both students and teachers. About 10% of American women at the end of the 19th century never married; the figure was around 50% for graduates of women's colleges. So when men observed, as in this letter to the Yale student newspaper:  > There is a term in general use at Vassar, truly calculated to awaken within the *ima penetralia* of our souls all that love for the noble and the aesthetic of which our natures are capable, The term in question is \"smashing.\"  > When a Vassar girl takes a shine to another, she straightway enters upon a regular course of bouquet sendings, interspersed with tinted notes, mysterious packages of \u2018Ridley\u2019s Mixed Candies,\u2019 locks of hair perhaps, and many other tender tokens, until at last the object of her attentions is captured, the two women become inseparable, and the aggressor is considered by her circle of acquaintances as \"smashed.\"  they might not have seen sexual competition, but the possibility of a lifestyle threat was lurking.  Men's romantic friendships were also under fire with respect to their emotionality. The gradual militarization of western culture over the 19th century (think the Salvation *Army* or the military trappings of the Boy Scouts) drove/was driven by a narrowing definition of masculinity on \"muscles\"--vigor, strength, athleticism, the Teddy Roosevelt stereotype. Whereas emotions had once been the healthy counterpart, gradually the internal dimensions of character and a value on openness and gentleness became a liability. (Marriage was still okay, because the idealized marriage was the husband/father rising up to 'be a man' and take care of his family).  Steeped in all these burgeoning developments and their implications came the sexologists, with an agenda not just to categorize society but to evangelize their \"discoveries.\"  A lot of us are at least in passing familiar with the \"homosexuality didn't exist as 'homosexuality', an identity, before 1900\" trope. This can be taken too far (and often is), but it is nevertheless true that the later decades of the 19th century and early 20th century saw professional, middle-class scientists coalescing ideas of same-sex sexual relations according to Science rather than morality. Instead of a wrong step by step choice, it was an abnormal physical, inherited trait.  This idea got mixed up in Progressive Era utopian visions of societal improvement that, among other things, tagged \"deviants\" and lower-class people as hindering forward progress--just as same-sex sex, now identified with the people who practiced it, prevented heterosexual, reproductive sex.  And scientists like Bernard Talmey exhibited one of my favorite characteristics of historical men writing about women: in his 1904 book on, well, women, he announced his deep concern that the American public \"does not even surmise of the existence\" of sex between women. It was a scientific version of what I see in my medieval (male) clerics skating gingerly around actually mentioning lesbian activity because they don't want to put the idea in women's minds.  But this view of American sexologists, lagging somewhat behind their European counterparts, was crucial to the decline of romantic friendships among men and women. First, because it started off with a condemnation of these friendships that took away from social order *regardless* of whether there was sexual activity involved.   Second, because of the label first stacked onto the participants: inverts. That is, the inversion of proper sex/sexual order. Here we meet up with the rise of muscular masculinity *against* emotionality and gentleness, as well women's political activity and independent economic power *against* the norm of a separate women's/domestic sphere.  And so romantic friendships, instead of a natural part of growing up for men and women, became an aberration--not in the sense of \"rare\", but in the sense of \"wrong.\"  ...Unbeknownst to the sexologists, however, their codification of language and an identity for homosexual men and women gave people who did experience same-sex attraction a *mutual* self-understanding--a certain legitimacy. It's seen as the beginning of an LGBTQ+ movement (if not yet a civil rights one). So there is a lot to mourn about the loss of romantic friendships and what it signified. But this is one story about the past that also has a future."

        "sft_target": " The Victorian era is infamous, rightly or wrongly, for its repression of sexuality. But its temporal and philosophical heir definitely did repress the possibility of the homoromantic relationships between women and between men that had been normal, if not the norm, for centuries and centuries. This process was rooted in one of society's most fundamental adopted divisions, gender, so you can imagine that there are a whole lot of factors implicated in the shift that are all tangled around each other and mutually reinforcing. Some of the key ones include: industrialization and urbanization, women's colleges, class concerns, a *crisis in masculinity* (masculinity is always in crisis), and most importantly, the invention of \"sexology\" as a field of science at a time that science played a central role in cataloguing and normatively ordering society.   Anthony Rotundo, primarily studying men, argues that \"romantic friendships\" in America start to become visible in the Revolutionary War era and flourish in the mid-19th century. The 18th century is kind of a black hole for me so I'll take his word for when the concept of romantic friendships was jump-started, but it was by no means new. In the Middle Ages, Christians and Muslims alike wrote poetry and composed letters depicting homoromantic and even homoerotic relationships.

            " With gratitude to SepehrNS for the tag! I have a couple of earlier answers that might help. The closest one is:  * Since most of our physical and visual perceptions of hell come from Dante or later works, what did earlier medieval European Christians associate hell with in a visual or physical sense?  ~~  Yeah, yeah, Dante always gets all the credit. Don't get me wrong--the breathtaking scope, literary dexterity, theological and political ambition of the *Commedia* make it a suitable and attention-grabbing reference point. But Dante's versions of hell, purgatory, and heaven are deeply rooted in more than a millennium of Christian visions of the afterlife (influenced by various pre-Christian and philosophical traditions as well). For the early Middle Ages up through 1200, in fact, visions of heaven and hell were the single most popular form of religious vision narrative in the Latin west. (They don't exactly diminish in popularity afterwards, but other forms of visions become cultural tsunamis). Don't worry; for this answer I will concentrate on hell. ;)  The Bible does give us the idea of a \"lake of fire,\" but it's remarkably scant on other details. Nevertheless, already in the New Testament apocrypha (texts written a bit later than the canonical NT books), there are extensive visions of the afterlife in the *Apocalypse of Peter* and in the *Shepherd of Hermas*. The *Apocalypse of Peter* is intriguing because it already develops the idea of the contrapasso, or \"the punishment symbolizes the sin.\"   Early medieval voyages to the afterlife often take on, as a whole, the tone of a morality tale. A newly deceased sinner is given a cosmic tour, only to come back to life to spread the message of the joys of paradise/horrors of hell (and, of course, they inevitably clean up their life). One of the innovations of this era, that Dante will also draw out, is the use of hell visions as political weapons. More often this is much vaguer than Dante, like placing all the bishops who buy and sell offices in hell. But there's a reason for that. These visions are written and passed down as experiences that \"actually happened\"--as genuine witnesses to the underworld.  By the high Middle Ages, there's a new wrinkle in the medieval visionary tradition: the idea that \"living saints,\" particularly women, are specially graced by God with divine visions. Although much of the women's visionary corpus is Christocentric, many visionaries receive (or ask for and are denied, as with Julian of Norwich in the 14-15C) a short trip through heaven and/or hell. Women's visionaries of purgatory, meanwhile, often involve these living saints actually *pulling people out* according to God's will and then by their own prayerful and ascetic intercession. Mechthild of Hackeborn, a late 13th century German visionary whose visions of paradise sparkle with gemstones and light, is typically proposed as Dante's \"Matilda\"--that is, that he was familiar with her and her visionary text, the Liber specialis gratie.  But for my money, the best high medieval vision of hell belongs to Mechthild of *Magdeburg*, an independent religious women slightly older than her co-named monastic counterpart. Mechthild has extensive and lavishly described visions of paradise and purgatory as well, but her hell is top-notch. You can read a fair portion of Frank Tobin's translation of it on Google Books (scroll down a bit on that first page), and you absolutely should.  > I have seen a city / its name is eternal hate  > It was built in the deepest abyss / From all kinds of stones of huge capital sins  > ...] Lucifer sits bound by his guilt in the deepest abyss. There flows unceasingly out of his fiery heart and out of his mouth all the sins, torments, sickness, and shame in which hell, purgatory, and the earth are so wretchedly entangled.

Oh, Mechthild!  I introduce that last bit because there is a parallel tradition that passes down ideas of (especially) hell in the Middle Ages: art. Indeed, depictions of hell were a standard feature in church sculpture, generally as part of a Last Judgment scene. And while Dante's \"gates of hell\" have their place in iconography (though note that Satan's jaws have a starring role in the lowest level of hell), Mechthild's reference to hell having a head arrives at *the* iconographic symbol of hell up to the Reformation: the hellmouth.

            " At one point or another, you've probably seen this statue of Leonidas, forever guarding the pass at Thermopylai.jpg).  The statue was funded by Greek Americans, sculpted by Vassos Falireas, and set up in 1955. It stands in a long line of monuments to the Greek defeat at Thermopylai that started the year after the battle and continues to recent times. In 1997, the Greek government added a further monument to celebrate the 700 men of Thespiai who stayed behind and fought to the death with Leonidas.  What are all these people doing, celebrating an unmitigated disaster? Because make no mistake: the battle of Thermopylai was a crushing defeat for the Greek alliance. At minimal loss of troops and time, Xerxes dislodged the Greek army from the strongest position in their land, killing a Spartan king and 4,000 of his men. Leonidas had thrown away his life and that of 300 Spartan citizens, achieving literally nothing. On the face of it, there was no reason for the Greeks to celebrate. Our sources give no hint of the popular idea that the last stand of the 300 Spartans was a moral victory that united and galvanised the Greeks. Herodotos simply refers to the battle as \"the defeat at Thermopylai\" (8.27.1) and \"the defeat of the Spartans\" (8.66.1). Even after the battle, he stresses the constant disappointment of the Athenians at the Spartans' timidity and lack of commitment to the cause (8.40.2, 9.6). Thermopylai was the closest they came to losing the war altogether.  Of course, we know that the Greek allies came back from the brink and eventually defeated the Persians. But this happened in later battles - Salamis, Plataiai and Mykale - with their own separate ancient and modern monuments. The eventual Greek victory against Xerxes doesn't explain why they built all these monuments to their greatest failure.   These monuments started early. Already in Herodotos' day there was a stone lion on the hill where Leonidas fell, and several epigrams to honour the men who fought and died there. Herodotos would have lived long enough to see the tomb of Leonidas that the Spartans built back in Sparta, after they solemnly conveyed his bones home for reburial. Every year they organised a festival and held games in his honour; he was the only Spartan to receive heroic cult. Why all this effort to commemorate defeat?  The answer is simple. Monuments don't immortalise facts; they immortalise heroes. Monuments don't serve historical truth but political agendas.  We have no evidence that the Spartans had a reputation as skilled or courageous fighters before Thermopylai. They didn't tell the kind of stories about themselves that we now tell about the Spartans. But after their defeat at Thermopylai, they badly needed such stories. The rest of the Greeks were stirring; they no longer showed much respect for their supposed hegemon and leader, Sparta, now that it had proved slow and noncommittal and ineffective against the Persian threat. Several states refused to join the fight; others, like Athens, threatened to sail for Italy and leave Greece to its fate. In short, Sparta had fucked up, and desperately needed to change the narrative to show the rest of the Greeks that the Spartans were still worthy to lead them.  So they unleashed what we should probably imagine as a massive propaganda campaign. Through careful management of the information others learned about the battle, the invention of numerous details and prophecies, and by recruiting the legendary poet Simonides of Keos for their cause, they took complete control of the way people remembered Thermopylai. The story of an inexperienced king who led a deliberately understrength force to its pointless destruction was transformed into a heroic narrative of sacrifice for a higher cause. Where the Greeks had accused the Spartans of committing only the bare minimum of troops, the Spartans retorted that none had brought a greater sacrifice: every last one of their men had chosen to stay and die! In fact they had refused to let their allies fight at all, they were so eager to commit themselves to the cause! Their king had fallen bravely in the face of the enemy, in accordance with the eternal laws of Sparta and the oracle that foretold it was the only way to save the rest of Greece! Who would not be inspired by such selfless courage? You know the rest.  Monuments to the bravery of the dead were a crucial part of this propaganda campaign. Simonides' epigrams were set up on the site of the battle so that everyone who passed through would read them. The stone lion for Leonidas made a similar point. Later on, for reasons to do with internal politics at Sparta, the remains of Leonidas were \"found\" and transported back to Sparta for further monumentalisation and celebration. By that time there was no longer much dissent against the official Spartan story of Thermopylai.  Through the centuries, people all over Europe and the wider world have been inspired by that official story. It is, of course, mostly a lie - but one that people find irresistible.

            " Hi there-- not discouraging further responses, but you may be interested in these two older posts regarding Confederate (and other) monuments:   https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6v1yj5/monday_methods_collective_memory_or_lets_talk/  and   https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6umym5/when_perusing_wikipedias_list_of_confederate/dlu81ws/",
            " The 1891 Chilean Civil War saw a conflict between supporters of the Chilean National Congress and supporters of President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Balmaceda. In 1891 the Congress refused to approve Balmaceda\u2019s proposed budget (the Ley de Presupuesto) and Balmaceda responded by approving, de facto, the budget from the prior year, and declared himself the only national authority. On January 7, 1891, civil war broke out.  After learning of the defeat of his forces at the Battle of Placilla, Balmaceda left the government palace in Santiago (La Moneda) and took refuge inside the Argentine Embassy. He stayed there for twenty days. On September 19, 1891, the day after his presidential mandate ended, he commited suicide.  He continues to be a controversial figure; supporters of his presidency see him as a \u201cvisionary statesman who represented the social and economic changes of the last years of the 19th century\u201d and the person \u201cresponsible for the changes that were necessary [for Chile] to achieve greater industrial development.\u201d His detractors see him as \u201cthe dictator and tyrant who overrode Chile\u2019s institutional order and was responsible for the civil war.\u201d  Today, while he lost the war and committed suicide, his mixed legacy (Carlos Tromben, who wrote a fictionalized account of Balmaceda, stated in 2016 that he \u201cwent from being hated to being almost a saintly layman\u201d) means that he still has many monuments throughout the country. For example:  - The town of Balmaceda, in the Ays\u00e9n Region. - Avenues (major thoroughfares in Chile) in the cities of Antofagasta, La Serena, Curic\u00f3, San Antonio, Renca (in Santiago), and Temuco. - Balmaceda Park, one of the principal public parks in Santiago.  (Interestingly, Balmaceda Park\u2019s northern terminus is next to Baquedano Plaza, named after Manuel Baquedano, the military general who succeeded Balmaceda as provisional president after Balmaceda sought refuge in the Argentine Embassy).

            " At one point or another, you've probably seen this statue of Leonidas, forever guarding the pass at Thermopylai.jpg).  The statue was funded by Greek Americans, sculpted by Vassos Falireas, and set up in 1955. It stands in a long line of monuments to the Greek defeat at Thermopylai that started the year after the battle and continues to recent times. In 1997, the Greek government added a further monument to celebrate the 700 men of Thespiai who stayed behind and fought to the death with Leonidas.  What are all these people doing, celebrating an unmitigated disaster? Because make no mistake: the battle of Thermopylai was a crushing defeat for the Greek alliance. At minimal loss of troops and time, Xerxes dislodged the Greek army from the strongest position in their land, killing a Spartan king and 4,000 of his men. Leonidas had thrown away his life and that of 300 Spartan citizens, achieving literally nothing. On the face of it, there was no reason for the Greeks to celebrate. Our sources give no hint of the popular idea that the last stand of the 300 Spartans was a moral victory that united and galvanised the Greeks. Herodotos simply refers to the battle as \"the defeat at Thermopylai\" (8.27.1) and \"the defeat of the Spartans\" (8.66.1). Even after the battle, he stresses the constant disappointment of the Athenians at the Spartans' timidity and lack of commitment to the cause (8.40.2, 9.6). Thermopylai was the closest they came to losing the war altogether.  Of course, we know that the Greek allies came back from the brink and eventually defeated the Persians. But this happened in later battles - Salamis, Plataiai and Mykale - with their own separate ancient and modern monuments. The eventual Greek victory against Xerxes doesn't explain why they built all these monuments to their greatest failure.   These monuments started early. Already in Herodotos' day there was a stone lion on the hill where Leonidas fell, and several epigrams to honour the men who fought and died there. Herodotos would have lived long enough to see the tomb of Leonidas that the Spartans built back in Sparta, after they solemnly conveyed his bones home for reburial. Every year they organised a festival and held games in his honour; he was the only Spartan to receive heroic cult. Why all this effort to commemorate defeat?  The answer is simple. Monuments don't immortalise facts; they immortalise heroes. Monuments don't serve historical truth but political agendas.  We have no evidence that the Spartans had a reputation as skilled or courageous fighters before Thermopylai. They didn't tell the kind of stories about themselves that we now tell about the Spartans. But after their defeat at Thermopylai, they badly needed such stories. The rest of the Greeks were stirring; they no longer showed much respect for their supposed hegemon and leader, Sparta, now that it had proved slow and noncommittal and ineffective against the Persian threat. Several states refused to join the fight; others, like Athens, threatened to sail for Italy and leave Greece to its fate. In short, Sparta had fucked up, and desperately needed to change the narrative to show the rest of the Greeks that the Spartans were still worthy to lead them.  So they unleashed what we should probably imagine as a massive propaganda campaign. Through careful management of the information others learned about the battle, the invention of numerous details and prophecies, and by recruiting the legendary poet Simonides of Keos for their cause, they took complete control of the way people remembered Thermopylai. The story of an inexperienced king who led a deliberately understrength force to its pointless destruction was transformed into a heroic narrative of sacrifice for a higher cause. Where the Greeks had accused the Spartans of committing only the bare minimum of troops, the Spartans retorted that none had brought a greater sacrifice: every last one of their men had chosen to stay and die! In fact they had refused to let their allies fight at all, they were so eager to commit themselves to the cause! Their king had fallen bravely in the face of the enemy, in accordance with the eternal laws of Sparta and the oracle that foretold it was the only way to save the rest of Greece! Who would not be inspired by such selfless courage? You know the rest.  Monuments to the bravery of the dead were a crucial part of this propaganda campaign. Simonides' epigrams were set up on the site of the battle so that everyone who passed through would read them. The stone lion for Leonidas made a similar point. Later on, for reasons to do with internal politics at Sparta, the remains of Leonidas were \"found\" and transported back to Sparta for further monumentalisation and celebration. By that time there was no longer much dissent against the official Spartan story of Thermopylai.  Through the centuries, people all over Europe and the wider world have been inspired by that official story. It is, of course, mostly a lie - but one that people find irresistible. They would much rather hear of men stoically embracing their fate and fighting to the death for a higher purpose than of a small rag-tag army ineffectively skirmishing with a vastly superior force over questionable political stakes until they are inevitably overrun and slaughtered. The notion of grimly holding one's ground in the face of impossible odds speaks to our most primal notions of heroism.

            " This is a bit off tangent, but according to John Stockwell in his books Praetorian Guard & In Search of Enemies, the CIA developed a lot of problems common to large bureaucracies and organisations. They've no doubt done some terrible things, and in fact this is the reason why Stockwell left the Agency and testified to Congress about them, but to proscribe complex motives and what sound to me like paranoid conspiracy theories (as opposed to legitimate theories about conspiracies) to them is too much.  That said, returning to topic, the CIA definitely had some role in drug trafficking, and still does if leaks from the Mexican government are to be believed.  Why that is, though, is a rather complex problem to analyse without whistle blowers or proper evidence, of which there is some which I'll list at the end if I can find it.  What I believe, however, is that due to the nature of the Agency, there are a large number of people who constantly find themselves having to justify their work. This is what John Stockwell illustrated; that often, officers would get isolated from their actual responsibilities, by either spending all their time living in similar neighbourhoods to the local ruling classes, or by needing to show why that country needed operations carried out. What I'm trying to say here is that often the motive is incorrect, corrupt or poorly conceived in the first place and therefore not very useful when analysing the action carried out.  If you apply the above rules to Colombia for example, you could imagine CIA agents tasked with monitoring leftists, who live near the villas of Escobar like Cocaine king pins. That means that the advice they get, and the access to government is muddied by these types and they could be led towards facilitating drug trafficking in order to get a better ally against FARC, Unions or Latin American Parliamentary Leftists.  As for reading;  Bob Woodward's book Veil describes in depth the formation of the Contras support in Nicaragua, and although I've only read half of it, I imagine it deals with the Iran Contra affair.

The reason behind this is that they are a chance not only to highlight the history behind the question but one of the major factors we grapple with in the study of history pretty much all across the board: The difficulty of accessing the lives of the people who make up the vast majority of all history: the ordinary people, the farmers, wage laborers, artisans, butchers, bakers and candle stick makers; the poor, the downtrodden, the women, and the slaves \u2013 in short, all the people who were not kings, generals and politicians and who made the whole place hum and work. Questions like what they did for fun, what their aspirations and every day concerns were, how they perceived themselves and the world around them is an immensely interesting subject, especially given that unlike kings, generals, and other \"great man\" figures, they comprise the majority of the people in history.  The problem here and it is a problem that has been famously addressed with the question Can the subaltern speak?, meaning that how do we address writing about people who themselves have left no writing but have only been written about by others. Where we can address them and their perspectives \u2013 such as in the case of *The Cheese and the Worms* or *The Return of Martin Guerre* (if you haven't, check out the book or at least the movie. Seriously, it'll be worth your time) \u2013 the \"I am a ...\" question gives us the chance to share what can be gleaned from these works of scholarship and from the study of the historical perspective of the \"ordinary\" person. Plus, it is immensely refreshing, in my opinion, that through the thick of all the questions about what Adolf Hitler liked to have for breakfast and what he thought about hat fashion, there are questions that take into account that history is more than just the story of men like Hitler, Churchill, Stalin etc.  On the other hand \u2013 and here's where we get to the criticism of these questions \u2013 many who don't like them assert that questions of similar content and with a similar focus could be asked be better and the \"I am a ...\" format always includes both elements of presentism, meaning that they project things we do today back in the past like \"going out with your mates\", and are still pretty limiting, as for example the latest wave of \"hot blooded questions\" for the most part completely left out women of the equation (save a few which have not been upvoted much).  And they are right in their criticism: Many of these questions imply certain behaviors as anthropological in the sense of eternal, natural, and present throughout history as well as again limiting the scope of questions to the historical subjects the asker can imagine while those who are usually not afforded much of a subjectivity in current social narratives are also left out of these questions.  So, indeed, these questions can be formulated and asked better (as can the Hitler questions btw.). At the same time, this is something contributors can address (as has /u/Tiako in the Roman version of this questions that started it all) and is also among the reasons why we as mods would not disallow these questions as we won't disallow the Hitler questions (be warned though, there is a limit to what we are willing to accept in terms of these questions in the name of common decency. \"I'm a member of the Einsatzgruppen. How can I unwind after killing 30.000 Jews?\" will not fly here. Period.)  Our general philosophy in terms of questions is to approach it very light handedly. After all, people are here to have their questions answered and we give questions a lot of leeway, including allowing those with false premises. We are here for education after all and limiting questions heavily to the ones we want to be asked would not really serve that purpose at all.  So, maybe it would be time for us to re-run and/or re-write some tips on how to ask better questions (or as Zhukov put it once to make not-stupid-question not-stupider), including a specific address of these kinds of questions.",

            " Side Question: Were there specific areas that remained relatively stable or were particularly chaotic and disrupted during the period?",
            " Ok great, something in my wheelhouse. The so-called crisis of the third century has six parts. We need to understand each of them, and relations they have with each other, to understand what was going on and how people would have experienced it. Here are the six parts:  1) A changing climate regime. The Roman Empire had grown up in the midst of the Roman Climate Optimum, a time with excellent climate for the Mediterranean agricultural system (focused on three major crops--wheat, grapes, and olives). This allowed Roman culture to spread--wine was grown in England, something that is extremely difficult and rare, and has only recently been replicated due to our increased temperatures. The climate was also quite stable. As a recently published paper on Hellenistic Egypt has shown, stable climates can be associate with less unrest. This changed in the third century, destabilizing the economic base of the empire.  2) Changing disease regime. The Empire experienced its first massive pandemic in the 160s CE, what is known to historians as the Antonine Plague. It was probably smallpox. Some form of fever, possibly something like Ebola, followed in the 250s. This is known as the Plague of Cyprian after the Christian bishops whose letters provide the best evidence for it. These diseases were new, and devastating. The Roman world knew disease, but its diseases were seasonal and local. None reached pandemic scale.   3) Foreign invasion. A resurgent Sasanian Persian Empire sought revenge for past defeats on Rome. The new dynasty was aggressive and defeated several Roman armies. Newly formed confederations along the Rhine and Danube frontier invaded the Empire from the North, and raided as far as Spain.   4) The need for local autonomy in defense led to political fracturing and splinter empires, like the Gallic Empire and the polity based around Palmyra. Local legions who wanted to serve the emperor and local aristocrats who wanted someone to respect their needs started raising their own emperors. This led to civil war. This was especially bad in the two decades between 250 and 270, which can be seen as the heart of the crisis.   5) Spiritual breakdown followed as the systems that upheld the authority of the emperors collapsed. Who thinks that the emperor is divine when they keep getting killed? Who thinks the gods care when there is no rain and terrible new diseases come. Christianity rises in popularity, but is blamed by many for causing the crisis. In the 250s, the first systematic persecution of Christians begins. This has the paradoxical effect of strengthening Christian communities, which had already begun to gain attention by the charity work they were doing in the cities. The persecutions are just enough of a threat to make christianity stronger but not enough to kill it off.   6) There is a revolution. Rome had for a long time been ruled by an alliance of the Senatorial aristocracy of Italy and the urban elites of the Eastern Mediterranean. This collapses as it turns out that these guys aren't particularly good at what they do. More and more power falls into the hands of the army, and especially the officer core, which is primarily dominated by tough Balkan soldiers. People like Aurelian, Diocletian, Constantine, and a bunch of dudes whose names start with Max- of Cons-. This continues all the way up through Justinian. From Diocletian to Justinian, 82% of the years of the Empire the Emperor was of Balkan stock. They reorganized the state to defend their homelands.   So how does this make people feel? Well, it depends where you are. If you are in a major city you are primarily concerned with barbarian invasion and pandemic disease. We know that in the 270s the first walls go up at Rome in hundreds of years--the so-called Aurelian Wall. We have to remember that at this point Rome has a population of ballpark a million, which is huge. It relies on the Empire to feed it, so any disruption to the systems that brought in the grain from Egypt would have been terrifying, and the arrival of the grain fleet every year was marked by huge celebrations. Much of the importance of the city was changing in this period, however, and fewer and fewer emperors would have spent less and less time there. The centers of action were elsewhere, but if you lived in the city of Rome you would have still thought you lived in the center of the world and the local politics--senators vying for local office, disputed election for the bishop of Rome--would have taken up a lot of your attention. Many times you wouldn't be aware that someone new had been created emperor because by the time they started minting coinage and it got to you they would already have been killed. In general, it would have been bad--but the really bad years were basically 240-270, and that is both long enough for things to get really bad and long enough to get used to it. In cities that weren't Rome, the crisis meant that many cities that were artificial and supported by elites who wanted to play at urbanity for cultural reasons would have disappeared. Walls were built all across the empire, sometimes in great haste and sometimes with great care, but always surrounding small areas of what had once big large cities. The urban fabric shrinks.   If you are in the countryside you might care less about disease (smallpox, e.g., is hard to transmit unless you have crowds) but the climate instability would threaten you, as would the armies (both Roman and 'barbarian' that ravaged the countryside). If you were an elite, you basically worried about getting caught up in power politics and getting killed. Huge numbers of Senatorial families go extinct around this time. If you are a Christian, you worry about martyrdom--but, perhaps, you also seek it. It is a crown to be won, an athletic contest for the ages, you against Satan and the torturers of the Roman state. Basically, it is extremely difficult to generalize, other than to say that it was a period of intense dread. We can see this especially in the ideology of the restored government of the Tetrarchy. Coins bear inscription like \"securitas rei publicae\" (national security). Panegyric speeches talk about how peasants saw soldiers coming and were terrified, but then realized it was the legitimate emperor and ran to greet him, thanking the gods (the speeches I'm thinking of are from the 290s, so traditional Roman gods still play a role).   We can get another sense of how people felt from the letters of Cyprian.

In winter, there is not enough rain to nourish the seeds. In summer the warmth that usually roasts the crops is gone. Nor are the springs so joyful in their temperateness, nor the autumns\u2019 trees so fertile in fruit. Fewer casings of marble are ripped from the exhausted, worn-out hills. The mines have already been emptied: they bring forth less and less gold and silver, as the poor veins grow poorer with every passing day. Farmers dwindle and disappear from the fields, sailors from the sea, soldiers from their encampments, innocence from the marketplace, justice from the courtroom, harmony from friendship, skill from industry, discipline from morals... \"...The wars continue unceasingly, our anxiety is doubled by bad harvests and famine; our strength is broken by raging disease, the human race is devastated by the decimation of the plague...\" \" ... And in your contempt and stubbornness, you wonder and complain that the rain falls rarely, that the land is blighted by dust, that the exhausted soil scarcely produces a stringy shoot of wheat, that the driving hail mutilates the vine, that the hurricane uproots the olive tree, that drought stills the source, and a pestilent breeze corrupts the air and a great disease rots away at mankind.\" \"...On all sides they scramble, they steal, they grab: there is no disguise for crime, no hesitation. Each man rushes out to rob, as if it were legal, as if it were obligatory, as if anyone who did not pillage were provoking his own loss and expense.\"  Now of course Cyprian has his biases, but it gives some sense of what it was like.

        "sft_target": " Ok great, something in my wheelhouse. The so-called crisis of the third century has six parts. We need to understand each of them, and relations they have with each other, to understand what was going on and how people would have experienced it. Here are the six parts:  1) A changing climate regime. The Roman Empire had grown up in the midst of the Roman Climate Optimum, a time with excellent climate for the Mediterranean agricultural system (focused on three major crops--wheat, grapes, and olives). This allowed Roman culture to spread--wine was grown in England, something that is extremely difficult and rare, and has only recently been replicated due to our increased temperatures. The climate was also quite stable. As a recently published paper on Hellenistic Egypt has shown, stable climates can be associate with less unrest. This changed in the third century, destabilizing the economic base of the empire.  2) Changing disease regime. The Empire experienced its first massive pandemic in the 160s CE, what is known to historians as the Antonine Plague. It was probably smallpox. Some form of fever, possibly something like Ebola, followed in the 250s. This is known as the Plague of Cyprian after the Christian bishops whose letters provide the best evidence for it. These diseases were new, and devastating. The Roman world knew disease, but its diseases were seasonal and local. None reached pandemic scale.   3) Foreign invasion. A resurgent Sasanian Persian Empire sought revenge for past defeats on Rome. The new dynasty was aggressive and defeated several Roman armies. Newly formed confederations along the Rhine and Danube frontier invaded the Empire from the North, and raided as far as Spain.   4) The need for local autonomy in defense led to political fracturing and splinter empires, like the Gallic Empire and the polity based around Palmyra. Local legions who wanted to serve the emperor and local aristocrats who wanted someone to respect their needs started raising their own emperors. This led to civil war. This was especially bad in the two decades between 250 and 270, which can be seen as the heart of the crisis.   5) Spiritual breakdown followed as the systems that upheld the authority of the emperors collapsed. Who thinks that the emperor is divine when they keep getting killed? Who thinks the gods care when there is no rain and terrible new diseases come. Christianity rises in popularity, but is blamed by many for causing the crisis. In the 250s, the first systematic persecution of Christians begins. This has the paradoxical effect of strengthening Christian communities, which had already begun to gain attention by the charity work they were doing in the cities. The persecutions are just enough of a threat to make christianity stronger but not enough to kill it off.   6) There is a revolution. Rome had for a long time been ruled by an alliance of the Senatorial aristocracy of Italy and the urban elites of the Eastern Mediterranean. This collapses as it turns out that these guys aren't particularly good at what they do. More and more power falls into the hands of the army, and especially the officer core, which is primarily dominated by tough Balkan soldiers. People like Aurelian, Diocletian, Constantine, and a bunch of dudes whose names start with Max- of Cons-. This continues all the way up through Justinian. From Diocletian to Justinian, 82% of the years of the Empire the Emperor was of Balkan stock. They reorganized the state to defend their homelands.   So how does this make people feel? Well, it depends where you are. If you are in a major city you are primarily concerned with barbarian invasion and pandemic disease. We know that in the 270s the first walls go up at Rome in hundreds of years--the so-called Aurelian Wall. We have to remember that at this point Rome has a population of ballpark a million, which is huge. It relies on the Empire to feed it, so any disruption to the systems that brought in the grain from Egypt would have been terrifying, and the arrival of the grain fleet every year was marked by huge celebrations. Much of the importance of the city was changing in this period, however, and fewer and fewer emperors would have spent less and less time there. The centers of action were elsewhere, but if you lived in the city of Rome you would have still thought you lived in the center of the world and the local politics--senators vying for local office, disputed election for the bishop of Rome--would have taken up a lot of your attention. Many times you wouldn't be aware that someone new had been created emperor because by the time they started minting coinage and it got to you they would already have been killed. In general, it would have been bad--but the really bad years were basically 240-270, and that is both long enough for things to get really bad and long enough to get used to it. In cities that weren't Rome, the crisis meant that many cities that were artificial and supported by elites who wanted to play at urbanity for cultural reasons would have disappeared. Walls were built all across the empire, sometimes in great haste and sometimes with great care, but always surrounding small areas of what had once big large cities. The urban fabric shrinks.   If you are in the countryside you might care less about disease (smallpox, e.g., is hard to transmit unless you have crowds) but the climate instability would threaten you, as would the armies (both Roman and 'barbarian' that ravaged the countryside). If you were an elite, you basically worried about getting caught up in power politics and getting killed. Huge numbers of Senatorial families go extinct around this time. If you are a Christian, you worry about martyrdom--but, perhaps, you also seek it. It is a crown to be won, an athletic contest for the ages, you against Satan and the torturers of the Roman state. Basically, it is extremely difficult to generalize, other than to say that it was a period of intense dread. We can see this especially in the ideology of the restored government of the Tetrarchy. Coins bear inscription like \"securitas rei publicae\" (national security). Panegyric speeches talk about how peasants saw soldiers coming and were terrified, but then realized it was the legitimate emperor and ran to greet him, thanking the gods (the speeches I'm thinking of are from the 290s, so traditional Roman gods still play a role).   We can get another sense of how people felt from the letters of Cyprian. Here he is talking about the weather and other things, in a letter from 252 CE:   \u201c Now the world itself speaks and, by the proof of skidding events, testifies to its own decline.

            " \"The age of cannons and sails and pirates\" is pretty broad, but I think we can fairly say that between a period of say 1650 or so and 1805 or so, naval battles were often quite lethal to the people involved. The caveat here of course is that the tactics used and the motivation of the people involved ebbed and flowed over time, and so there's not really a straight line we can draw among different encounters.   Just to set our parameters: I'm picking 1650ish to bound this on the early end because the first Anglo-Dutch war started in 1652, and the three conflicts (1652-54, 1665-67 and 1672-74) saw the development and codification of what we generally refer to as line-of-battle tactics for fleet engagements.   I'm picking 1805 as the bound on the other end because, of course, the battle of Trafalgar saw a complete abandonment of those tactics and a decisive victory for Britain.   The Anglo-Dutch wars saw the first widespread use of the line-of-battle tactic that would dominate naval tactics for the next 150 years or so. The exact origin of the idea that you would line up ships front to rear and engage the enemy's line arranged in the same way is pretty well disputed -- some people trace this back to 1500, others say that Maarten Tromp used the tactic in 1639 -- but for our purposes that's kind of a moot point, because the line-of-battle tactics used in the Anglo-Dutch wars often produced long-running engagements, many of which resulted in simple mutual exhaustion on both sides. If both sides kept to a strict line, engagements usually ran a fairly regular course of the ships passing one another and firing away until one fleet edged away, enough ships were damaged that the rest tried to flee, or darkness fell and one side broke off the battle.   If that didn't happen, though, and a line became disordered due to damage, lack of leadership, flaws in weather, etc., the battle could turn quite quickly in favor of one side or the other. The Four Days' Battle is probably a good and also bad example of this -- it's quite unusual in being the largest battle of the Age of Sail, though it's not well known, and resulted in a decisive English defeat in the second Anglo-Dutch war.   It was fought from 11-14 June 1666 (New Style) with 54 ships on the English side against 84 on the Dutch side. The English, commanded by George Monck (the duke of Albemarle) decided to attack the numerically superior Dutch fleet commanded by Michiel de Ruyter in hopes of defeating them in detail before the Dutch could combine. In the event, on the first day Albermarle did not double up or fall on a portion of the Dutch fleet but fought a conventional battle at range, to his disadvantage.   On the second day, the ships again formed lines but seem to have quite often cut through one line or the other to attempt to engage with some numerical superiority; the English fleet suffered heavily in this encounter. Admiral de Ruyter's ship was badly damaged and he withdrew from the fighting, but at the end of the day the English fleet was reduced to only 29 ships that were battle-worthy. Albermarle decided to withdraw to the west, and on the third day the Dutch fleet gave chase but stayed out of range, fearing the large English stern-chasers. Albermale's course took the fleet over the Galloper shoal, and several ships grounded, including Admiral George Ayscue's *Prince Royal*; his men, panicking, forced him to surrender the ship. He was, and remains, the highest-ranking English naval officer to have been captured by an enemy.   On the fourth day, the English fleet received some reinforcements, including fireships, and decided to attack the Dutch fleet. Both sides realized that this might be the decisive battle of the war. The English attacked from leeward, in an unfortunate position for a sea-fight, and the Dutch fleet was able to encircle and overwhelm them. Sir Christopher Myngs, taking over as admiral of the van from Ayscue, was shot with a musket-ball and fatally wounded; with the van falling into disarray, de Ruyter attacked Albermale's squadron directly and forced him to retreat into a fog bank.   Both fleets took fairly heavy damage, but the English had the worse, with about 1,500 men killed, 1,500 or so wounded, and 1,800 captured (many of whom served in the Dutch fleet later). The Dutch lost about 1,500 killed and 1,300 wounded, but had the tactical and strategic victory.   What happened between the Anglo-Dutch wars and the Napoleonic period is a time where there was a bit of tactical indecisiveness, not to say outright cowardice, on the part of the British. The battle of Minorca is a good example -- evenly matched British and French fleets fought an indecisive battle, with 38 killed and 150 or so wounded on the British side and 45/160 on the French, after which the British held a council of war and decided to withdraw. This led to John Byng being convicted of cowardice and shot; after which British captains and admirals had a much stronger motivation to seek decisive battle.   I wrote about the battle of Quiberon Bay here before, which I'll c-p below:   > This is exactly what British admiral Sir Edward Hawke did in 1759: the bulk of his fleet lay off the northwest of Ushant, with two small ships of the line under Augustus Hervey anchored off the Black Rocks at the Iroise watching the Goulet. His ships were often blown off station, but a westerly wind usually meant that the French were bottled up in port even as the British ships were blown off blockade.  >The reason for keeping the French fleet in port was that the French, growing desperate at their losses in the Americas, had decided in 1758 upon an invasion of Britain. The invasion fleet was assembling in Vannes, in the west of France, while the battle fleet was at Brest (at the time, there were only sketchy land communications with Brest -- it relied on coastal shipping for nearly everything, and an army couldn't assemble there). The fleet would have to break out of Brest, sail to Vannes to pick up the transports, and then evade the British fleet to land troops somewhere in Britain, which was a tall order.  >The French were increasingly desperate to break out of port as 1759 drew to a close, and when a westerly gale blew Hawke off station in November, the French acted. The same day that the storm died down and Hawke left Torbay, the French left Brest. They were blown far to the west before they could come about and head for Vannes, and had trouble with the fleet because many of its men were inexperienced at sea after being bottled up in port. They sailed for Quiberon Bay, where the transports waited, with the British fleet on their heels, and made it almost there before sighting the British fleet. The French gambled that the British would not follow them into Quiberon Bay, because the British lacked charts of the area, but Hawke attacked at once and the French fleet fled. The British caught up with the tail end of the French fleet just as the van was entering the bay, and at that point the wind backed and headed the French, as well as kicking up an extremely rough sea.  >The battle was a disaster for the French; the Thesee sank attempting to open its lower gunports (the ship flooded) and the Superbe sank after two broadsides from Hawke's flagship. One French ship was captured; three were trapped in the Vilaine river with their guns thrown overboard to lighten ship; and six were wrecked or sunk. Two British ships were also driven ashore and wrecked, but their crews were rescued.  British casualties were about 400 men killed, against French of 2,500 lost in battle and/or drowned.   The best-known battles of the age of sail, of course, were Nelson's three victories at the Nile, Copenhagen, and Trafalgar. I've written about the Nile here and Trafalgar here -- casualties in both battles were quite high.   Of course, that doesn't also mean there were engagements with fewer! The famous action between *HMS Speedy* and the Spanish ship *Gamo* ended with the British losing three killed and nine wounded, in capturing a much larger ship with 14 killed and 41 wounded (more men than were on board *Speedy*).   I'm going to need to stop here for now, but I will come back later and expand!",
            " Not so much about pirates but one of the innovations of Admiral Nelson was the introduction of deliberate chaos into naval warfare with an aim at being spectacularly lethal. The battle of Trafalgar, and similar actions, saw the British outkill their enemies by a ratio of 10 to 1 or more. I can't speak as much to pirates except by a bit of extrapolation but clashes between naval armed forces could be highly lethal.  This \"innovation\" came about for a variety of reasons, some practical and some cultural, but prior to Nelson and commanders like him the accepted method had been for two fleets to approach each other in an orderly fashion, maneuver to get a wind advantage, and then, at the direction of the admiral, engage with an aim toward capturing enemy ships. Crews, captains, and admirals all got a share of the value of captured ships so destroying the enemy wasn't exactly the highest priority if you could avoid doing so. Furthermore, \"not losing\" was more important than \"winning\", per se.  All this began to change in the early to mid 1700s but the tipping point is really probably in 1757 when the British shoot an admiral for cowardice. Admiral Byng came from a long line of British seamen and was the equivalent of the royalty of the British Navy. However, he made a fatal miscalculation off Minorca by not closing with a French fleet that outnumbered and outgunned him, despite the fact that he had the wind advantage. There'd been a fierce debate about changing sea tactics for a while but the Admiralty ended up court-martialing him, convicting him, and then denying some very high-level pleas for mercy before having him executed by firing squad. If you could shoot an admiral with close connections to royalty, a family history of naval service, and a lifetime of service of his own then NO ONE was getting a pass. Nelson was born a year later and came up through the ranks of a Royal Navy with a very different ethos.  Nelson really came into his own at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent, where he took his 74 gun ship, disobeyed direct orders, and attacked three Spanish ships with a total of 322 guns. Ultimately he fought until all four ships were badly damaged, then stormed one of the Spanish ships with a boarding party. This was \\*not how things were done\\* and it threw the Spanish for a complete loop. The battle was a huge British victory but the Royal Navy didn't want to reward Nelson for disobeying orders so he didn't get shot but he didn't get promoted either. Privately, his superiors realized he had a visionary approach to cataclysmic killing.  Nelson would refine this over the course of his career and as he became more and more of a hero to the British public he began to draw people to his way of thinking. His crews were close-knit and fiercely personally loyal (partially due to the fact that the British navy was a pretty strict meritocracy in which everyone started at the bottom, albeit sometimes with advantages, and worked their way up). He encouraged constant training on firing so that his crews could fire much more quickly than their counterparts, even if it meant dry firing due to the Admiralty not giving them powder allocations for training, and often bought supplemental powder to train his gun crews. His captains, as he rose through the ranks, were disciples of this approach. This was coupled with the rise of the Romantic movement in Europe, particularly in Britain, which saw a societal fascination with purifying nature cataclysmic violence and a hearkening back to Britain's Romantic past.  At Trafalgar, Nelson's famous signal was \"England expects that every man will do his duty\"; it is worth noting that he first ordered \"confides\" instead of \"expects\" but that would have had to have been spelled out and there was a single flag for \"expects\", which saved considerable time as battle approached. This encapsulates his philosophy almost perfectly.  He chose England, the realm of Richard the Lionheart and King Arthur, over \"Britain\", \"every man\" from the captains to the powder monkeys, and \"confides\" instead of \"demands\" or \"orders\". The effect is something akin to \"your countrymen back home, your families and towns, your King and Parliament, are confident that each and every one of you will carry the fate of the nation in your hands today\". Instead of approaching in an orderly line alongside the Spanish and French fleets, he hit them perpendicularly in the center of their line and the rest, effectively, is history.  To return to the extrapolation a bit, pirates would have lacked a lot of these motivations- they weren't in a national service and they were fighting primarily for plunder so they'd like their opponents to surrender with as little damage to the valuable ships as possible. They likely didn't have the same standards of discipline and didn't train as often (although this isn't a universal by any means).  You might check out \"Seize the Fire: Heroism, Duty, and the Battle of Trafalgar\" by Adam Nicolson for a quick, easy, but thorough overview of how, why, and when all these things changed.",

What happened between the Anglo-Dutch wars and the Napoleonic period is a time where there was a bit of tactical indecisiveness, not to say outright cowardice, on the part of the British. The battle of Minorca is a good example -- evenly matched British and French fleets fought an indecisive battle, with 38 killed and 150 or so wounded on the British side and 45/160 on the French, after which the British held a council of war and decided to withdraw. This led to John Byng being convicted of cowardice and shot; after which British captains and admirals had a much stronger motivation to seek decisive battle.   I wrote about the battle of Quiberon Bay here before, which I'll c-p below:   > This is exactly what British admiral Sir Edward Hawke did in 1759: the bulk of his fleet lay off the northwest of Ushant, with two small ships of the line under Augustus Hervey anchored off the Black Rocks at the Iroise watching the Goulet.

The best-known battles of the age of sail, of course, were Nelson's three victories at the Nile, Copenhagen, and Trafalgar.

            " \"The age of cannons and sails and pirates\" is pretty broad, but I think we can fairly say that between a period of say 1650 or so and 1805 or so, naval battles were often quite lethal to the people involved. The caveat here of course is that the tactics used and the motivation of the people involved ebbed and flowed over time, and so there's not really a straight line we can draw among different encounters.   Just to set our parameters: I'm picking 1650ish to bound this on the early end because the first Anglo-Dutch war started in 1652, and the three conflicts (1652-54, 1665-67 and 1672-74) saw the development and codification of what we generally refer to as line-of-battle tactics for fleet engagements.   I'm picking 1805 as the bound on the other end because, of course, the battle of Trafalgar saw a complete abandonment of those tactics and a decisive victory for Britain.   The Anglo-Dutch wars saw the first widespread use of the line-of-battle tactic that would dominate naval tactics for the next 150 years or so. The exact origin of the idea that you would line up ships front to rear and engage the enemy's line arranged in the same way is pretty well disputed -- some people trace this back to 1500, others say that Maarten Tromp used the tactic in 1639 -- but for our purposes that's kind of a moot point, because the line-of-battle tactics used in the Anglo-Dutch wars often produced long-running engagements, many of which resulted in simple mutual exhaustion on both sides. If both sides kept to a strict line, engagements usually ran a fairly regular course of the ships passing one another and firing away until one fleet edged away, enough ships were damaged that the rest tried to flee, or darkness fell and one side broke off the battle.   If that didn't happen, though, and a line became disordered due to damage, lack of leadership, flaws in weather, etc., the battle could turn quite quickly in favor of one side or the other. The Four Days' Battle is probably a good and also bad example of this -- it's quite unusual in being the largest battle of the Age of Sail, though it's not well known, and resulted in a decisive English defeat in the second Anglo-Dutch war.   It was fought from 11-14 June 1666 (New Style) with 54 ships on the English side against 84 on the Dutch side. The English, commanded by George Monck (the duke of Albemarle) decided to attack the numerically superior Dutch fleet commanded by Michiel de Ruyter in hopes of defeating them in detail before the Dutch could combine. In the event, on the first day Albermarle did not double up or fall on a portion of the Dutch fleet but fought a conventional battle at range, to his disadvantage.   On the second day, the ships again formed lines but seem to have quite often cut through one line or the other to attempt to engage with some numerical superiority; the English fleet suffered heavily in this encounter. Admiral de Ruyter's ship was badly damaged and he withdrew from the fighting, but at the end of the day the English fleet was reduced to only 29 ships that were battle-worthy. Albermarle decided to withdraw to the west, and on the third day the Dutch fleet gave chase but stayed out of range, fearing the large English stern-chasers. Albermale's course took the fleet over the Galloper shoal, and several ships grounded, including Admiral George Ayscue's *Prince Royal*; his men, panicking, forced him to surrender the ship. He was, and remains, the highest-ranking English naval officer to have been captured by an enemy.   On the fourth day, the English fleet received some reinforcements, including fireships, and decided to attack the Dutch fleet. Both sides realized that this might be the decisive battle of the war. The English attacked from leeward, in an unfortunate position for a sea-fight, and the Dutch fleet was able to encircle and overwhelm them. Sir Christopher Myngs, taking over as admiral of the van from Ayscue, was shot with a musket-ball and fatally wounded; with the van falling into disarray, de Ruyter attacked Albermale's squadron directly and forced him to retreat into a fog bank.   Both fleets took fairly heavy damage, but the English had the worse, with about 1,500 men killed, 1,500 or so wounded, and 1,800 captured (many of whom served in the Dutch fleet later). The Dutch lost about 1,500 killed and 1,300 wounded, but had the tactical and strategic victory.

            " I\u2019m not a historian of the era, but a fan. Also British, so sorry for the bias in my knowledge.  The era you are talking about really fits between the late 16th century, and the early to mid 19th century. Prior to this era, the battles concerned themselves with trying to board the other vessels, hence the Spanish Galleons that typified the time had very high fore- and aft-castles, to gain the high ground, so to speak. This era ended with the introduction of steel armoured ships (The French Gloire being the first in 1859), and gun turrets (USS Monitor - 1862) rather than broadsides.  In the late 15th century, Britain developed a compact gun carriage, It invention is sometimes attributed to Henry VIII. This is the type of gun carriage you see in historic vessels, and on shows like Hornblower. Prior to this Field guns, with large wheel carriages were install on ships. The smaller carriages meant that the guns could recoil further, allowing for larger calibres and much faster reload speeds.  The efficacy of this invention was demonstrated during the Spanish Armada, with the Spanish still using the old field gun carriages, and the English using the new compact carriages. One pitch battles, where the English lost no ships to combat (8 fire ships to burn the Spanish out of port to actually fight them).  The Spanish lost over 600 dead in the battle of Gravelines plus 800 wounded (out of 7000 sailors and 17000 soldiers). 5 ships were sunk, but most of the Spanish fleet was severely damaged. If they had been modern warships with that much damage they\u2019d have sunk, but fundamentally wood floats. Overall the Spanish lost c.20,000 of 24,000 on that campaign, mostly lost to the high seas taking the long way back over the top of Scotland and Ireland. The English lost only a maximum of 100 to combat (6-8000 to disease chasing the Spanish over the top.) From the dead in the battle at least it shows that the new carriage was 6x more lethal.  This was a bit of a theme from pitch battles at the time, the tail of the butchers bill was usually higher then the bill during combat, as badly damaged ships succumbed to high seas, or crew fell ill in foetid conditions.  Thus during this era, naval battle was global, and a lot of the skills centered around navigation and being able to bring your guns to bear. Hear generally the English, then British, excelled as the song would have it \u201cBritannia rules the waves\u201d. They employed frigates as the were faster, and more manouverable, and more that a match for a merchant ship. Generally if they were unlucky enough to be cornered by a ship of the line, they\u2019d be annihilated.  Naval Warfare at the time would then more usually be between a ship of the line and two or three frigates. They could last several days, mostly with the frigates chasing down the ship of the line or merchantman. The conquering ships generally did not want to destroy the conquered ship, as it would be very valuable in price money, as the royal navy would essentially buy the captured ship of the crew that captured it. For an able seaman or petty officer, this could be enough to retire, if a frigate managed to capture a merchantman. Thus the battles were deadly but generally not lethal, as the target was to get them to surrender. Navy\u2019s would have been spread quite thin, trying to cover global interests.  The other notable pitch battle then is right at the end of this era. The battle of Trafalgar. This was a decisive moment in the Napoleonic war. It prevented a French invasion of Britain, and effectively removed the French navy as any kind of force for decades. As an aside to the prize money aspect. The French were exceeding good at building ships, but rubbish at sailing them. And over half of the British Navy at the battle were French made ships, previously captured and pressed into service for the Royal Navy.  The total compliment (Sailing crew, gun crews, officers and marines) for the would have been of the order of 13,000-20,000 (I can\u2019t find the exact number, but Nelson\u2019s flagship Victory had a compliment of 850 for scale, there were 2-3 ships which were larger than the Victory).  Casualties were relatively high due to Nelson\u2019s tactics of sailing his ships straight at the French/Spanish line. A particularly vulnerable thing to do, as they\u2019d be sailing directly into the enemy broadside for over an hour before they would retaliate. The ships in the vanguard of the two columns bore the brunt of this, particularly in the leeward (down-wind) column which was the engaged the French sooner (thus forcing them to disengage from the windward column allowing them final approach relatively unmolested.)  None the less the leading ships took c. 20% casualties. (there is a great chart on Wikipedia of casualty rates on each ship). Most of the windward column suffered less than 10% casualties. The French and Spanish navies suffered much higher casualties. With Redoutable suffering 90% casualties.  In the end there were 458 British dead (<5%) and c3,300 French and Spanish dead (c. 15%), and double that again wounded on each side. Only 5 of the combined navy ships returned to sea, out of 41. 21 further ships were captured by the British. Only one ship was actually destroyed (the Redoutable was scuttled, due to extensive damage sustained). Another 3000 men were lost in a storm after the battle.  This is one of the most decisive and bloody battles in naval history prior to WW2 in the Pacific. Nelson\u2019s sole intent was to remove the French navy as an effective force, and he was willing to throw as many men as necessary at that goal. Nelson and Gravina (the Spanish C-in-C) were both killed in action. Compare this with the total annihilation of Hannibal by the Romans to achieve the same goal.  On casualty rates, these would include crew injured and wounded. The primary cause of injury, fatal or otherwise, were splinters, as cannon balls smashed through the hulls, they\u2019d shower the lower decks with splinters, some as big as your forearm. These left horrific injuries, often requiring amputation of limbs in order to have a clean wound to cauterise and sew shut. A lot of the fatalities would have been men who bleed out before they saw the surgeon, and few would have died instantly. The caricature of eye patch and peg leg was not too far removed from reality, though generally in sovereign navies only officers could afford to not have all limbs, some crew men could serve effectively whilst dismembered, but most would be discharged.  Still, set piece battles like this were still extremely rare. The only other battle of the same scale as the battle of Trafalgar during Nelson\u2019s era was the Battle of the Nile, whereas Wellington, in the same wars fought dozens of battles. Most of naval life was taken up with the business of sailing, and skirmishes between 2-4 ships would have been much more common. In these example, the ships with the upper hand would have been fairly obvious at any point, and when the position finally became untenable the weaker ship would usually capitulate if the fight was between two countries. More sailors were lost to disease and the high seas.   Against outright pirates, they usually fought to the death, because it was less horrific to die to a sword then 1000 lashes, or keel hauling, the usual punishments for pirates. Some pirates crew men might be pressed into service within the sovereign navies.  There is a further category of ships. Privateers. These were pirates who had been given Letters of Marque by a country. Essentially commissions in those countries navies\u2019 to capture and harass trade shipping of foreign powers, on their own dime. They would do this for the prize money, which as mentioned, could be substantial. They were theoretically offered the same protections as crew and officers from those sovereign navies, but often were not worth the paper they were written on if captured"

Only 5 of the combined navy ships returned to sea, out of 41. 21 further ships were captured by the British. Only one ship was actually destroyed (the Redoutable was scuttled, due to extensive damage sustained). Another 3000 men were lost in a storm after the battle.  This is one of the most decisive and bloody battles in naval history prior to WW2 in the Pacific. Nelson\u2019s sole intent was to remove the French navy as an effective force, and he was willing to throw as many men as necessary at that goal. Nelson and Gravina (the Spanish C-in-C) were both killed in action. Compare this with the total annihilation of Hannibal by the Romans to achieve the same goal.  On casualty rates, these would include crew injured and wounded. The primary cause of injury, fatal or otherwise, were splinters, as cannon balls smashed through the hulls, they\u2019d shower the lower decks with splinters, some as big as your forearm. These left horrific injuries, often requiring amputation of limbs in order to have a clean wound to cauterise and sew shut. A lot of the fatalities would have been men who bleed out before they saw the surgeon, and few would have died instantly. The caricature of eye patch and peg leg was not too far removed from reality, though generally in sovereign navies only officers could afford to not have all limbs, some crew men could serve effectively whilst dismembered, but most would be discharged.  Still, set piece battles like this were still extremely rare. The only other battle of the same scale as the battle of Trafalgar during Nelson\u2019s era was the Battle of the Nile, whereas Wellington, in the same wars fought dozens of battles. Most of naval life was taken up with the business of sailing, and skirmishes between 2-4 ships would have been much more common. In these example, the ships with the upper hand would have been fairly obvious at any point, and when the position finally became untenable the weaker ship would usually capitulate if the fight was between two countries. More sailors were lost to disease and the high seas.   Against outright pirates, they usually fought to the death, because it was less horrific to die to a sword then 1000 lashes, or keel hauling, the usual punishments for pirates. Some pirates crew men might be pressed into service within the sovereign navies.  There is a further category of ships. Privateers. These were pirates who had been given Letters of Marque by a country. Essentially commissions in those countries navies\u2019 to capture and harass trade shipping of foreign powers, on their own dime. They would do this for the prize money, which as mentioned, could be substantial. They were theoretically offered the same protections as crew and officers from those sovereign navies, but often were not worth the paper they were written on if captured"

            " Waco was a siege that lasted over a month (Feb. 28-April 19. 1993) by Federal agencies after The Branch Davidians religious group lead by David Koresh was reported to be stockpiling weapons and an affidavit was provided corroborating the story. There was other issues that had arisen as well, such as claims of sexual abuse, the fact that the group had ex-convicts within (ex-druggies) and National Guard overhead flybys revealed a hotspot that was believed to be a meth lab.  Most of the sexual abuse charges (especially against the children) hadn't been proven prior to the attack (although, there was testimony to support it). Also, the Davidians had proper paperwork on all their weapons, including a member of the compound who had a federal license to deal firearms. Local law enforcement was on good terms with the Mount Carmel community and the Sherriff even advocated that the agencies go talk with them.  When the ATF and the other agencies rolled up, they were armed to the teeth and no one is quiet sure who fired the first shot. The scenes of the government agencies hitting the compound with floodlights and using loudspeakers to bombard them with noise is all documented fact. The final assault on the compound wasn't simply a martyrdom though, as the Branch Davidians fought their attackers. The use of military grade smoke grenades was approved for the final assault, partly because of reports of child abuse going on in the compound (which the FBI Hostage Rescue Team later denied that there was any signs of abuse on the children).  What the show doesn't show (besides the final gunbattle), was that David Koresh, when he originally called the police, began a bibical rant that left the police dispatcher confused on what he was even talking about. According to government autopsies performed, at least 20 of the 76 who died on April 19 were either mercy killed or murdered by other Branch Davidians.  The show is reasonable accurate and doesn't try to go out of it's way to be horribly inaccurate like other shows on historical topics. The problem with Waco, and trying to depict it, is that it's hard to make a very balanced show on it. You either have *In the Line of Duty: Ambush in Waco,* in which the film writer, Phil Penningroth claims to be pro-ATF \"propaganda\" or Alex Jones's \"*America Wake Up (Or Waco)*\" which is all about Waco being a governmental conspiracy. It's usually either pro or anti-government and it's been difficult for some reason to give a middle ground.  Much of the problem has to do with just how controversial the whole situation is, and there isn't even consensus on the evidence. Some independent investigators after the Siege were pretty certain the ATF, National Guard and FBI had actually tampered with the area to bury much of the evidence of wrong-doing, while the image of a M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle taking part on the assault on the final day has been debated whether it had a flame thrower attached to it and if they ran over a Branch Davidian and dragged their body under the vehicle's tires. There is also the issues of the fires themselves. The government claims that those in the compound started the fires but those Branch Davidians that escaped not only deny they started it, but blame the attackers as purposefully starting the fires to burn them out.  It's a messy tragedy that we'll never know the full truth of what happened, no matter how accurately a show tries to portray it.  Edit 1: I have been asked about what exactly is \"military grade tear gas\". I did address it as a response but those who want to know: The closest I can find to what exactly would qualify as \"military grade\", as what I've read on Waco called it, is that there are 3 grades of tear gas, CN, CS and CR. CS is the one most law enforcement uses and CR, which is probably the military grade, is known to be between 6 to 10 times more powerful, and can kill within minutes in a poorly ventilated room.",
            " From what I remember watching the series a few months ago, the series made it seem like Koresh created the Branch Davidians without delving into the fact that it was started by a man named Victor Houteff in 1930. They made it seem like \"Davidian\" was related to \"David\" Koresh himself. Gary Noesner, portrayed by Michael Shannon wasn't involved the entire time, only the first 25 days. Authorities didn't raze the area after the siege, in actuality parts of Mount Carmel compound are still standing today.   Other than those small details the series is actually pretty accurate. The Guardian called it \u201cre-enactment rather than dramatization, presenting these characters and images without developing them beyond their factual bullet points.\u201d A writer for Forbes said it \u201cultimately suffers from feeling more like a history lesson than a drama.\u201d And The New York Times said it was \u201ca workmanlike summary of events that paints a largely, some say excessively, sympathetic portrait of Koresh and his followers.\u201d  The filmmakers based the series on a pair of books by participants from inside and out of the siege \u2014  Noesner\u2019s 2010 Stalling for Time: My Life as an FBI Hostage Negotiator and the 1999 A Place Called Waco: A Survivor\u2019s Story by David Thibodeau, one of nine Branch Davidian survivors. Thibodeau had this to say about the series: \u201cThey gassed kids to death, and they have the gall to say it was all David Koresh\u2019s fault? They gassed the kids to death. American law enforcement officers gassed American children to death. They went to the structure where the kids were and put so much tear gas in there that they anesthetized all the mothers and children in that little concrete structure. Most young men with good physiques could not have gotten out of that situation. What happened was not fair, and worse, the way it has been portrayed is not historically accurate.\u201d  The series doesn't shy away from depicting Koresh of having committed multiple accounts of child abuse and statutory rape not to mention the illegal arms.  A total of 86 people were killed, only four of which were government officials. Roughly a third of those deaths were the result of a tear-gas attacks orchestrated by the FBI that turned into a fire. That fire was responsible for 76 deaths, including 25 children, two pregnant women, and David Koresh.   > \u201cThe only reason I even wrote my book was because I was so angry at the misrepresentation of who those people were \u2014 the demonization that the government and the media put in place,\u201d the survivor concluded. -Thibodeau",

    "\n\nHuman: I've heard that the Haussmann urban renewal program of Paris (1853-1927) was partly motivated by having a city layout, with wide alleys meeting at large junctions, that allows for easy crowd control using cannons and grapeshot. Is there any truth to this? Furthermore, if this statement is true, how much influence did this consideration have on the final plans and their execution? Did residents and observers at the time recognize this aspect or was it ignored in the overall controversy of tearing down Medieval neighborhoods in order to realize these plans?

            " In 1801, James Monroe and Robert R. Livingston (the R. also stood for Robert, oddly enough) were sent to Paris not to buy the enormous swath of land subsequently called the Louisiana Purchase but to negotiate the purchase of New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta, thereby securing the lucrative Mississippi River shipping route. Negotiations fell through, and it wasn't until Livingston returned in 1803 that Napoleon was so hard-up on cash due to the continent-wide war of conquest he was waging that he was willing to make a deal with the Americans. At the time, Livingston was authorized by Jefferson to spend up to $9 million in order to purchase New Orleans and the rights to the Mississippi. Since the US was planning on making a significant purchase from France, the delegation (Monroe rejoined Livingston in Paris shortly thereafter) travelled to Paris with $3 million in gold. In 1803,gold was worth just under $20 an ounce, which means they were travelling with almost 10,000 lbs of gold. This wasn't even remotely close to the carrying capacity of freighters of the time. \"Tea Clipper\" Frigates of that time could carry twenty times that weight..  Now, the negotiations took a turn when Napoleon decided he needed more money and offered the whole Louisiana Purchase for $15 million. Livingston and Monroe were authorized by Jefferson to spend up to 9 million on New Orleans and the rights to the Mississippi, so when given this offer, they had to make a decision without the President's approval, and just couldn't pass up the deal. Oddly enough, I just read the chapter describing the negotiations in Stephen Clarke's very entertaining *1000 Years of Annoying the French*.  According to Clarke, the purchase was paid for with the above-mentioned 3 million in gold as a down payment, with the cancelling of 3.75 million in debt that France owed to the US for French piracy on American ships since the revolution, and the rest was issued in bonds. Again from Clarke:  >French Banks were too nervous to accept the bonds, and two foreign banks had to step in to provide the cash. The first was Hope and Company,  a bank based in Amsterdam but set up by Scotsmen. The second was a London bank, Barings. Napoleon was in such dire straits that he agreed to sell the bonds to the banks at a 12.5% discount.   I hope this answers your question sufficiently!",

            " Good question!   >It's my understanding that these were, previously, merely just... The uniforms, and at some point the 'field' and 'ceremonial' uniforms began to diverge.   Broadly-speaking, in modern militaries, there are a few types of uniforms that soldiers wear during the time in service.   * Utility uniform or fatigues: Usually camouflaged, this is what soldiers wear in combat or when on deployment. It's also what most soldiers wear day-to-day basis while on post.  * PT uniform: Since dedicated physical training for soldiers became a more common practice in the early 20th century, armies began to issue a workout uniform.  * Service uniform: Basically military versions of the business suit and business casual wear. Worn in similar circumstances. Soldier who work in places like the Pentagon often wear service uniforms on a daily basis.  * Dress uniform: There are varying forms of this, including mess dress, which is a sort of military tuxedo and worn in similar circumstances. Some armies also have a dressier version of the service uniform. * Ceremonial uniform: These are usually only worn by full-time ceremonial units (e.g. the Fife and -Drum Corps of the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Regiment, which wears Revolutionary War-style uniforms) or by units with a ceremonial function (ex. the Guards regiments of the Household Division in the United Kingdom). These uniforms are often styled after 19th-century uniforms and they aren't worn by non-ceremonial units.   Today, the distinctions between these uniforms is very clear. In the past, the lines were a bit blurrier. Dressier uniforms and everyday uniforms looked much more similar than they do now.     Still, even during the 18th century and the first part of the 19th century, there was still some distinction between parade dress and what soldiers would actually wear on campaign or in camp. In other words, \"field\" and \"ceremonial\" uniforms have always been different, its just that the differences were once a bit smaller.   Soldiers often had multiple uniforms for multiple different occasions. Consider these Silesian soldiers from the Prussian army during the Napoleonic Wars, taken from Peter Hofschr\u00f6er's *Prussian Line Infantry 1792\u20131815.*   I'll use them to illustrate my points, but I'll try to speak as broadly as I can about uniform practices in this period.   * The man on the left is wearing the simple **camp dress** soldiers generally wore while doing chores in the barracks or in camp. In this case, he's wearing a forage cap and jacket, both common items of camp dress worn by ordinary soldiers from most European nations in this period.   * The soldier in the center is wearing the **campaign dress** soldiers would actually wear in combat and on the march. In cold weather, he'd wear a greatcoat, as shown. Underneath that would be his regular uniform, usually a wool coat, shirt, and trousers. Also note the oilskin shako cover he's wearing. Wearing a protective cover over your headgear was common practice on campaign in the early 1800s -- see this French shako cover from the Napoleonic Wars. The yellow coat facings indicate he is from a Silesian regiment.  * The soldier on the right is wearing **parade dress** \\-- generally speaking, parade dress could use elements of the campaign dress (for example, he's wearing the same shako he'd wear on campaign, just without the cover). Of course, the parade uniform also added different elements like boots, a different coat, etc. In some cases, elite units like grenadiers might also wear a bearskin or a miter cap on parade, etc. Plumes, feathers, and other ornamentation are also worn -- they'd be packed away or left behind while soldiers were on campaign.   You can see a more direct comparison between these Prussian grenadiers from 1806. The man on the left is wearing parade dress, while the man in the center has on his campaign dress. Note that the headgear and the coat are the same, but the footwear and trousers are quite different.   There's a similar trend in officers' uniforms. These officers of the Foot Guards show off some of the differences.   * The officer on the left is wearing the **undress** uniform. This is what officers would wear day-to-day around the barracks or in garrison.  * The officer in the center is wearing the **service uniform**. In the Napoleonic period, it's what officers (and men, for that matter) would actually wear while serving on campaign. As a note: nowadays, \"service dress\" uniforms are essentially the military equivalent of a business suit, so they aren't worn in combat.  **So how did we get to where we are today?**   We have soldiers fighting in Afghanistan wearing camouflaged fatigues, officer in the Pentagon wearing the military version of the suit and tie, and Grenadier Guards outside Buckingham Palace wearing bearskins and red coats.   Well, there are a few things to look at.  1. What soldiers wear in combat or while working.  2. What soldiers wear on parade and for other more formal occasions. 3. What soldiers wear while \"walking out\" from their posts or working at headquarters.   4. What ceremonial units wear.   In the early 1800s, the uniforms for all these situations were often very similar. As we've seen from the Prussian examples, soldiers often on parade and on campaign wore uniforms of a very similar style. In some cases, they wore the same thing on parade and on campaign, just with minor variations, like the addition of plumes or new trousers.  Now, here's the major change: from the late 1800s and to the mid 1900s, soldiers start wearing increasingly-different uniforms for these different occasions. WWI and WWII really accelerate this process. There isn't really one instant of change, but rather its a period of transition that takes place over several decades. **This gets to the WHEN of your question.**   The uniforms that soldiers wear in combat and while in garrison get a lot simpler for a variety of reasons. **This gets to the WHY of your question.**   * Industrial warfare and mass-mobilization meant uniforms got simpler and simpler. Armies had to cloth millions and million of men, so issuing everyone with elaborate uniforms wasn't feasible, even with more industrialized clothing production. During WWI, for example, soldiers tended to get one style of uniform. On parade, you wore your service dress uniform. In battle, you wore your service dress uniform. Even in WWII, when soldiers might get a dress uniform for parades and fatigues for combat, the uniforms were pretty simple.  * The Open Order Revolution of the mid- to late-1800s meant soldiers fought less and less in packed lines and more and more in loose formations. Individual mobility and camouflage became increasingly important, so campaigning uniforms became plainer, simpler, and less-restrictive. The bright blues, reds, and other colors disappear (except for the French, who keep their red trousers until 1915!) and they are replaced with more muted colors like khaki and *feldgrau.*   * Civilian fashions became simpler and less-elaborate. The business suit and the lounge suit become popular for men around the turn of the century. Military service uniforms adopted similar cuts, especially for officer's uniforms.    You can see the resulting evolution of battlefield uniforms for the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Army.",
            " Many countries began fighting World War 1 with colorful uniforms typical of the one's you described. [Here] (https://imgur.com/a/GckprdA) is an example of the change in French military uniforms from the beginning to the end of the war.   In a large formation with elaborate plans that required different units to move around in the Napoleonic and prior eras, observers and general officers needed the different pieces of their tactical puzzle to be easily discernable from afar. This necessity also built up the unit cultures over time, an important part of military esprit de corps which you see celebrated in the photo you linked.  In his history work, The First World War, John Keegan describes this process of change. According to him, uniforms started much like they had been at the time of the Franco-Prussian war with soft caps and often elaborate regalia (by modern standards). I imagine you don't need to have read his book to imagine what heavy shelling and trench warfare did to men in soft-caps and old bright uniforms--they were clearly not suitable for conditions in hindsight.   [Here] (https://imgur.com/gallery/b0Go8) is a large NSFW gallery of primary source documents, i.e. photos taken of some archealogical digs in Europe and some old phtos from multiple points throughout the war. Notice the uniform when the year is available. By the end, you might start to be able to make an educated guess on the year just by the uniforms and head coverings in the photo.   Tactically, while the fighting through no-mans land did involve some old time Battle Drill 1-A (everyone charge at the enemy, screaming with your bayonette out), for the most part, company and batallion sized maneuvers were replaced by squad sized maneuvers. This meant you had small groups of 4-10 maneuvering carefully through terrain to lay barbed wire, harrass a certain part of the enemy position and conduct small raids. For this type of activity, uniforms that blended in, were tidy (no giant coattails and feathers sticking up) and allowed you to move through difficult terrain were needed.   But that French image is merely a useful tool to show that if a single point in time must be chosen for your question, World War One is that time. The British, for example, had uniforms from the time of the Boer War that very much resembled their World War 1 uniforms, at least compared to the colorful French ones. That's because the Brits in South Africa were some of the first Europeans to see what facing modern weaponry and guerilla tactics required from uniforms. (Tactically, maybe they could, should have learned a bit more.)   If I'm not mistaken (searching for the section from Keegan, will update if I can find citation) even the English started the war with soft caps. The Boar War pith helmet was not steel and either way, was part of the hot-weather uniform, not their temperate weather uniform.   *John Keegan's work (ISBN 13: 978-0375700453) is excellent and the best I have read on the early part of the war.   [This] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzf9aHZmCAM&list=PL9-2UnSOnlzX6oQ7IK9e9s1N-zZ_V-Ole) documentary series is also fantastic if you're not a bookish type."

Even in WWII, when soldiers might get a dress uniform for parades and fatigues for combat, the uniforms were pretty simple.  * The Open Order Revolution of the mid- to late-1800s meant soldiers fought less and less in packed lines and more and more in loose formations. Individual mobility and camouflage became increasingly important, so campaigning uniforms became plainer, simpler, and less-restrictive. The bright blues, reds, and other colors disappear (except for the French, who keep their red trousers until 1915!) and they are replaced with more muted colors like khaki and *feldgrau.*   * Civilian fashions became simpler and less-elaborate. The business suit and the lounge suit become popular for men around the turn of the century. Military service uniforms adopted similar cuts, especially for officer's uniforms.    You can see the resulting evolution of battlefield uniforms for the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Army.",
        "rejected_target": " Many countries began fighting World War 1 with colorful uniforms typical of the one's you described. [Here] (https://imgur.com/a/GckprdA) is an example of the change in French military uniforms from the beginning to the end of the war.   In a large formation with elaborate plans that required different units to move around in the Napoleonic and prior eras, observers and general officers needed the different pieces of their tactical puzzle to be easily discernable from afar. This necessity also built up the unit cultures over time, an important part of military esprit de corps which you see celebrated in the photo you linked.  In his history work, The First World War, John Keegan describes this process of change. According to him, uniforms started much like they had been at the time of the Franco-Prussian war with soft caps and often elaborate regalia (by modern standards). I imagine you don't need to have read his book to imagine what heavy shelling and trench warfare did to men in soft-caps and old bright uniforms--they were clearly not suitable for conditions in hindsight.   [Here] (https://imgur.com/gallery/b0Go8) is a large NSFW gallery of primary source documents, i.e. photos taken of some archealogical digs in Europe and some old phtos from multiple points throughout the war. Notice the uniform when the year is available. By the end, you might start to be able to make an educated guess on the year just by the uniforms and head coverings in the photo.   Tactically, while the fighting through no-mans land did involve some old time Battle Drill 1-A (everyone charge at the enemy, screaming with your bayonette out), for the most part, company and batallion sized maneuvers were replaced by squad sized maneuvers. This meant you had small groups of 4-10 maneuvering carefully through terrain to lay barbed wire, harrass a certain part of the enemy position and conduct small raids. For this type of activity, uniforms that blended in, were tidy (no giant coattails and feathers sticking up) and allowed you to move through difficult terrain were needed.   But that French image is merely a useful tool to show that if a single point in time must be chosen for your question, World War One is that time. The British, for example, had uniforms from the time of the Boer War that very much resembled their World War 1 uniforms, at least compared to the colorful French ones. That's because the Brits in South Africa were some of the first Europeans to see what facing modern weaponry and guerilla tactics required from uniforms. (Tactically, maybe they could, should have learned a bit more.)   If I'm not mistaken (searching for the section from Keegan, will update if I can find citation) even the English started the war with soft caps. The Boar War pith helmet was not steel and either way, was part of the hot-weather uniform, not their temperate weather uniform.   *John Keegan's work (ISBN 13: 978-0375700453) is excellent and the best I have read on the early part of the war.   [This] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzf9aHZmCAM&list=PL9-2UnSOnlzX6oQ7IK9e9s1N-zZ_V-Ole) documentary series is also fantastic if you're not a bookish type."

    "\n\nHuman: What is the psychology behind the Holocaust Denial? What are the factors that explain the resilience against any historical and archeological evidence that explain the existence of the Holocaust? Why is there such resilience against this infamous genocide versus other controversies that occurred? Please, I want to highlight that I am not a denier here.  I like to look into different sides of the argument as people and I learned that how history is taught is also what it is written and interpreted.  Now the evidence that we have (from what I have gathered) of the existence of the Holocaust are plenty.  Firstly, Hitler's speeches and his Mein Kampf book show many hints of the hatred and scapegoating of Jews.  Next are the anti-Jewish acts that occurred in Germany before they are hunted and killed such as businesses that were owned by Jews were closed and declared illegal, homes and shops of Jewish people were vandalised, synapogues were closed, and Jewish people had to wear tags or labels or the Star of David as a clear indicator.  Then, there are the documents and the places that show the existence of the Holocaust. Auschwitz is the most obvious example and a powerful one. The conditions of the place show how the Jews were treated and the uniform that they wore, and the amount of shoes collected of the ones that were killed and gassed, numbers and tattoes in every one and so on.  The Nuremberg trials are also evidence of the existence of war criminals who used the war effort or had some influence in the Nazi party on the acts that were conducted against Jews and other people that were deemed inferior or the enemy of the Germans.  The sheer number, scale and intensity of it feels unbelievably unreal (I must admit, even I find it hard to swallow that people were and are go to such extreme lengths) but many evidence show that this genocide existed.  Now, I want to show a different side here.  When I hear a revisionists' argument or an argument of an Denialist who wants to question the evidence that was gathered, I also want to look into that argument as well.  Is the evidence actually valid and real? Do the Denialists' evidence and arguments also hold as much validity and merit? Can the science of psychology show that the human species is indeed capable of such extreme acts?  At the same time, I am also puzzled and curious as to why there is this level of confirmation bias about this topic, particularly towards the Holocaust.  What are the factors or the reasonings that explain why some people are inclined to deny the collected evidence or question the actuality of this era?  As there a common theme involved such as paranoia or a certain upbringing or anti-governmental attitudes or imperialistic values?  Why is there such focus on wanting to deny the actions that occurred that were made by those who took part of the Holocaust than for example in other genocides or controversial topics that existed, especially in recent memory such as the Armenian genocide or when Japanese-American citizens were put into concentration camps of their own by America when the latter entered the war?  (please correct me if I am wrong whether the concentration camps of the Japanese-Americans were of the same level of poor quality and poor conditions as those of Nazi Germany)\n\nAssistant:": {

            " My Monday methods on Holocaust denial has already been posted but I also want to repost something I have written some time ag about holocaust denial, its history, prevalence and motive.  **Part 1**  The short version is that people adjust what they choos to believe in accordance with their political prejudices and opinions most of the time and people who advocate Holocaust denial are, in large parts, anti-Semites of some flavor or another.  ## What is the Holocaust? What is Holocaust Denial?  As a starting point, I'm going to define what is the Holocaust and subsequently, what is Holocaust Denial.  Within the relevant scholarly literature, the term Holocaust is defined as the systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of approximately six million Jews and up to half a million Roma, Sinti, and other groups persecuted as \"gypsies\" by the Nazi regime and its collaborators. It took place at the same time as other atrocities and crimes such as the Nazis targeting other groups on grounds of their perceived \"inferiority\", like the disabled and Slavs, and on grounds of their religion, ideology or behavior among them Communists, Socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses and homosexuals. During their 12-year reign, the conservative estimate of victims of Nazi oppression and murder numbers 11 million people, though newer studies put that number at somewhere between 15 and 20 million people.  Holocaust Denial is the attempt and effort to negate, distort, and/or minimize and trivialize the established facts about the Nazi genocides against Jews, Roma, and others most often with the goal to rehabilitate Nazism as an ideology.  Because of the staggering numbers given above, the fact that the Nazi regime applied the tools at the disposal of the modern state to genocidal ends, their sheer brutality, and a variety of other factors, the ideology of Nazism and the broader historical phenomenon of Fascism in which Nazism is often placed, have become \u2013 rightfully so \u2013 politically tainted. As and ideology that is at its core racist, anti-Semitic, and genocidal, Nazism and Fascism have become politically discredited throughout most of the world.  Holocaust Deniers primarily seek to remove this taint from the ideology of Nazism by distorting, ignoring, and misrepresenting historical fact and thereby make Nazism and Fascism socially acceptable again. In other words, Holocaust Denial is a form of political agitation in the service of bigotry, racism, and anti-Semitism.  In his book *Lying about Hitler* Richard Evans summarizes the following points as the most frequently held beliefs of Holocaust Deniers:  > (a) The number of Jews killed by the Nazis was far less than 6 million; it amounted to only a few hundred thousand, and was thus similar to, or less than, the number of German civilians killed in Allied bombing raids. > > (b) Gas chambers were not used to kill large numbers of Jews at any time. > > (c) Neither Hitler nor the Nazi leaderhsip in general had a program of exterminating Europe's Jews; all they wished to do was to deport them to Eastern Europe. > > (d) \"The Holocaust\" was a myth invented by Allied propaganda during the war and sustained since then by Jews who wished to use it for political and financial support for the state of Israel or for themselves. The supposed evidence for the Nazis' wartime mass murder of millions of Jews by gassing and other means was fabricated after the war.  Richard Evans: *Lying about Hitler. History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial*, New York 2001, p. 110]  ## A short history of Holocaust Denial and its methods in the West  Holocaust denialism has its roots in the Nazis' own efforts to hide their crimes from the world. I have gone into this before [here. Especially the efforts of Sonderkommando 1005 and the destruction of records at the end of the war was intended to hide and deny these crimes and thus portray the regime in a more positive light.  This was , of course, used in Nuremberg and other various post war trials by the defendants, who either pushed a narrative of not having known, not having been involved, or all going back to Hitler, Himmler, Heydrich and others who were dead or otherwise not present at Nuremberg (Eichmann e.g., who was made out by Dieter Wisliceny to be sort of a master mind of the Holocaust). Similarly, several defendants at Nuremberg engage in what has developed to become a classical tactics of deniers, e.g. minimizing the numbers, taking code language out of context with phrases such as resettlement, chalking up deaths to disease etc.  Also, surrounding Nuremberg and the revelations of the Nazi crimes, several different strands of fascist, right-wing extremist, and Nazi political agendas started to deny the Holocaust for a variety for reasons. In Germany, you -- of course -- have all the former Nazis who in order present a clean image of the regime and to rehabilitate themselves and the Nazi regime started to write books where they claimed the Holocaust to have either not happened or be the result of a Jewish conspiracy. For example, Otto von dem Bach-Zelewski, former head of an Einsatzgruppe, who had freely given information at the Nuremberg trials and thus saved his skin started in the 1950s to once again reverse his stand and put out a wealth of denialist literature. Similarly, a plethora of former Wehrmacht generals and officers engaged in their own form of denial by either denying the crimes of the regime outright or by presenting the Wehrmacht as not involved in such crimes. Especially the latter, the myth of the clean Wehrmacht, was one of the most successful forms of Holocaust denial and was very popular in Germany until the 80s and can still be observed today.  Another political agenda that used Holocaust denialism as its tool right after the war, was a certain strand of proto-fascist and right-wing extremist thinkers who wanted to clean fascism and their ideology from the strain of being associated with Hitler and the Holocaust. Douglas Reed is such an example. Reed, who was a prominent journalist in Great Britain, was against Hitler but not against Nationalsocialism (he favored the Otto Strasser position). In the late 40s, early 50s he started publishing books which claimed Hitler had been a Zionist agent and his policy of killing the Jews was a Jewish plot to justify the creation of Israel and which was done against the wishes of many Nazis. At some point it became increasingly hard for him to find publishers, so he moved to South Africa and became involved in supporting apartheid politics in SA and Rhodesia.  Another -- and rather odd -- strand of denialism comes from a pacifists. Pacifism had been very popular during the time between the World Wars because of the effects of WWI and after World War Two, a couple of people of the radical pacifist movement saw their positions threatened because the crimes of the Nazis were a major reason why the war against Nazi Germany was portrayed as a moral and necessary war. In the United States, a former mainstream historian and pacifist activist, Harry Elmer Barnes, started publishing literature that claimed the Holocaust was an Allied invention to justify their war against German, which they had started in 1939.  Another example of this is the -- still cited by Holocaust deniers to this day -- work of Paul Rassinier, who in many a ways is the father of modern Holocaust denial. Rassinier, also a staunch pacifist, was a member of the French resistance, where he -- unsuccessfully -- tried to get the Resistance to engage the Nazi occupation peacefully rather than with violence. Arrested by the Nazis in 1943 and deported to the Buchenwald and later Dora-Mittelbau Concentration Camps, Rassinier did write several books and pamphlets after the war in which he denied the existence of gas chambers and of mass extermination - ostensibly because he had never experienced it.  Rassinier was an odd fellow, whose work could be engaged in its own journal article. He, for example, did not deny the brutality of the camps but instead of holding the SS responsible, he blamed his fellow prisoners. Something, which could and has been engaged in modern scholarship as the result of the perfidious Nazi camp system.  But aside from the reason of Rassinier denying the Holocaust because he never experienced it, he also started to engage in Holocaust denial because he was an anti-Semite and a lot of his writing is informed by his hatred for Jews and the state of Israel, which he saw as based on a Jewish lie and as a threat to peace. The fact that Rassinier was a survivor, an academically trained historian, and a Holocaust denying anti-Semite makes his works favorites in denialist circles to this day.  Holocaust denialism the way we know it today started in the 1960s/70s with the rise of neo-fascist and neo-extreme rightits political movements and causes. Not directly referencing Nazism and old-school fascism as their sources of inspiration but still viewing themselves in the same historical lineage, a lot of these people saw themselves as the right counter-movement to the New Left of 1968 and so on. From Arthur Butz to David Irving, it was this generation who had not themselves taken part in the war and in the Anglosphere rejected the narratives of their elders as the Second World War being just, which formed the most tropes, arguments and methods used by Holocaust deniers to this day. This ranges from the supposedly \"scientific\" denialism of Leuchter and Z\u00fcndel to the more subtle relativism of Irving and Nolte to the outright denial of everything like Faurisson's.",

            " Eighteenth-century British North America isn't one of the three places you identified, but I suspect this will be interesting to you and others.  To understand wealth in eighteenth-century America, historians often use tax lists. Their study of them hasn't been comprehensive, but has in many cases focused on large port cities (which aren't necessarily representative of the rest of the continent). These tax lists are a bit quirky. They weren't produced every year, or even every decade. Only a few have survived. They don't necessarily account for all of an individual's wealth, because some folks were very good at hiding wealth from tax assessors. Moreover, they tend to only count heads of household or individuals with property (usually white men, sometimes widows, never enslaved people).   With those limitations in mind, what historians have found is that if you divide these tax lists into brackets, those at the top did own an extremely high proportion of the wealth, particularly in the late eighteenth century. I haven't found any analysis that breaks this down into the \"top 1%,\" unfortunately, but here is how historian Gary Nash breaks down several tax lists from colonial British North America:  1693 Philadelphia tax list:  * 0-30% bracket: 2.2% of wealth  * 31-60% bracket: 15.2% of wealth  * 61-90% bracket: 36.6% of wealth  * 91-100% bracket: 46.0% of wealth (13.2% in 91-95% bracket, 32.8% in 96-100% bracket)  1730 New York City tax list:  * 0-30% bracket: 6.2% of wealth  * 31-60% bracket: 13.9% of wealth  * 61-90% bracket: 36.5% of wealth  * 91-100% bracket: 43.7% of wealth (14.2% in 91-95% bracket, 25.4% in 96-100% bracket)  1767 Philadelphia tax list:   * 0-30% bracket: 1.8% of wealth  * 31-60% bracket: 5.5% of wealth  * 61-90% bracket: 27.0% of wealth  * 91-100% bracket: 65.7% of wealth (16.2% in 91-95% bracket, 49.5% in 96-100% bracket)  1771 Boston tax list:  * 0-30% bracket: 0.1% of wealth  * 31-60% bracket: 9.1% of wealth  * 61-90% bracket: 27.4% of wealth  * 91-100% bracket: 63.4% of wealth (14.7% in 91-95% bracket, 48.7% in 96-100% bracket)  1774 Philadelphia tax list:   * 0-30% bracket: 1.1% of wealth  * 31-60% bracket: 4% of wealth  * 61-90% bracket: 22.6% of wealth  * 91-100% bracket: 72.3% of wealth (16.8% in 91-95% bracket, 55.5% in 96-100% bracket)  While there are definitely limits to what this tells us, as I noted above, these numbers are a pretty powerful indication that there was, at least, a high concentration of wealth at the top end of urban society in eighteenth-century British North America\u2014and that this concentration probably rose over the course of the eighteenth century. If you look at the top 10% bracket in Philadelphia, this rung of society went from owning 46% of wealth in 1693 to owning 72.3% in 1774. Compare that top 10% bracket to today, where (in 2013) the top 10% of families owned 76% of wealth. That's not so far off.  The 1774 Philadelphia tax list is particularly interesting to me, because it came just two years before the Declaration of Independence was signed in the same city. The enormous wealth stratification at the time, and the fact that many of the delegates who signed onto the notion that \"All men are created equal\" likely belonged to the top 10% of society, really sets that document into a different context.    So what does this tell us? For me, it's an indication that industrialization cannot be regarded as the sole cause of wealth concentration.

If you look at the top 10% bracket in Philadelphia, this rung of society went from owning 46% of wealth in 1693 to owning 72.3% in 1774. Compare that top 10% bracket to today, where (in 2013) the top 10% of families owned 76% of wealth. That's not so far off.  The 1774 Philadelphia tax list is particularly interesting to me, because it came just two years before the Declaration of Independence was signed in the same city. The enormous wealth stratification at the time, and the fact that many of the delegates who signed onto the notion that \"All men are created equal\" likely belonged to the top 10% of society, really sets that document into a different context.    So what does this tell us? For me, it's an indication that industrialization cannot be regarded as the sole cause of wealth concentration.

            " Consider both the audience, and the materials available.   Most premodern cookbooks were written by professional cooks, for professional cooks. So they often didn\u2019t feel the need to walk their peers through every step- as there were many things that they would expect any other cook to already know. Each cook learned their art through working with more established chefs- and in theory should not need to be told how to judge if a food is ready to eat, or the exact right amount of seasonings. Contrast this with today\u2019s recipes, which are most commonly professional or amateur cooks writing for amateur cooks, and so they assume only basic knowledge.  Although when the pros write for other pros today, they can be extremely specific, due to what I\u2019ll talk about next.  Second, both the cooking supplies and the foods could be very inconsistent. If you\u2019ve ever seen a painting of raw foods from bygone eras- they often looked very different. (Such as Giovanni Stanchi\u2019s 17th century watermelons, which barely look edible compared to today\u2019s bright pink seedless melons). Modern food production is very standardized and relatively consistent, so we can have precise recipes that work out, because generally cooks know how big certain products will be and what flavors and the potency they will have. But if one cook is writing for another cook in another place, working with potentially very different products, telling them to use three carrots in a dish can be somewhat unpredictable- maybe they are bigger or smaller or of a different tasting variety that has long since stopped being widely available- so the idea is that if the recipe has carrots, the cook should use his good judgment to determine the appropriate amount for however many servings he will make.   Third, modern cooks, both amateur and professional, have the advantage of consistent heating elements. The gas stove was a 19th century invention, so anyone before that was largely limited to putting their pots and pans over fires/hot coals, or into an oven- and for all of those it was difficult to maintain a consistent temperature. So there\u2019d be no sense in writing \u201cfry the onions for three minutes\u201d or to \u201cbake the cake for 35 minutes\u201d. Any cook worth his salt should know  what fried onions or a baked cake should look like- so a lot of recipes sound more like \u201ccook until done\u201d without explicitly saying what that means.  Anyway, much like Medieval cookbooks I\u2019ve been a bit vague so far, so here\u2019s a more concrete example of how this works. This is a recipe for \u201cGallina Dorada\u201d (Gilded Hen) from Nuevo Arte de Cocina (1746) by Juan Altamiras, a Spanish friar and cook. (obviously this is from after the medieval period, but it is a recipe that was old then, and I think still reflects the cookbook writing mindset leading to OP's question).  \u201cTake a well-fattened hen, cut off its feet, wing tips and neck, clean it well and boil it in your stewpot for meat. When it is tender, fasten it on the spit. Now wrap a little lump of cured ham fat in paper, spear it on the point of the spit, set fire to the paper and hold the spit upright so the melted fat drips down all over the hen. Crack open four eggs, beat their yolks, paint them on your hot hen and, as it roasts, add sugar and cinnamon, or just cinnamon. You may serve the broth first as a soup spiced with cinnamon and take it to table before your gilded hen. This is a good dish for capons or other birds too.\u201d  The recipe doesn\u2019t tell you how big a hen you need, how long exactly to boil or to roast it, how much lard, sugar or cinnamon to use. But yet, it still largely makes sense. The amounts of those other ingredients depends on how big a hen you have (or if you use another bird entirely), or how much you like the taste of cinnamon sugar on chicken (spoiler alert, my SO did not like it at all when I made this). Similarly, there\u2019s no time given, but\u2026 it\u2019s a chicken. Boil it until it is cooked, then take it out- with the inference to be made that you don\u2019t need to roast it for very long, just long enough for the egg, lard, cinnamon sugar glaze to set. Depending on your fire, that time could vary, but hey, you can serve some nice chicken broth to your guests while you work on that.",

            " How many online recipes have you glanced over, knowing that you'll probably never make them? How many times have you sighed and swiped or scrolled down, down, down, *down* past the story of the blogger's great-aunt's best friend's sun-dappled terra-cotta kitchen floor? Cookbooks, as scholars have long recognized, are a literary genre of their own.  That doesn't mean that medieval cookbooks were exclusively in the \"read for fun\" category. In medieval/early modern German lit, we'd call them a subset of *Sachliteratur*--mostly instruction books/books about practical subjects. But what kind of practical use, and how, definitely differed. And medieval reader-users were not just looking for directions from their cookbooks.  One important use of cookbooks was actually medicinal. Medieval medicine was based around the idea of keeping a balance of the four humors in the body, a balance that needed to be maintained and fixed including through the ingredients and preparation of food. So cookbooks as diverse as Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq's from 10C Baghdad and Anna Weckerin's in 16C Colmar (which enjoyed massive popularity in print) stress very heavily the possibilities of some of their recipes to help cure the sick. (And also, in Weckerin's case, \"Here is the section] about fish, but these don't help sick people and are of little use.\")  Another use, particularly in medieval Christian Europe, was to show cooks ways to change up meat dishes for Lent, like the 14C Italian cookbook that suggests substituting ground-up almonds for the meat in a lasagna recipe.  With purposes like those, exact amounts are sort of beside the point--it's a different type of instruction being sought and offered. In general, though, the lack of precise quantities and time frames reflects modern cooking practices, just not modern cook *books*. Look at any 5-star recipe on allrecipes.com, and the comments/reviews will say \"This is the GREATEST RECIPE! All I had to do was halve the amount of flour, add 10 minutes more of steeping the duck breast in the mixture of spices, oh and I added saffron and honey to that mixture, and...seriously, THE BEST food I have ever had.\"  And people were generally not working from nothing--these cookbooks aren't a matter of someone getting into a new cuisine entirely. Massimo Montanari remarks that many medieval cookbooks were aimed at *experts*; not necessarily *professionals*, but people who do know the basic methods and ingredients available to them. The cookbook did not exist in a vacuum. It united with the cook's personal experiences and in-person instruction/experimentation to create what we would consider a \"full\" recipe.  And then, of course, there were the fancy, even illuminated cookbooks that served exactly the function of our blogs and bookmarks today: a marker of aspiration and social status. I am [want to be] the sophisticated, open-minded person capable of cooking and enjoying all these foods. No mind that the only way I will ever actually eat them is if I pay someone else to make it. [whether a servant or a restaurant chef].  ~~  Sources/Further Reading:  * Massimo Montanari, *Medieval Tastes: Food, Cooking, and the Table* (2012) * Albrecht Classen, \"Sixteenth-Century Cookbooks, *Artes* Literature, and the Female Voice,\" in *The Power of a Woman's Voice in Medieval and Early Modern Europe* (2007)  OR  * For some medieval food history in general, you can preorder my own book, [How to Slay a Dragon: A Fantasy Hero's Guide to the Real Middle Ages, a handbook for surviving your next fantasy novel or D&D campaign using advice from actual medieval history--in this case, you can learn what (not) to eat at the inn and how to throw a feast that will impress a king.

It's possible they might have records or oral histories in their archives    Last but not least, once you have it protected, you could contact the historical archaeology department at your state university. This would be a great PhD project, and could yield valuable information about the lives of these people. You will probably not find their names, but they would have a voice. That is my opinion, and you have to do what you think is the right thing.",

    "\n\nHuman: [MN] How do I go about talking to my coworker about their foul breath? I have spoken to my supervisor twice now about how it\u2019s extremely unpleasant to work with a coworker due to the smell of their breath. Each time the next day or so said coworker will have gum/breath mints and then it stops after that. I can see visible plaque build up on their teeth that suggests they don\u2019t brush daily(or ever, idk really). Should I talk to HR and have them have another conversation or should I just be direct with my coworker and tell them they need to have better oral hygiene? I eat lunch with them every day and we work on the same small team so we\u2019re in close proximity often. The company itself though is 1000+ people so we have a whole HR team. I don\u2019t want to create an awkward work environment but the smell is so bad it creates an uncomfortable working environment for me.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: I (24M) am being harassed at work (80M) and am not sure how to handle it professionally. I work at a nonprofit organization in Texas doing fundraising and donor relationship management among other things. We don't really have a HR department. I'm new to the field, and it's kind of a dream job (or at least a step on the way to a better dream job), so I am not sure how to deal with some things and have probably made a few missteps that have led me to where I am. Regardless, I'd like some advice on how to deal with this without quitting or burning bridges.  I started at a musuem last year and was introduced to a man in his 80s who donates a fair amount of folk art to the museum. Nothing ground-breaking, but he's been doing this for quite a while and has developed a relationship with the org and a friendship with our founding director. When I started, I just thought he was a friendly but crass old man who was maybe a little touchy or that there was a generational gap in understandings of professionalism/appropriateness. I would receive the occasional \"Forwards from Grandpa\" type email with a dirty joke every once in a while, but the relationship quickly crossed a physical line, ie grabbing my hand and holding me uncomfortably close during a handshake, too much touching on my back, comments on my figure or how my clothes fit (I like to keep in shape and am typically well-dressed at work), to a strange amount of him giving me things like old clothes, folk art, or magazines, which I would usually just accept graciously but throw away or donate to Goodwill once he left. I was uncomfortable about it but I also know I can be a very reserved and private person and wanted to be optimistic about it, as it is my job to keep donors happy.   Around Christmas, he invited me to stay at his apartment while he was away, and I tried to politely decline, and he asked if my email was monitored, which I ignored. At a opening reception, he got drunk and openly admitted to me that he knows exactly what he's doing in harassing me, knows that I hate and am made uncomfortable by his comments and actions, and mentioned that he loves to flirt with me simply because he can. this really upset me because my suspicions that he uses his status and \"nice old man\" persona to be a predator. When I had enough and mentioned this to some of the senior employees they basically said \"it's ____, what do you expect? I'm just glad he's not focusing on me any longer\" and discouraged me from bringing it up to our director. I'm not sure if the director is aware of it but I'm also not sure how they wouldn't be at this point. There have been other creepy things he's done since but you get the picture.   What should I do? I've tried keeping a professional arm's length since, or introducing him to my girlfriend but it's just getting worse. I don't want to damage the relationship the org has with him because it's my job to preserve these kinds of giving relationships but I'm kind of at my wit's end with the creepiness and intentional harassment. I figured initially I'd just put up with it until Father Time took care of business but I'd rather stand up for myself at this point.  TL;DR: friendly old donor at non-profit turns out to be creepy and i am not sure how to handle it professionally Location: Texas, USA.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " You're kind of a rock and a hard place, but I think you should definitely discuss it with your Director.  You're in a role not a whole lot different from a salesperson, or even a Hooters waitress.  Part of your job, and the way to be successful at your job, is to being friendly with people.  And in some cases - perhaps too many - that's going to mean being friendly with people who you wouldn't otherwise be friendly with, and possibly even with people who outright repulse you.  You can only decide for yourself how far you're willing to go with that.  Certainly personal security would be a reasonable boundary (and a good reason to turn down the offer to stay at his apartment), but it doesn't sound like this 80 year old dude is actually a physical threat to you.  So I think you need to bring your Director up to speed and get direction / approval from them on how you approach it.  From what I can see, there's only 4 reasonable possibilities:  1. Too bad.  Suck it up.  It's part of the job and you better not screw up the relationship with this donor because we count on him too much to lose his money because you can't flirt with him a little bit (you can interpret this response as your employer basically asking you to be a low-key prostitute).  2. We're going to fix this by having someone else handle this donor.  You shouldn't have any significant interaction with him going forward.  (Solves *your* problem, but probably doesn't solve *the* problem).  3. Wow.  That's not really acceptable, but he's an important funder to our organization.  Do your best to preserve the relationship while also enforcing your own personal boundaries.  If that causes him to stop funding us, then so be it.  We'll support you and we've got your back.  (Pretty much solves the problem, but puts it on you to balance the needs of the organization and your personal needs).  4. WTF?  Are you serious.  Let me call him and tell him that we're no longer interested in having him affiliated with our organization in any manner whatsoever.  There's other donors out there, and we'll go find them.  (Seems to solve the problem).  Options 2, 3 and 4 are probably options you can live with even if 2 and 3 aren't ideal.  What you really need to be prepared for is what your response will be if your Director suggests Option #1.",

    "\n\nHuman: [NY] Co-worker is barging into my office and yelling at me for no reason. Does me having a heart condition factor into helping to make this stop? An employee barged into my office, swinging open the door very fast, and instantly started yelling at me, repeating herself over and over. It was because she thought I had given her the wrong file, but I pointed out it was right.  My workplace is normally very quiet. I felt pain in my heart (my real heart... not metaphorically) from the shock of her barging in and yelling hysterically to be honest. I suspected I was having heart problems before this, but I had not yet been able to see the doctor. I have since been diagnosed with a heart problem and I've been feeling ill.  After the incident, my boss happened to walk in. I was still standing in shock and breathing a little hard. I tried to tell my boss what happened, but she interrupted me before I finished my first sentence and said, \"You can't change someone's personality.\"  I have never complained about an employee, but this employee has had a pattern of yelling at me over the phone over nothing, having a really crazy critical tone in emails, and bossing me around, even though she has no authority over anyone.  The things she is getting mad about almost never have anything to do with me, and she is misunderstanding how to use something.  I've worked there for 14 years, and she's been there 2. I later learned she was treating our assistant director the same, and my boss was also dismissing her concerns with the personality comment, or telling us how great she is at a particular task she does. It feels a bit like gas-lighting. We both feel our boss doesn't want to deal with it. I informed my boss of all the previous incidents.  Heart-wise, I don't know if I can handle someone surprising me like she did and yelling at me. I'm worried if I disclose this they might say I'm not fit to work. I only miss a few days a year due to sick time. I have positive annual reviews of my work with no concerns. Should I print out my medical records to prove I have this heart problem?\n\nAssistant:": {

Slightly less nuclear option: Ask your doctor to complete the ADA paperwork asking for a reasonable accommodation shielding you from loud, disruptive behavior.   \\[No, I don't think printing out your medical records will have any impact and will likely make it should like you are a hypochondriac or are exaggerating--which you kind of do since you are claiming a connection and potential bad effects from being startled without your doctor having told you that's in fact a possibility. You need a medical expert involved. Otherwise it looks like you are trying to use your condition to get your way about a personnel matter. It would be similar to me saying that perfumes cause me to go into anaphylaxis when they actually just give me a bad headache.

Tbh, maybe you should. I mean, even if you get Susie shut down what's to say you won't experience other events that cause the same reaction.

    "\n\nHuman: [GA] How do I tell my manager about inappropriate language at the workplace? Howdy!   So, I work for the state government in Georgia. Most of my coworkers are wonderful people with whom I genuinely enjoy working; however, I have a coworker who continuously uses racial and homophobic slurs, while also asking me personal questions about my political views.   Some examples: he is the head of the RNC for our county, and, very recently used the f-slur repeatedly when discussing the behavior of his fellow GA GOP. He has also called a black client an \"Aunt Jemima\" while discussing her with Law Enforcement officers. He has also asked me my opinion of Critical Race Theory, and seemed very agitated when I asked him to change the subject.   There have been other ignorant comments; however, I usually ignore them, or simply regard them as intense personal and social differences.   The f-slur incident happened two days ago, and, being a member of the LGBT+ Community, I found myself feeling *extremely* uncomfortable. So, I've decided to bring some of these incidents up to my manager.   Here is why I'm hesitant:   - My manager was present for the \"Aunt Jemima\" comment, and said nothing.  - My direct supervisor was present for the f-slur incident, and said nothing.  - My coworker is of higher status than me. - I am the youngest employee in my department.  - I have the least experience in my department.  - I am one of two women in the seven person team. - There is not a single POC in my department.  - The GA state government itself is very heavily skewed towards one side in regards to modern social issues.    Other than this ONE coworker, I genuinely enjoy my job and my coworkers, so I am very nervous to \"stir the pot\" and jeopardize my position both occupationally, and socially.   How do I express my concerns without harming my career?   Thank you for any advice or thoughts.   **tl;dr:** My coworker uses slurs, and idk how to bring it up to my manager.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: (MN) \"Fragrance sensitive\" co-worker is dictating who does and doesn't have to change their hygiene products A woman who has worked here for years suddenly determined she had a fragrance sensitivity and we were told our department was now a fragrance free zone and we had to switch to non-scented hygiene products, laundry detergents and stop using any perfumes, whatever.  Most of us didn't listen, at which there was another warning, which I still didn't listen, at which point I was told privately by my manager there were still complaints about my fragrance and fragrance sensitivity was a \"federal disability\" (it isn't, I have access to Google) and it would become an HR issue if I didn't comply.  So at great inconvenience to me I now use non-scented crap and my wife washes my work clothes with non-scented detergent.  My issue, some women have continued to wear fragrances. The affected co-worker has deemed it ok because their specific scents don't bother her. It's now gotten to the point where they're bringing in bottles of stuff for her to sample with a little baby sniff.  Am I wrong to be offended that this woman is now the sole arbiter of what scents are allowed or not? If we have to be fragrance free, fine, but all should be banned then. People bringing in scents for this woman to approve/disapprove is just baffling to me.   Also, my research shows this is a real thing and apparently some scents give people crippling migraines, but I'm just extremely suspicious of the whole thing unless she has been tested by an allergist. For example, I was told any further violations would become an HR issue but there have been times my work attire has been accidentally washed with Gain after this started and... nothing. No complaints, no trips to HR.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Internal Hire was told job paid 100K, offered 30 less. Throw away account...  I have a bachelors degree in IT, one in Advertising and Graphic Design, and a masters in UX Development. I have 10+ years of experience. I was hired 2 years ago for a position I was over qualified for, editing simple HTML files in the marketing dept, I took it because I was burnt out/depressed and i needed a reason to get out of bed. Ive been promoted multiple times in the dept already.   Recently I applied for a position in the UX team and ended up getting an offer. The position was supposed to pay 100K. I currently make 60K. The offer they came with was 70K. Which puts me well under paid, and I would most def be the least paid person on an all-male team. (I'm a women, I know we get underpaid and under appreciated in the tech world). I tried negotiating and all I got was a hard \"No\".   They are calling it a promotion and they, under their own policies, can only give me a certain % increase. Even though it was told to me during my first interview that the salary was 100K, and this was already in the budget. The skills and knowledge needed for this position in no way match what I do now. Completely different dept, leadership, everything. HR even said they would pay me the 100K if I was an external candidate.   The company got bought out by a major, big name company and are in the process of a merger/synchronization of salaries and positions. I asked the HR rep im working with if the salary offered to me fits within the scope/grade that this position falls into. She said she didnt know...i still dont have an answer.   I know internal hires get hit with this issue, we have no leverage in negotiation...and I know I can not accept and stay in my mindless job or go to another company and make more money.   My main issue is, I was given a number...and they changed the number after I had already been offered the position. Is this ethical? I tried to be as concise and simple as i could in writing this, so im sorry for the huge wall of text. A lot of back and forth has gone on in the last week and I would like it all noted in my HR record that this happened. How would I go about doing that? Just writing a grievance letter and requesting it be put in my record? 100K to 70K is a huge difference.   Would appreciate any help...kind of lost on what to do.\n\nAssistant:": {

He was soon terminated but since then things at work having gotten hostile.

She also diminished my job title by giving my coworker a raise that matched my pay rate without giving me one even though we have completely different job responsibilities. I had a meeting with the business manager who is her boss about the issues I was having. They said they would address them but since then he has refused me any meetings. What is extremely frustrating is that I work for a union and our employee manual states that we should have a right to a complaint process with the business manager. I recently went on medical leave and she is now trying to claim that there will be a disciplinary meeting when I return because she is claiming I was rude during a prior meeting and questioned her methods. I was never made aware of any such meeting prior to me going on leave. I once again requested representation other than herself but I am not getting any response from the Business Manager. I pay union dues, but an also an at will employee.

    "\n\nHuman: [NY] General - Do you (lowkey) consider marital status when making hiring decision?    **Yes I know that's a protected class.**  **Yes I know that's a protected class.**  **Yes I know that's a protected class.**  But I have a feeling that HR may make hiring decision based on whether somebody (especially women) are married and whether they have the potential to be on maternity leave within the next 1 - 2 years. Obviously, HR is not going to say directly that \"We don't want you because you may have kids soon\", but may just tell them that there are better applicants. I know they are a protected class but my gut feeling tells me that women with the potential to be on maternity leave soon somewhat have a disadvantage, and will be told there are more qualitied applicants.

While I totally get me 40 days in couldn\u2019t run it entirely yet my concern is that they bring in a new manager, then eliminate my position as superfluous as everyone loved the old temp person. My manager sat me down later and said \u201c I wanted to reiterate she is not here to replace you\u201d however obviously leaving she can\u2019t speak for the decisions down the line. I don\u2019t know, it sounds like the new/old person will be a much better teacher but I just can\u2019t help but feel my position may be threatened. 3 HR people for barely over 100 employees seems a bit much\n\nAssistant:": {

Your only move is to do good work, ask for the training you've yet to receive, and demonstrate you are a good employee. Yes, update your resume, but also network-- the new permanent staff is obviously a favorite, figure out why. Learn what makes her valuable and mimic it, make friends, get references for future gigs.

I would also study up and try and learn anything you can on your own to show your value and help improve your performance.  EDIT: Missed the part about the temp now being permanent.",

    "\n\nHuman: [SC] How does unlimited PTO affect people's use of time off?  My workplace recently switched to unlimited PTO (Flex Time Off). I don't know how I really feel about it. It's already June and I've only taken one or two days off. I'm on my second year, so under the old system I would have ten days PTO. Now there is no number of remaining PTO days staring me in the face when I log on to the HR system. I could see myself basically forgetting to take more than a couple days off for the rest of the year.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " I recently switched to unlimited PTO as a 'perk'. We typically accrued \\~6 hours every pay or 20 days per year / 4 weeks vacation. Typically, I'd like these accrue up to the max of 160 hours, then force myself to take a day or two here and there to keep it under. I ended up using about 20 days per year then.  With the unlimited system through 6 months of this year, I've taken like 3 days max. I'm not reminded to take it and it feels guilty because other people on the account I'm taking don't have unlimited PTO.  Recently, I've been forcing myself to put days off on my calendar despite being in a situation that I'm the only person who can run some of these processes in the role I'm in. My boss (who isn't directly on the account that I'm on) just said the finance lead there will need to figure it out and just put your days off in well ahead of time.  Moral of the story: Aim for about 30 and you'll likely hit about 20. Up to about 30 days off seems reasonable given \"unlimited\", but check to see what others are doing in your company. There's a balance between doing the norm there, but also using the norm for being 'unlimited'. A good rule of thumb is to AT LEAST take off what you were given yearly before. If that's 20 days, take 20 days. Pretend it's accruing.",

I was assigned to review and spread tax returns and other financials for a new loan request. The problem is the guarantor lives part time in the US but works in and is a citizen of Sweden so they sent us Swedish tax returns. I can't read Swedish. I bring the problem up to my superior who says to just use Google translate. I replied saying that I cannot in good conscious do a $10 million deal using Google translate and that we would need professional translation services rendered or that the deal be reassigned to someone here that is fluent in Swedish. I was told to do it and refused again.  Later that day, I get pulled in by HR and my superior and am written up for insubordination. Next day, my superior says to work on the Swedish documents. I refuse again giving the same explanation. Same thing happens again being written up for insubordination. Following day it happens again and I'm told I'm being terminated with cause due to the documented insubordination.  Is the \"for cause\" legitimate?

Company X was founded by our CEO ***\"Jim\"*** over 50 years ago, and he still works for the company today. Jim is very controlling, so he won't retire, even though he is over 80 years old.   Since I started his health has been declining. ***Jim*** has had a couple falls, and since has been diagnosed with Myasenthia Gravis and mainly has trouble with holding his neck up, so we don't think that it's a major factor in the main issue.   &#x200B;  Like I stated in the title, ***Jim*** has pooped on the floor of the bathroom (accidentally) and just left for the day to go clean himself multiple times. We have about 60 people who work in our office, and there is only one stall for women and one for men. This basically renders the bathroom useless for the day, as no one wants to clean up human feces off the floor. We also notice that he smells like human feces and we are starting to get nervous that we will get sick or contract illness due to his extreme lack of hygiene.   &#x200B;  He is showing no signs of retiring, even though he has a net worth of over a billion dollars. We don't have a real \"HR Department\" and a bunch of us (including people who have worked here for 25+ years) Don't know what to do/ what options to take.   &#x200B;  What can we do?\n\nAssistant:": {

The larger FFCRA includes two pieces of leave-related   legislation, the Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act and the   Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act, and requires employers to provide two kinds of paid leave related to   COVID-19. Keep in mind a leave is paid to employees who cannot perform   their job duties and who are not working.

Has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine 3. Is experiencing symptoms and is seeking medical diagnosis 4. Is caring for an individual under a quarantine or isolation   order or caring for an individual who has been advised by a health care   provider to self-quarantine 5. Is caring for a child whose school or daycare is closed or   unavailable 6. Is experiencing any other similar condition specified by the   Secretary of Health and Human Services  You must also provide **an additional 10 weeks of pay** if the   employee is unable to work due to caring for a child under 18 years of age   whose school or daycare is closed or unavailable.  One employee may qualify for both types of leave.

            " That's Horrible.   As a hiring manager I may not reply if you are not a fit. But, if i called you and interviewed you, I will tell you its you not me.",
            " As a recruiter, I pride myself on open communication including the hard conversations of \u201cwe aren\u2019t hiring you.\u201d Ive answered questions like this before on here and gotten roasted, but I stand by it.   It\u2019s a combination of employers   A) hiring people or using managers with no experience recruiting. Everyone thinks it\u2019s so easy, but most recruiters don\u2019t make the cut. Many of the inexperienced recruiters can\u2019t handle the candidate reaction to a rejection so they just don\u2019t do it. Hiring managers think they are too good for admin work (and hey they are probably really busy) so once they hire someone they immediately change their focus to the next hire/fire/etc.   B) refusing to pay a little bit more money for intuitive software that at the very least automatically says \u201chey we got your info, don\u2019t call us well call you if interested.\u201d Otherwise someone actually has to go in and click things to make that happen.  C) expecting too much from recruiters. I\u2019ve worked weekends just to send mass templates rejection letters because I have too much other stuff to do during work time. It can take 5 mins per candidate to review and reject them which seems easy enough...  but if you are over worked as it is and you have 800 applicants ...it\u2019s a wild Saturday night reflecting people who don\u2019t meet even the minimum requirements but applied anyway.   It\u2019s also our culture of reality tv and swiping left. There are no consequences for not doing things the right way. A bad Glassdoor review? That really does nothing to someone who will move on to the next job in a few months.   Recruiters are also scared of making a mistake and saying something that will get them in trouble. Most won\u2019t give any feedback at all if the candidate is not a white male for fear of discrimination charges.   The crazy thing is when I call people to reject them (only if they have had a phone/in person interview) I am often hit with their wrath and loathing of the whole thing. I\u2019ve had people tell me off for 5+ minutes because OTHER recruiters don\u2019t call back about other jobs while I\u2019m rejecting them from my job. I think thinned skinned people don\u2019t deal well with it.",

I'm currently recruiting for a role in my department and posted for the job three days ago. I was careful to describe the role, the minimum qualifications required, the location, the salary range and documents required (CV & Cover Letter). It is very clear what I am looking for in a candidate.  In three days, I have received over 200 applications. Out of those, less than 30 actually met the min. qualifications and only 10 are ideal candidates. I only got 12 cover letters in total and three of those included the name of another company they applied for in the past. I have had 47 requests for \"quick chats\" about the role through LinkedIn, 14 cold calls to my phone and three Facebook friend requests from potential candidates.   I'm feeling stalked.   It will take me several hours to send rejection letters to the 170 people that should not have applied to begin with and many more fielding the onslaught of inquiries. We don't have HR as we are a smaller company so I still have a full time job to do. I know it is a part of the gig but it is frustrating dealing with the sheer volume of applicants. Especially when they start demanding feedback specifically tailored to them.   Please read the job posting and only apply if you actually meet the qualifications. That's all I ask.",

        "sft_target": " As a recruiter, I pride myself on open communication including the hard conversations of \u201cwe aren\u2019t hiring you.\u201d Ive answered questions like this before on here and gotten roasted, but I stand by it.   It\u2019s a combination of employers   A) hiring people or using managers with no experience recruiting. Everyone thinks it\u2019s so easy, but most recruiters don\u2019t make the cut. Many of the inexperienced recruiters can\u2019t handle the candidate reaction to a rejection so they just don\u2019t do it. Hiring managers think they are too good for admin work (and hey they are probably really busy) so once they hire someone they immediately change their focus to the next hire/fire/etc.   B) refusing to pay a little bit more money for intuitive software that at the very least automatically says \u201chey we got your info, don\u2019t call us well call you if interested.\u201d Otherwise someone actually has to go in and click things to make that happen.  C) expecting too much from recruiters. I\u2019ve worked weekends just to send mass templates rejection letters because I have too much other stuff to do during work time. It can take 5 mins per candidate to review and reject them which seems easy enough...  but if you are over worked as it is and you have 800 applicants ...it\u2019s a wild Saturday night reflecting people who don\u2019t meet even the minimum requirements but applied anyway.   It\u2019s also our culture of reality tv and swiping left. There are no consequences for not doing things the right way. A bad Glassdoor review? That really does nothing to someone who will move on to the next job in a few months.   Recruiters are also scared of making a mistake and saying something that will get them in trouble. Most won\u2019t give any feedback at all if the candidate is not a white male for fear of discrimination charges.   The crazy thing is when I call people to reject them (only if they have had a phone/in person interview) I am often hit with their wrath and loathing of the whole thing. I\u2019ve had people tell me off for 5+ minutes because OTHER recruiters don\u2019t call back about other jobs while I\u2019m rejecting them from my job. I think thinned skinned people don\u2019t deal well with it.",

    "\n\nHuman: My manager got angry I didn't tell him about a death in my family I'm an engineer at a big tech company. I got a performance review saying I was reserved and not very social for the few weeks after a grandparent's death, which I did not inform my manager about because I felt like it was too personal, and my manager is not someone that I felt comfortable with confiding in - he is a narcissistic, boorish, inconsiderate pig of a human being who brags about himself 24/7, and constantly makes weird racist comments about my ethnicity. Can you blame me for not wanting to discuss anything deeply personal with him, and keep our relationship businesslike?  Now, I DON'T MIND getting a small ding to my performance review and I FULLY accept the consequences of not telling my boss my grandmother died, and am 100% fine with it on my record. Life happens. Jesus Christ. Furthermore, I do not give a flying shit about climbing the corporate ladder of this dull-ass dinosaur tech company.  One day he finds out, and makes me come into his office, looking a little panicked, and he seems slightly angry. He asks me why I didn't tell him about this. Now, I understand if he wants me to know that I'm \\*free\\* to tell him such things and he'll give me a break at work when things get tough in my life. He is not sympathetic, he is actively angry at me. It's clear to me that he's just worried about how it makes \\*him\\* look that he wrote me up for not being super social after a death in my family, but again I NEVER complained about this! He gets extremely worked up, and makes this about \\*me having poor judgment for not disclosing my personal life to him\\*, and writes something on my performance review to this effect.  Do you guys think I have done something wrong? I feel like it's MY decision to keep my personal life private if I choose to.  edit - typos\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: [SK] my coworker tried to feed me, a Muslim, pork. What can I do? Please help. Need advice. Hello, I am in Canada, Saskatchewan. So, I work at a place where I get one free meal during my shift. The cook, who nobody really likes because of his lying and spreading rumors tried to feed me pork. I am a Muslim and pork is forbidden for me. I am a very lax person and I don't usually demand for anything special or extra, just that don't give me pork.   Today the lunch menu for everyone was pork roast and he, along with EVERYONE in the kitchen knows I don't eat pork. I have been working for 2 years now and never had a problem getting an alternate even from him.   However, today he decided that he would lie to me and tell me the pork on the plate was actually beef roast. There is no way beef can look that white and I had some doubts so I asked the other cook who came in for the night shift. The other cook confirmed its pork and so did the other servers. But he kept on insisting that it's beef and that I should trust him and he would NEVER feed me pork.   I still threw out the meat and only ate the veggies and potatoes.   Later, the night shift cook comes to me and tells me that he tried to talk to the other guy and he still kept denying it.   What can I do in this situation? I am at a loss. I feel violated and I am so sad that he would try to do that to me unprovoked. I don't even work in his department where you might think I may have pissed him off.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Underperforming Manager [CA] Is there something I am missing from a California HR perspective that might explain the lack of action regarding this situation?  Seven months ago, we hired someone who seemed a perfect fit coming from the same industry. He was very articulate / knowledgeable and was able to answer every question with depth and fluidity. The position was a step up from Senior Marketing Manager to Director and he was to lead a product launch for us. We\u2019re based in California but due to COVID did not require him to move from the East.  Despite being a multinational company we\u2019re small and wear a lot of hats. Every group that interviewed him explained this repeatedly. The new product was virtually the same he said he had launched several times before.  He had trouble getting started. We\u2019d try to help and recommend what to start and why. We gave examples. I made several attempts to on-board him, but he pushed me off. The VP (who used to run Marketing) was forced to sit in on multi-hour meetings 2x a week to work through his deliverables. The VP would ask what he finished since we last met and he\u2019d say \u201cnothing\u201d. He has not had one meeting with anyone that wasn't specifically related to a part of the project he was working on. Those meetings were maybe 15 minutes. When he does step in it's usually an overstep like cancelling a meeting I booked with a vendor because he didn't understand why I needed it. He can\u2019t create a PowerPoint. He said he could write he can't. He doesn't know how to track projects, nor specs and verbiage. He does not know how to write a creative brief, nor did he know why one is needed. He doesn't know how to manage a budget. He was $20K over - to sustain a program, we need to come in 30% under. In this case that was a $60K discrepancy. This was explained early on. He did not know that he was supposed create a go-to-market plan. We asked him who he thought would be doing it and he named somebody not even working on this launch. He was late on every deliverable. We're not talking hours or days - weeks late. There was always the promise that we would receive the final within the next hour or the next day or Wednesday or by 4:00 PM or or or. After much delay he would admit he didn't understand the assignment and he needed some guidance which meant someone else would step in and do it HE LIES - says things are done and they're not started. He says he can't open the document that he got from the agency, but it turns out the agency has never been briefed. He flat out lies about everything to everyone. Our agencies are frustrated. He does not follow; he does not lead, and he doesn't get out of the way. He has made all our jobs so much more difficult. During these 6-7 months, I was put in charge of our nascent Hispanic marketing efforts, new lead generation efforts, and was solely responsible for the launch of our new corporate website. I am also responsible for packaging, product naming, internal creative direction, photography, special \u2018corporate\u2019 projects as well as social media strategy with one direct report for that task. I was also co-lead with my boss on the launch of this product. And, since he did not create a go to market plan, I pulled together a 13-page plan and a new way to track projects and budgets - All of which I shared with the VP.  Several people in and out of Marketing have spoken to the VP who had been an AWSOME Marketing boss especially for someone without a Marketing background. I clearly outlined the issues and outcomes and what I am seeing behind the scenes. At this point, I can't say anything else. The VP is not seeing what everyone else is.  Is there something I am not understanding about employment law and firing someone who is not performing?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: My boss told me I should file a complain in HR today... I work in Finance at a company in NY.  I don't want to give out too much information, but a group of 4 people were hired ~two years ago and took away most of my responsibilities.  My boss has been fighting for a long time to get some back and two weeks ago was a major win for me/him.  But, this group has been going out of their way every day to create trouble and run to the president of the company, blowing this way our of proportion.  Going back a bit now.  I've always been nice to them, trying to help in any way possible.  They have not been the same to me.  They have tried to kick me out and restrict my duties in any way imaginable.  There was an incident in the summer (don't want to go into specifics) but the leader of their group actually tried to get me fired over it (failed obviously).  I want to make it clear that they are not my bosses.  We've all been directed to work together, but again I do not work FOR them, but rather WITH them.  Another incident happened today and another member of their group made multiple statements about how they are my bosses and I need to \"jump off a bridge\" for them.  Well obviously I don't/won't.  He also said that I should be fired for insubordination in a conversation to my boss today.  They talk down to me, and on multiple occassions gang up 3v1 on me to \"put me in my place\".  Almost every day for the past two weeks I come home angry/upset.  I can deal with their nonsense but the fact that it does affect me after work does raise an eyebrow.  My boss mentioned going to HR as a tactic to use against them in our advantage for gaining more power.  I think I do have an actual claim of harassment from them (with almost all of our conversations being over an instant messenger so all recorded).  I'm considering going this route now.    I came here for guidance on whether I should actually do it.  I think there is enough to justify harassment.  I do not appreciate the way any of them talk to me (always talking down and very negative).  I have multiple examples of this.  Nothing specific like name calling, sexual harrassment, etc. but the way they simply talk to me.  Is this viable?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Advice: My friend confided in me that she found possible racist notes about herself in our HR system. Help! Backstory: I\u2019m a corporate recruiter and I\u2019ve been with the company for 2 years. About a year ago we hired an HR generalist and, though she has a lot more HR experience than me, she\u2019s relied on me to help her get acclimated to how our company runs. I\u2019m really close with her and we have a great working relationship and we both love it here. We had an HRM who was very bitchy and a kiss-ass to our VPHR and SVPHR and she left recently to raise a family.   My friend was recently promoted to HRM from Generalist and with that, comes access to a system that tracks/has notes on high level hires for our company (the previous HRM and VPHR and SVPHR are some of the few people that have access to this system).   My HRM just confided in me that when she got access to the system, she searched herself (to see what pertinent info needed to be added to new entries). In the notes section of her file was \u201cSr lvl HRG from competitor - Token\u201d. Being that she is a black lady, she was immediately upset to think she was only hired for diversity, not for her experience. She is the only black person on our team.   She called me and asked for advice and I\u2019m not even sure where to begin. I can only imagine what she\u2019s feeling. The former (bitchy) HRM was the person entering information previously, (and she\u2019s no longer with us) but we can\u2019t track who made the notes...  State: NY\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: [MA] Sick time used counted against me for my yearly performance review. I'm a project manager who just hit my 2 year mark with a moderate sized business. (200-250 employees).  Just received my end-of-year review and scored a 9.2/10 on the metrics handled, was lauded for my success with not just my team but others.  Thanked for putting in a large amount of extra work (and was compensated for it) but in the end was told my sick time counted against me in the end.  &#x200B;  My raise was lowered, I was not told an exact number, but was told it's something to keep in mind going into the new year.  They mentioned that they encourage people to use sick time, but using it all is how the metric is scored and there is nothing they can do.  Is this okay?  It feels like it shouldn't be, as I have no control of whether or not I get sick and I had multiple weeks where I worked close to 60 hours to make sure we hit our goals.  (I don't mind doing this extra work, they compensate well for it and are great about keeping us at 40 or under for all but maybe 6 weeks of the year).    &#x200B;  It was very odd to hear this considering the company has taken good care of me, but now this makes me sour thinking I can't get sick.  Last year I used all 40 hours, the first year I did not use any.   I suffer from very severe migraines a few times a year and made them aware of this due to the severity of them. (The only warning I have is my vision blurring/vertigo and about 2 minutes at most to find somewhere to laydown for 2-10 hours in black/silence, medication helps and occasionally I am good after 2-3 hours, these occur less than 6 times a year and rarely more than once a month.) Last year I had a 3 day stretch in March where I was out, followed by an additional 2 days in October where I came down with food poisoning.    &#x200B;  Sorry for all the extra info, not sure if it means anything.  I know some states don't protect your sick time, but seems odd they can lower my raise for using time given.\n\nAssistant:": {

Shariah law in Islam is an example of this, but so are legal systems predicated on Divine Rule- the authority of the sovereign gives weight to law, but since the sovereign gains their authority through appointment by God the ultimate source of normative weight is God, etc.  Positive Law, on the other hand, emphasises the *posited* nature of law- that is, law count as *law*, as opposed to just someone making claims, because it is posited as such. The most extreme version of this is John Austin's view of law, which is simply that might makes right- most actual positive law, however, consists of the project of moving away from natural law *without* having to just accept Austin's simplistic account of power, often called the \"command\" theory of law (how simplistic Austin's views are is up for debate, but he is often presented as the \"bad\" version of legal positivism, which most positivists emphatically argue they themselves are not).  Legal Positivism arguably has two main projects inherent in it. The first, stemming from Austin, is the \"scientific\" study of law, mirroring the move of many other fields of social study towars scientism in the period. Natural Law is constantly concerned with how you can evaluate laws and claims at authority vis a vis a set standard of morality. Positive Law sees this as unprofessional and biased, attempting to study law on its own terms.  The second project emerges from a problem in the first. If you are not going to set an external standard of justification, how will you distinguish what is law, and what is not?

This question leads us to seek on what basis law can, if no shared or universal moral code is accepted beforehand, can be *law*, I.e. a command that holds *authority* and *normative weight*.  Answers to this have gone through custom, procedure, reasonability, etc, and there is still debate as to what can fill this gap.

This effect of objects on our sensibility is sensation, which constitutes the matter of our intuitions (B34). In the Transcendental Aesthetic, Kant argues that space and time are the form of our intuitions. He establishes this claim by first arguing that space and time are *a priori* intuitions (in the metaphysical expositions), and then arguing that they can only be *a priori* intuitions insofar as they are the *a priori* forms of sensibility (in the transcendental expositions).  Concepts are general, and mediately relate to objects by way of a mark (for example, the concept of a mug is related to an object through the object's toroidality, etc.). Concepts unify intuitions with common marks, and this unification is actively determined through our forms of judgment. The concept of a tree mediately relates to objects in the sense that we actively unify the intuitions of various types of trees in accordance with the common marks of trunks, branches, leaves, etc.  So, we can certainly have a concept of space and time (indeed, in the Transcendental Aesthetic, Kant refers to his metaphysical and transcendental expositions as expositions of the concepts of space and time), but this is just a way of discursively understanding the properties of space and time qua forms of intuition. Kant's key claim in the Aesthetic is that space and time are *originally* intuitions, so that though we can form concepts of them, given the specific marks of these concepts they must derive from prior intuitions.

            " as brobunn said, best place to start is Plato, id recommend apology as the first thing you read, and also its a good idea to stay away form jowett translation (the Hackett Complete Works edited by Cooper is good). Republic is a must read. If you're into cosmology you will probably like metaphysics.

    "\n\nHuman: What actually determines which Kantian maxim it is that we act on? This is loosely inspired by at least two objections to Kant.  The first is Parfit's rarity objection. If you steal from someone, your maxim might be \"I will steal from anyone I can in order to become rich\". Obviously immoral, on any of the CIs. But if instead the maxim is \"I will steal from women wearing a white dress eating a strawberry while reading the last page of *La Peste* in order to become rich.\" Then this seems to pass FLN, and may be fine on other formulations (depending on your view of how they are related).  The second is a past exam question \"How much of a problem is it for Kant that agents can intend the same action under a variety of descriptions?\". So again, we have a case where maybe on one formulation the act is wrong, but on another it is fine. How are we to decide between them? What makes it the case that we are acting on one maxim rather than another?     Maxims are formulated in terms of willing an action in circumstances to further and end or goal.   So I suppose my question could be broken down into three questions:  What is the action being evaluated? Am I killing someone or just stabbing a hunk of flesh? Is the downward swing immoral but taking the knife out allowed? How are actions individuated? This seems to be a concern for e.g. Hobbesian views of freedom, why not here?     What are the relevant circumstances? Is it the entire state of the world at the time? My immediate surroundings? Only certain features of them?    What makes one thing my end or goal rather than another? That I take it to be?     Obviously, there are intuitive answers to many of these questions. I'm also aware that at least some of these are general problems that are faced by other ethical and even epistemological theories, though I'm not sure that always gives Kant carte blanche. I'm interested in principled answers which explain, for instance, why the maxim involved in lying to a bank and lying to a Nazi are the same and not fine-grained enough to mark a difference between the two, why we can't just endlessly redescribe the maxim we act on until we find one that might moral and so on. Thank you!\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Is Empire by Negri and Hardt something you can just go into with an intermediate knowledge of Marx and Foucault or is it something I should find a secondary source to help me with? Just doing some revision for my upcoming exams and I was wondering if Empire was something that could give me something interesting to talk about for my International Relations exam (I know this is technically politics, but there's enough of an overlap for this to be relevant here I feel).  I've heard that the main influences on Hardt and Negri are Marx and Foucault. I have a fair bit of experience with both of them (have read one or two full books from them, and a ton of essays and secondary literature), but is that enough to get through the book without too much difficulty? Obviously it's just something I'm interested in; I don't want to spend ages trying to decipher the ideas directly, and if it's something that would take more than a few days dedicated reading to get through I'd rather just read a good secondary text on it and a few relevant chapters from the book.

            " I see a lot of great answers here anchored in a more analytic/Anglo-American tradition, so I thought I'd add my two cents from a slightly different tradition. Short answer is that I think its the wrong question. The right question would be what it means to depict a literary work in a true or false way: What authority undersigns the veracity of one reading relative to another? Can a \"misreading\" nonetheless be faithful to the text?      I think that the \"death of the author\" argument had become something of a parody these days, and not without reason. Yet I think if you actually read Barthes' text, and the texts that came out of French avant garde literary circles in the second half of the 20th century, the argument is actually a pretty interesting one.   At the most basic level you have an epistemological issue: how do we know what the author intended? I think this is the most common *mis*reading of the death of the author argument, and really does boil down to a kind of fallacious reasoning that is well deserved of its criticism. We might not know exactly what an author intended, but we can pretty well infer a reasonable amount of intent (and an amount of things certainly not intended).      The more robust version of the argument contains three principle parts, which I think rather play off each other (and I have attempted to put them in logical order)   1. The author's intention is not authoritative for the text; rather it is the reader's interpretation that gives life to a text. The meaning is not set down once and for all by the author, but brought into the \"here-and-now\" by the act of reading in which the reader makes sense of a text by relating it to their own experiences (including other experiences of reading). This means that there is no \"true\" or \"false\" reading of a literary text insofar as the nature of the text is to be reconstructed in the present of the reader. There are certainly good and bad readings, or readings that are more or less faithful to a certain idea of the text. But when I think of Sherlock adaptations (particularly the Benedict Cumberbatch one), I don't think of them as false readings, but as creative interpretations of characters that bring them out of the moral strictures of victorian England and allow characters like Mary or Irene to express themselves in much stronger ways.  2. Texts are not single-layered, but inevitably multivalent and even polyphonic. That is, there is not just a single linear-story, but a fabric of socio-cultural and political threads in simultaneous operation. The author does not write with a single voice, but takes on multiple perspectives over the course of a story, and therefore records testimony of which he/she is not aware.. (I think a particularly good example here is in the Benedict Cumberbatch Sherlock, there is an episode where they revert the setting to victorian times and Mary's character is made more traditional on the logic that even if she had the sorts of desires she did in the present day, she would not have been able to pursue them. The question, therefore, is whether the person who devised the updated Mary Watson character falsely depicted her, or if their interpretation was merely one in which the socio-cultural milieu has shifted and hence new interpretive possibilities are available).  3. The authority of the author is based on the notion of an intention, which records only a piece of the subjectivity of the person who penned the story. Here we have to pay attention to the unconscious dimension of writing; to writing as the inscription of the unconscious of the author There are therefore elements of every literary and even philosophical text which can reveal more than intended, or more than an author would even have wanted (to the point of them being things such that the author would even strongly disavow). Yet it would be strange to call these \"false\" interpretations of a text just because the author didn't mean for someone to find these elements there. Similarly, the unconscious of the reader comes into play and finds meaning in places that the author may or may not have. Yet there is no way of deciding whether these are \"really there\" or just \"projected into\" the text, because we lack a standard for judgement.  For example: I remember when I was a young teenager being shocked by the brutal and crude vulgarity of the way in which GRR Martin wrote sex scenes, particularly in his apparently consistent and insistent use of the words \"cunt\" and \"cock\" in third person narrative description. Perhaps he found finds these words to be more sexually charged, perhaps the vulgarity of these words adds to the brutal sexual politics of Westeros, or, perhaps there is a certain insecurity in these scenes--a sexual anxiety-- which caused the author to substitute the staccato brutality of these words for his usual, viewpoint focused, more tonally smooth prose style. Or, maybe, in this reading is only revealed my own dislike of these words; my own sexual anxiety. It breaks my identification with the story; feels jarring because mine is a cultural context in which \"cunt\" is vulgar and \"cock\" often belongs to two-bit pornographic scripts. Of course, sex in GoT was a huge issue in the TV adaptation, and they certainly included a lot more of it that GRRM described. But, funnily enough, when I read the books prior to the show coming out, the sexual explicitness stood out to me. The interpretation which \"falsely\" amplified the sexual content of the books felt nonetheless faithful to my experience of reading them."

    "\n\nHuman: What did atheists believe before the theory of evolution? Nowadays it is accepted among scientists that the most plausible explanation for the complexity and diversity of life on this planet is evolution. The idea of evolution existed before Darwin such as Lamarck's theory of evolution, but it was only after Darwin that our modern understanding took hold. What did prior atheists of which there were many think about this big problem concerning the breathtaking complexity of life? Even Richard Dawkins said, \"I could not imagine being an atheist at any time before 1859 when Darwin\u2019s *Origin of Species* was published\".  **Note: I am aware that evolution not being true doesn't automatically mean that there is a god, but I am just curious as to what did the atheists think before evolution was presented.**\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Firstly, although we take it for granted now, the idea that nature moves from simple to complex and that we understand it by understanding that process, is not the way people always thought about these things, but rather a worldview that really starts to take hold only as recently as the 19th century. In this sense, that we see evolutionary theory bourgeoning in the 19th century is not to be explained as some event causing us to arrive at explanations we've long failed to have, but rather is a -- in historical terms -- a fairly natural consequence of changes in what we think explanation is. (Or, rather, the two factors interconnected in complex ways.) For a long time before this period, people were often inclined to think of nature as more or less like it seems to be, and of explanation to involve a description of the state we find nature in, rather than of trying to explain how this state came from something simple.  Now, of course, the real history is more complex than this simple juxtaposition suggests, and the two modes of explanation often coexisted and interrelated in complex ways, but in general there was previously a much stronger tendency towards descriptive accounts of nature, and especially in the 19th century there develops a pervasive tendency towards a model of nature as progressing from simple to complex. The classical example of the former, in this case, would be Aristotelian natural philosophy, where nature is more-or-less in a steady state (at least, a kind of somewhat chaotic but self-correcting equilibrium) and biological kinds are eternal: we don't need to explain where oaks \"came from\", since as a kind they didn't come from anywhere, and as individuals they just come from other oaks, all there is to do is describe what an oak is and how it relates to other things in nature.  In this case, while atheism was of course much less prevalent and influential prior to the 19th century, there wasn't any principled or obvious problem about atheism posed by the question of the diversity of life, because the kinds of questions to which evolutionary theory is an answer weren't being asked.  The second thing to consider, as /u/mooninjune rightly points out, is that many philosophers and other thinkers felt that they had in principle reasons to think that nature proceeded mechanically, such that we have principled reasons to expect that a mechanical cause exists for any change we see in nature, even if as a matter of our particular knowledge we happen not to know what that cause is. Now, this sort of approach often overlapped with the former issue, so that we had thinkers who both weren't asking the questions evolutionary theories answered *and* who, *had they asked these questions*, would regard themselves as having good reasons to expect a mechanical explanation for the diversity of life, like the one evolution provides. In the latter case, they would be inclined to accept that there is such a cause, though they don't know it, and in that sense not know what to believe, except that they believe there is such a cause that perhaps scientists one day will find.  The third thing to keep in mind, as /u/mediaisdelicious rightly notes, is that evolutionary thinking in something like we recognize it today starts to take shape in the late 18th century, so that there's already a lot of it going on before Darwin ever gets on the scene. *Origin of Species* is of course a monumental accomplishment, but it's not the unprecedented bolt out of the blue that a particularly ideological-minded populizer like Dawkins presents it as being. On these sorts of grounds, an atheist at least during the earlier part of the 19th century would plausibly take themselves to have grounds to affirm evolutionary theory, though it wasn't a particularly Darwinian form of evolutionary theory -- but such a theory not being Darwinian does not tend to pose any particular problem for the atheist.",

The classical example of the former, in this case, would be Aristotelian natural philosophy, where nature is more-or-less in a steady state (at least, a kind of somewhat chaotic but self-correcting equilibrium) and biological kinds are eternal: we don't need to explain where oaks \"came from\", since as a kind they didn't come from anywhere, and as individuals they just come from other oaks, all there is to do is describe what an oak is and how it relates to other things in nature.  In this case, while atheism was of course much less prevalent and influential prior to the 19th century, there wasn't any principled or obvious problem about atheism posed by the question of the diversity of life, because the kinds of questions to which evolutionary theory is an answer weren't being asked.  The second thing to consider, as /u/mooninjune rightly points out, is that many philosophers and other thinkers felt that they had in principle reasons to think that nature proceeded mechanically, such that we have principled reasons to expect that a mechanical cause exists for any change we see in nature, even if as a matter of our particular knowledge we happen not to know what that cause is. Now, this sort of approach often overlapped with the former issue, so that we had thinkers who both weren't asking the questions evolutionary theories answered *and* who, *had they asked these questions*, would regard themselves as having good reasons to expect a mechanical explanation for the diversity of life, like the one evolution provides. In the latter case, they would be inclined to accept that there is such a cause, though they don't know it, and in that sense not know what to believe, except that they believe there is such a cause that perhaps scientists one day will find.  The third thing to keep in mind, as /u/mediaisdelicious rightly notes, is that evolutionary thinking in something like we recognize it today starts to take shape in the late 18th century, so that there's already a lot of it going on before Darwin ever gets on the scene. *Origin of Species* is of course a monumental accomplishment, but it's not the unprecedented bolt out of the blue that a particularly ideological-minded populizer like Dawkins presents it as being. On these sorts of grounds, an atheist at least during the earlier part of the 19th century would plausibly take themselves to have grounds to affirm evolutionary theory, though it wasn't a particularly Darwinian form of evolutionary theory -- but such a theory not being Darwinian does not tend to pose any particular problem for the atheist.",

Well, up till here it might seem like classical capitalism, however, the Church recognises that in a capitalistic society man is hardly 'free' in selling their labour. Labour, according to the church has a 'free and personal' character, but also a 'necessary' character. 'Free and personal' in the sense that man should be able to sell it as they please, but it is necessary to survive. These two can be 'thought seperately', even though they aren't seperate in reality. One must be able to live of their work.

    "\n\nHuman: Why do so many philosophy texts seem to have an aversion to providing specific examples in addition to abstract definitions and statements and how does one deal with it? As a learner, it drives me crazy and it makes it unnecessarily difficult to progress. Last week, I read a text on the philosophy of science that says falsification has become outdated as a demarcation criterion for what is or isn't science because it wrongfully excludes good science and includes bad science. Then the text simply moves on with explanations as if there was nothing more to say and doesn't name a single example of either. Why would you EVER make a statement like this and not add examples?  Not only would examples make it easier to understand what's going on, they'd also back up the claim being made and basically be arguments at the same time. I'm not even convinced that this is true, but if I'd been given two examples of each case, I'd buy it and probably remember it. As it is, I'm left with a claim I don't understand and doubt about its truth. What's the reasoning behind this and how does one deal with it?\n\nAssistant:": {

When I was writing my undergraduate dissertation on the philosophy of fiction this was something I ran into frequently. One author with whom I otherwise *broadly* agreed (forget his name or the paper) used only the example of narrative conjunction and disjunction in the three books of *Lord of the Rings* to make his case that there are not really truths in fiction.  On the other hand, the case of Popper and similarly towering figures is more about academic politics: the material which supposedly undermines Popper is so well-known amongst the cognoscenti that it is generally taken as read. Popperians still exist but they are in the minority, and the stories that are told *about* Popper\u2019s work - true or not - are generally taken as read.

And that's actually closer to the common-sense view most of us hold today. After all, if I asked you, \"When does X exist?\" you would probably say, \"Well, when some matter comes together in an X-like form.\" And that's what Aristotle thought too!   As an example, consider a chair. The *matter* of the chair is wood, but the *form* of the chair is the way that wood has been organized to produce something that is a chair. The form of the chair exists, but only in the sense that it exists *in the chair itself*; this inverts Plato's metaphysics, which would say that the chair only really exists so far as it has relation with the Form.   In general, you should think of the form (or at least the substantial form) of a thing as the way the matter that comprises that thing has to be in order for the thing to be itself. The material that comprises a chair could be wood or steel or cardboard or diamond, but without a particular *form*, it would cease to be a chair at all.

    "\n\nHuman: If we have a moral imperative to self quarantine, do we have an imperative not to drive cars? It seems that if you're making the argument that we must self quarantine against the corona virus and that you are morally responsible if you infect someone with it (which I would agree with) then we must self quarantine and abstain from many practices that we commonly participate in, perhaps not driving being one of them.   If we compare the amount of deaths caused by car accidents globally with the global death toll of corona viruses cases, about 83,000 people die every month from car accidents and about the same amount of people have died from corona virus in several months. These obviously aren't completely analogous, but it seems that if it's a serious imperative for one thing, then the other ought to be an imperative in its own right. I'm not proposing that everyone needs to stop driving their car because I understand how impractical that would be, but maybe if we thought about it in this way and attempted to walk or bike, perhaps take public transportation where we could, we might be better off, beyond the obvious environmental benefits. Do you think that's off? It seems right to me.  It seems to me even more clear that if this argument for self quarantining is being made then we must donate large amounts of money to charity and go vegan, amongst other things that I doubt many of the people making said argument would be willing to do.\n\nAssistant:": {

It's always going to be risky to some degree, and you can't abstain from driving for a few weeks and come back with a reduced risk of accidentally killing someone.

And then, despite being similar enough to our universe to produce all of those events exactly the same way, something different enough has to happen for your counterpart to acquire one?  Many of the theories of infinite universes will say that these universes vary only in terms of their physical laws and their initial conditions. If these things are similar enough to our actual universe to provide everything leading to Lamborghini in 1973, then it's a bit hard to see how things could go slightly differently afterwards in these particular ways, unless you *almost* got such a vehicle once.  To lead to Raquel Welch, something even more similar needs to have been the case. I don't know your romantic history, and whether you went on a first or second date with her at the relevant age (or even if your age is right to line up with her at age 33), but it seems unlikely that there could be a universe so similar as ours to produce Raquel Welch herself while ending up differently.  On the other hand, it would be much easier for a universe to be vastly different from ours, but produce someone that looks a lot *like* Raquel Welch (and maybe even has a name pronounced rather similarly) that goes out on a three dates with someone who looks and acts an awful lot like you, but with a totally different history of life on earth leading up to it.",

            " Depends what you're asking.  If you're asking why people work *at all*, that's pretty easy. We do that because if we *don't* work, our lives will be a lot *shorter* than they would be otherwise. Simply put: don't work? Don't eat. That's often used as some kind of moral maxim, but I'm using it in a purely descriptive sense here. For vast majority of humanity over the vast majority of history, the only way to keep one's self from starving to death was to work. There may have been a fortunate few who were rich enough to avoid that, but not very many.   More philosophically, there are a variety of theories as to why work is important. Both virtue ethicists and Marxists would say that engaging in productive work is an important part of what it means to be human, though they generally have different ways of articulating that. For many moral theorists, there's an important connection between labor and property rights, meaning one who does not work won't have much of a claim to eat (the moral version of the aphorism above). For others, there's some sense of moral obligation to support one's self to the best of one's ability, so as not to be a burden upon one's family or society as a whole. Etc. Many if not most moral philosophers have considered work to be morally significant, even if there is quite a diversity of perspectives as to how that works itself out.   But you might be asking why so many of us seem to work jobs that we hate. That's a different question, and there are many different answers to that one too. Marx himself had a lot to say about exploitation and alienation, viewing capitalists' profiting from the labor of workers as immoral, oppressive, and exploitative. So there's a moral failure here, but it'd be mostly on the part of capitalists and/or the bourgeoisie. But even many philosophers more-or-less friendly to capitalism recognize a moral failure in choosing to work a job one despises for inadequate reasons. Say there's a man with a job that requires very long hours, to the point that his relationships and other pursuits really suffer. If that is the only job he could possibly do that would permit him to support himself and his family, that might be excusable. But if he could very easily work a different job that lets him *be a better person* while still meeting whatever obligations he might be said to have? That starts to look like a moral failing of one sort or another.",
            " Writ small, because having money lets us do other stuff.  Beyond that, being part of something bigger (society) and being productive can be rewarding things in themselves, even if the actual job itself sucks and we have to fall back purely on wanting money to get through life with--since most of us don't want to spend all of our efforts providing shelter and food for ourselves (which would be the extreme other alternative if no one did other jobs--and would likely suck even more which is why we go the way we do by and large).",
            " I would say it's very characteristic of those who live in a capitalist society. Rather, it's not inherent of the people but of the values instilled upon us. In such a society, we equate money to happiness. This has a variety of facets in itself; social hierarchies, resources, even the way in which we place value upon ourselves and those around us. One is successful, therefore \"flourishing,\" if they possess the adequate resources to affirm themselves in a social hierarchy in a way that they and those around them find to be sufficient for success. The value they place upon themself is reflective of their place in the social hierarchy, in particular, how they feel they should lie in such a social hierarchy. Thus, lives are spent working towards affirming our own value by seeking \"success,\" and as a direct result a sufficient place within the social hierarchies that one finds valuable. In other words, we are enriched with ideas that govern the way in which people should live their lives and we often live our lives satisfying such expectations. These ideas are often reflective of money equating the good life, or as money being the resource that being these ideas in fruition.",

In a just society, socially-necessary labor would be performed by those who were capable of it and the products of that labor distributed communally to those who were in need of them.

        "sft_target": " Depends what you're asking.  If you're asking why people work *at all*, that's pretty easy. We do that because if we *don't* work, our lives will be a lot *shorter* than they would be otherwise. Simply put: don't work? Don't eat. That's often used as some kind of moral maxim, but I'm using it in a purely descriptive sense here. For vast majority of humanity over the vast majority of history, the only way to keep one's self from starving to death was to work. There may have been a fortunate few who were rich enough to avoid that, but not very many.   More philosophically, there are a variety of theories as to why work is important. Both virtue ethicists and Marxists would say that engaging in productive work is an important part of what it means to be human, though they generally have different ways of articulating that. For many moral theorists, there's an important connection between labor and property rights, meaning one who does not work won't have much of a claim to eat (the moral version of the aphorism above). For others, there's some sense of moral obligation to support one's self to the best of one's ability, so as not to be a burden upon one's family or society as a whole. Etc. Many if not most moral philosophers have considered work to be morally significant, even if there is quite a diversity of perspectives as to how that works itself out.   But you might be asking why so many of us seem to work jobs that we hate. That's a different question, and there are many different answers to that one too. Marx himself had a lot to say about exploitation and alienation, viewing capitalists' profiting from the labor of workers as immoral, oppressive, and exploitative. So there's a moral failure here, but it'd be mostly on the part of capitalists and/or the bourgeoisie. But even many philosophers more-or-less friendly to capitalism recognize a moral failure in choosing to work a job one despises for inadequate reasons. Say there's a man with a job that requires very long hours, to the point that his relationships and other pursuits really suffer. If that is the only job he could possibly do that would permit him to support himself and his family, that might be excusable. But if he could very easily work a different job that lets him *be a better person* while still meeting whatever obligations he might be said to have? That starts to look like a moral failing of one sort or another.",
        "rejected_target": " I would say it's very characteristic of those who live in a capitalist society. Rather, it's not inherent of the people but of the values instilled upon us. In such a society, we equate money to happiness. This has a variety of facets in itself; social hierarchies, resources, even the way in which we place value upon ourselves and those around us. One is successful, therefore \"flourishing,\" if they possess the adequate resources to affirm themselves in a social hierarchy in a way that they and those around them find to be sufficient for success. The value they place upon themself is reflective of their place in the social hierarchy, in particular, how they feel they should lie in such a social hierarchy. Thus, lives are spent working towards affirming our own value by seeking \"success,\" and as a direct result a sufficient place within the social hierarchies that one finds valuable. In other words, we are enriched with ideas that govern the way in which people should live their lives and we often live our lives satisfying such expectations. These ideas are often reflective of money equating the good life, or as money being the resource that being these ideas in fruition."

            " 17th rationalists like Descartes thought we had certain *innate* ideas. Like that of God, for example. Here's his famous argument for God's existence which is predicated upon this idea of innate ideas:  1. There are two species of reality: actual and representative. The actual reality is that of the substance in something. Representative reality is the reality of the substance which another represents. (e.g. a clump of clay shaped liked a fox has the representative reality of a fox).  2. In these two species of reality, there is a degree. Some things are actually more real than others (I am more real than a dream) and some represent more reality than others.  3. *Principle of Causality*: An effect cannot have more reality, either representative or actual, than the cause, only less or as much as. *Proof: If the reality of an effect exceeds that of the cause, the excess of reality came from nothingness, which is contradictory.*  4. I have ideas in my mind, and of their existence I am immediately aware of, even if they are fictional, i.e. that which they represent does not exist.  5. (From 1, 2 and 4) All ideas have the same actual reality because they are mere modifications of the same substance (my mind), but since they represent different objects, their representative reality is diverse.  6. An idea must be caused to exist.  7. (From 3, 5 and 6) The cause of actual reality in an idea is always my mind, but that of representative reality, it may not be.  8. (From 3 and 7) If an idea represents more reality than that of my mind, then it was caused by something other than me.  9. My mind is a finite substance. *Proof: If my mind were infinite, I'd have perfect and absolute understanding of everything. There are things I don't or cannot understand. Therefore, I am a finite being.*  10. I have the idea of God, which is that of an infinite substance.  11. (From 8, 9 and 10) The idea of God was caused in me by something else. *Note: I cannot produce the idea of infinity through the indefinite synthesis of finite ideas, such as by a process of counting integers, because this is a mere potential infinity. The very fact that I am aware that this successive adding leads to infinity proves that I have a prior idea of actual infinity.*  12. (From 3 and 11) The idea of God, or, of an infinite substance, could only be caused by an infinite substance. Therefore God, the infinite substance, exists.  This is a fun, if rather complex and certainly unconvincing proof of the existence of God. What might interest you is proposition 11. In any case, the metaphysical applications of this doctrine of innate ideas is vast.   Locke was a famous empiricist critic of the doctrine. He opposed it to his *tabula rasa* concept, of a mind that is completely blank after formation, and gains ideas through perception.  Leibniz, another rationalist, in turn responded that if this were true, for every idea there'd be a single correspondent perception, which would present itself clearly and distinctly to the mind.   This is not true. Ideas are obscure and confuse, especially ones directly related to perception. It is that which we do not perceive directly, like numbers, which are clearest and most distinctly present in the mind. Leibniz believed this was evidence that *all* ideas are innate, but simply obscure and confuse. Perception may simply aid us in representing them more clearly and distinctly.  In any case, you should read this: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/innateness-history/  EDIT typo  EDIT 2 minor corrections  EDIT Corrected Descartes back to his time"

    "\n\nHuman: Is Anselm's Ontological argument ridiculous? I've been looking up a lot of discussion about Anselm's argument 'proving' the existence of God. A lot of these discussions get very deep very quickly, and the conclusion people generally come to in my limited experience is that the argument is, at the very least, difficult to disprove. Maybe it's true, maybe it isn't--but most people online that I've found at least think it's a decent argument.  I don't get it. To me, this argument looks utterly ridiculous. If anyone's willing to have a discussion and demonstrate that I'm mistaken, I'd really appreciate it--I may very well be missing something. So we can refer back to it, I'll write the argument below--I pulled it off of Wikipedia, so please let me know if I should edit it and change anything.  1. It is a conceptual truth (or, so to speak, true by definition) that God is a being than which none greater can be imagined (that is, the greatest possible being that can be imagined). 2. God exists as an idea in the mind. 3. A being that exists as an idea in the mind and in reality is, other things being equal, greater than a being that exists only as an idea in the mind. 4. Thus, if God exists only as an idea in the mind, then we can imagine something that is greater than God (that is, a greatest possible being that does exist). 5. But we cannot imagine something that is greater than God (for it is a contradiction to suppose that we can imagine a being greater than the greatest possible being that can be imagined.) 6. Therefore, God exists.  First of all, #2 and #5 seem fine to me. #4 seems obviously true given that #1 and #3 are true, and #6 is of course just the conclusion. Therefore, it seems to me as though any issues with the argument lie in premises #1 and #3. Specifically, it seems to me as though either the term \"greatest\" is being used in two different ways in #1 and #3, or, given any consistent definition of \"greatest,\" one of the two premises is just false.  To start off the discussion, could someone define \"greatest\" for me?  Thanks!\n\nAssistant:": {

This made me wonder: if someone wrote like them today, wouldn't history call them unintelligible, unnecessarily complex and completely dismiss them? I'm not at all attacking their ideas, I'm only trying to understand what separates their complicated (and to me sometimes, unintelligible) writing to the unintelligible writing of today. If I wrote about a Free Spirit like Nietzsche or a Dasein like Heidegger, would I be welcomed just as much by current and future eras?

            " > Take this example from one of Heidegger's essays:  >>Enframing means the gathering together of that setting-upon which sets upon man, i.e., challenges him forth, to reveal the real, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve.  >I may be completely wrong but I imagine if I wrote something like this today on this subreddit or any, the comment would be lost in oblivion. If I wrote it on a blog, someone might read it. I might even gain a following but I highly doubt any university professor of the future would take their precious time to read and analyze this.  That statement is from Heidegger's *The Question Concerning Technology,* published in 1954, well after Heidegger established himself, through three decades of prior lectures and published work, as worthy of the effort to comprehend. This essay builds on themes and language that Heidegger laid out in prior work.   For myself, I didn't quite 'get' Heidegger until I had a class in which we read Heidegger's Marburg lectures on Aristotle. Since I already had a decent background in Aristotle at the time, it was a relatively easy way into Heidegger's approach to being. I often recommend reading those lectures to those starting out on Heidegger.   > So I can't help but wonder: why did people even bother to read these philosophers in the first place? Did these philosophers become famous out of sheer luck or because of their ideas?  Because of their ideas.   > If the latter, I imagine their ideas could've been explained a 1000x better by someone else, would they not?  If by 'better' you mean to the purposes of Heidegger's philosophical project, no. The language is not arbitrarily difficult, but, rather, difficult as a consequence of the difficulty of the project.   If by 'better' you mean understandable to a lay person in everyday terms, yes. There are many introductions and summaries of Heidegger's thought, but everyday language isn't adequate to the task, so these introductions and summaries often import key terms in Heidegger's terminology with explanation."

Folks like Adorno, Benjamin, Marcuse, Fromm, etc., argue that culture needs to be subject to the same material critique that politics and economics are.  Feminist Queer, and POC Marxists, argue that there is a hint of class reductionism in Marx (usually overstated by so called \"classical Marxists\"), which is a major factor in the failure of the Marxist revolutions.

    "\n\nHuman: Why is it dark at night? (actually a physics question, I promise) I was thinking about the structure of the universe, the distance of objects close to the edge of the observable universe, Doppler shift, background radiation and stuff, and I had a sudden realization that I'm wondering about:  Given that space itself is mostly empty, and therefore colorless, is the night sky dark because of one or a combination of the following factors?  A) (this is the big one for me) the sky is mostly dark because even if we could see infinitely distant, there was a time in the early universe before there was light, and that was true for the whole universe at the time, therefore as we look back in time the more distant we see, everything is dark.  B) very distant objects and early structures are receding from us so fast that their light will never reach us.  C) light from very distant objects gets absorbed or reflected by whatever atoms or molecules get in the way, and because the distances are so insignificant great, even though space is a NEAR vacuum, there are so many atoms between us and the edge of the observable universe that most early light never makes it to us.  *Bonus thought that I also might posit as its own question: Given a distance of let's say 5 billion light years between two points in space-time, not objects just positions in the universe: Since the early days of the universe they've remained proportionally the same distance apart, but observationally would they appear more distant from each other? Because space is expanding - so the \"length or size\" of a unit of distance is expanding - for example due to the expansion of the universe the proportional distance between millimeters stays the same, but the space between subatomic particles ever so slightly grows, as does the size of a millimeter. It's still just one millimeter, but would it seem longer than it did a long time ago? Does that mean time is getting longer as well? If we define a second as so many oscillations of a certain atom, but the distance that atom has to swing is growing, does that mean that the length of a unit of time is expanding too? If a person from today were to count seconds in 5B years, would our person seem to tick seconds off too fast?*\n\nAssistant:": {

Any other belief is delusional. And I'll explain why:  When Rutherford did his famous golden foil experiment to propose the plum model, or Bohr came up with his revolutionary ideas, and Einstein proposed his famous energy mass equivalence principle, none of these guys could have imagined they would have led to the development of the most disastrous weapon in history (the atomic bomb). Einstein gave humanity the only theory of gravity, and the most perfect one too: general relativity. To imagine phenomena you've never observed in your life, and describe them with an idea as crazy as spacetime curvature, and be 100% right a century before they are experimentally proven, is superhuman level of imagination. So if Einstein himself couldn't imagine his theories would be used to make such a  weapon, it's silly of us to expect any scientist to predict the applications of their work 2 decades in the future. I wouldn't hold any scientist accountable for unethical practice, just because they were good at deriving equations that resemble our world. The Manhattan project is a different story. Scientists did experimental work and knowingly contributed to the development of a very specific thing, with their concent.  That was not science, nor did anyone really purposefully came up with very new physics theories. The math was there, what they did was engineer a bomb. Someone turns Einsteins photoelectric effect paper into solar panels for energy, and he is a good guy. Then someone turns his energy mass equivalence principle into a bomb, and he is the bad guy. I don't think any scientist is responsible for how others will expand upon their work in the future."

Stars and planets seem very likely to form in a universe that 1. has gravity and 2. has stuff, (which seems to describe the universe we live in)   Of the trillions of galaxies, each with, say, \\~100 billion stars, each star averaging who knows how many planets, each planet averaging who knows how many moons,  it seems likely that if a self replicating bit of chemistry (i.e. life) can exist, it would occur *somewhere*, before small mess ups in that replication creates new varieties of self replicating chemistry, some working some not, before eventually becoming complex and sapient and sentient.

If the 6 quarks were massless, you'd have that a quark wavefunction (ignoring all other quantum numbers such as momentum, spin, colour, anything else) would have 6 components. These are the six flavours of quark, and without the weak interactions you'd have a full SU(6) flavour symmetry rotating between these states.  However weak interactions exist and have an SU(2) symmetry, and weak-interacting particles must come in 2-plets transforming under SU(2). So our 6 dimensional space of quark states must be split in three 2D spaces, each being a 2-plet of weak SU(2), and each 2-plet being a generation of quarks. In each generation, you have two states called an up-type and a down-type state (weak isospin is respectively +1/2 and -1/2).  Now, you have lost your SU(6) symmetry (if you want to keep the 2-plets separated you cannot freely mix flavours) but you still have an SU(3) symmetry mixing the three generations. Surely a linear combination of SU(2) 2-plet is an SU(2) 2-plet. That is, you can perform simultaneous rotations of the 3 up type quarks and the 3 down type quarks.  Now when mass pops back up you have a problem. Mass is a quadratic form on our 6D space, or even more explicitly a positive-definite, symmetric 6x6 mass matrix which has no reason to be diagonal and we are interested on diagonalizing. Since we're only left with SU(3) symmetry, we cannot diagonalize a 6x6 matrix. **By convention**, we use the SU(3) symmetry to diagonalize the matrix on the up-type quarks. By this I mean we define u, c, t as the eigenstates of the mass matrix.  The mass matrix is *not* diagonal on the down-type quarks. After the SU(3) rotation that diagonalized the mass matrix, we have no symmetry left and to the three quarks u, c, t there's three down-like states associated by being in the same 2-tuplet, these are called d', s', b' and they are the so called weak eigenstates.  These do not have a definite mass as the mass matrix is not diagonal in the d', s', b' basis. However weak interactions are easy because u turns into d' and so on.  *If* you diagonalized the mass matrix on the down-type quarks you'd mess up the 2-plets but you'd get three quarks d,s,b with definite mass, the mass eigenstates. As the 2-plets are mixed, d could through weak interactions turn into any of u, c, t.  So d,s,b and d',s',b' are not the same states, but they're connected by a rotation given by the CKM matrix. This matrix is very close, but not exactly equal, to a rotation by 13\u00b0 of d and s and the identity on b.",

            " It probably helps to think of it as just a physical use of linear algebra.  Consider a matrix M with a basis of eigenvectors { v_1 }, and a different matrix W with a basis of eigenvectors  { v_2 }. There is no reason in general that the basis { v_1 } and the basis  { v_2 } are the same if the two matrices are different. On the other hand, if M and W have the same dimension then there is a way in which you can write the basis {v _2 } in terms of { v_1 }, and this defines, say, a transformation matrix V that relates one basis to the other.  Essentially, that is all there is to it, except that instead of vectors we have particle states, and instead of matrices we have operators (but the operators *do* admit matrix representations); and V is the CKM matrix that describes the mixing from the mass basis to the weak basis.",

            " Yes, if of the infrared radiation was being absorbed, the energy from the sun would mean ever increasing temperature of the Earth. The Earth gives off radiation as it absorbs energy from the sun. Greenhouse gases like CO2, water vapor etc keep some of this energy inside the atmosphere, warming our Earth. Increased amounts of greenhouse gases means increased temperature, it's quite simple. The problem here is that if all this energy was being absorbed as your teacher says, you have an imbalanced equation, meaning the Earth would constantly heat up as energy from the sun is deposited in the Earth.",

Increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide molecules in the atmosphere means a given infrared photon's random walk is going to talk longer, as it has a greater chance of being reabsorbed & reemitted along the way. So even if it is true that the first 20ppm of atmospheric carbon dioxide absorbs \u201cmost of the light it can,\u201d and adding more carbon dioxide won't increase the amount of light it absorbs *initially*, it will increases the odds that an infrared photon is *reabsorbed* more times on it's way out of the atmosphere.  (And in fact Venus, with an atmosphere that is 96.5% carbon dioxide, has a surface temperature of 872 \u00b0F\u2014far hotter than even Mercury, which is even closer to the Sun. (Because yes, the fact that Venus is closer to the Sun than Earth would raise it's temperature all else being equal.))  This same process happens inside the Sun, though because the Sun is so incredibly dense that it takes photons a *very* long time to get to the surface of the Sun. It's thought that it takes photons [about 170,000 years to get from the core of the Sun to about 75% of the way towards the surface.  Interesting note about the effect of water vapor. For a long time it was unclear exactly what the overall effect of increased water vapor (from jet contrails) would be.  On the one hand they increase the albedo, reflecting more incident radiation back into space (cooling the Earth), but on the other hand, water vapor also absorbs infrared, delaying it from being radiated back into space.  Turns out the overall affect is warming though.  However the reason we are so much more concerned with carbon dioxide than water vapor is that the water vapor doesn't stay in the atmosphere for very long, it regularly rains back out of the sky. Whereas carbon dioxide tends to spend about a hundred years in the atmosphere.  Edit: this xkcd comic illustrates the warming, and you might find the PETM interesting to read about.

            " Yes, if of the infrared radiation was being absorbed, the energy from the sun would mean ever increasing temperature of the Earth. The Earth gives off radiation as it absorbs energy from the sun. Greenhouse gases like CO2, water vapor etc keep some of this energy inside the atmosphere, warming our Earth. Increased amounts of greenhouse gases means increased temperature, it's quite simple. The problem here is that if all this energy was being absorbed as your teacher says, you have an imbalanced equation, meaning the Earth would constantly heat up as energy from the sun is deposited in the Earth.",

Increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide molecules in the atmosphere means a given infrared photon's random walk is going to talk longer, as it has a greater chance of being reabsorbed & reemitted along the way. So even if it is true that the first 20ppm of atmospheric carbon dioxide absorbs \u201cmost of the light it can,\u201d and adding more carbon dioxide won't increase the amount of light it absorbs *initially*, it will increases the odds that an infrared photon is *reabsorbed* more times on it's way out of the atmosphere.  (And in fact Venus, with an atmosphere that is 96.5% carbon dioxide, has a surface temperature of 872 \u00b0F\u2014far hotter than even Mercury, which is even closer to the Sun. (Because yes, the fact that Venus is closer to the Sun than Earth would raise it's temperature all else being equal.))  This same process happens inside the Sun, though because the Sun is so incredibly dense that it takes photons a *very* long time to get to the surface of the Sun. It's thought that it takes photons [about 170,000 years to get from the core of the Sun to about 75% of the way towards the surface.  Interesting note about the effect of water vapor. For a long time it was unclear exactly what the overall effect of increased water vapor (from jet contrails) would be.  On the one hand they increase the albedo, reflecting more incident radiation back into space (cooling the Earth), but on the other hand, water vapor also absorbs infrared, delaying it from being radiated back into space.  Turns out the overall affect is warming though.  However the reason we are so much more concerned with carbon dioxide than water vapor is that the water vapor doesn't stay in the atmosphere for very long, it regularly rains back out of the sky. Whereas carbon dioxide tends to spend about a hundred years in the atmosphere.  Edit: this xkcd comic illustrates the warming, and you might find the PETM interesting to read about.  Edit 2: why is the link to the PETM missing\u203d https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Paleocene\u2013Eocene\\_Thermal\\_Maximum  Edit 3: added stuff at the top to make it clear I think the teacher is wrong."

    "\n\nHuman: What does Work feel like? I'm using a throwaway because I'm extremely embarassed by this question.  While I've been modeling and solving mechanical systems correctly for quite some time, it just occured to me that what I *intrinsically* thought was work is actually impulse.  Let me rephrase: for some reason, without thinking about it at all, I associated expended energy with applying constant pressure through my hands for some amount of time. My brain decided that pushing a 100kg motorcycle with a force of 100N for one second expends the same energy as pushing a 1 ton car with a force of 100N for one second. After all, I *feel* the same thing, albeit for different distances.  &#x200B;  While I'm obviously not the sharpest tool in the shed, it doesn't take a PhD to tell that's wrong. And I understand the math, and I think of the converse example of raising weights by pulleys, which absolutely makes sense to my brain. But I still can't shake the feeling that I actually don't *understand* physics, which is very painful.  So, please, any attempt to help me correctly interiorize energy, work and impulse is welcome.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " I'm gonna shoot straight with you boss. There are lots of jobs you can get with a BSc in physics. But they won't probably scratch the \"physics use\" itch you're describing.  Usually all proper \"senior scientist\" positions require a PhD. Because, believe me, graduate school makes you very familiar with exactly how much you don't know. Since physics is a mostly theoretical space, until you go to experiment (which is of course to test some theory) which then turns to engineering, you can't really formulate proper theories without going to grad school and getting that extra education. Now I don't say this to discourage you. It is just the fact of the matter. You can get many decent well-paying jobs without a higher degree. But they won't really be \"physics\" jobs because the amount of knowledge you get from undergrad doesn't even remotely compare. Everyday I'm in grad school I feel like I learn three or four times as much content that I learned in undergrad each day.   That said, since I just went straight into grad school (PhD program for biophysics) I can provide some insight with what it is like so you can maybe form a stronger opinion about it and consider it more carefully. Typically the first year or two are TOUGH. That is when you take the unspecialized courses like graduate mechanics, quantum 1 and 2, classical electrodynamics, etc. But after that, it opens wide up to something interesting. Because a PhD is a research degree, you obviously have to do some research. You find an advisor, a lab, and a subfield you want to work in. Then you REALLY are using your physics knowledge. That said, a PhD is tough, and you absolutely shouldn't do it unless you really want to do it, because you'll get burnout and will stop enjoying the subject if you aren't 100% driven to continue. Hope this helps! I wish you the best of luck with your life path!  Edit: typo",

    "\n\nHuman: How did you figure out which area of physics to specialize in? Currently a third year student. Not looking to decide right now but it seems pretty difficult to decide on a single specialty when there are a number of interesting fields, many different fields have valuable research, and I don't even know what most research avenues entail despite having attended many colloquia.  That last problem is particularly puzzling to me since how would someone know they wanted to, for example, study quantum information theory or plasma physics or biophysics or something when those fields are rather different than what is taught in most standard undergraduate curricula even including potential elective courses?  So I ask how you came to determine your desired specialty. Did you find a class interesting? Do an interesting research project? Childhood curiosity? Want to discover something particular? Random chance? Good prof? etc.  &#x200B;  Thanks\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Resources to learn enough classical field theory for QFT? I am doing my masters thesis in pure mathematics but focusing on mathematical physics. The problem given to me by my advisor comes from QFT, and although he said I don't need to know much physics to do the math we're interested in, I've noticed that it helps a lot having some physics intuition.    I tried tackling some QFT books from the outset but I ran into some problems as I don't have many of the physics prerequisites.   After being given a few book recommendations on here, I spent the past few weeks going through parts of Taylor's book on classical mechanics, and it helped tremendously in getting a feel/understanding behind Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. I would like to now shift to classical field theory (Taylor's book doesn't go into field theory, Lagrangian densities, Poisson brackets...etc). Do you guys have books you would recommend for this?  I took a look at Landau-Liftshitz but it seems to cover way more than I need for QFT. Alternatively I've seen some QFT books/lecture-notes (for example Tong's notes) that have a brief review of classical field theory. Would this be enough to get me going for QFT?\n\nAssistant:": {

The basic thermal energy balance equation for a planet's atmosphere is:  (Rate of change of thermal energy) = (Sunlight in) - (Infrared out)  For a stable climate the left side is zero and the two terms on the right balance, but not in this case.  The rate of change of thermal energy is given by the heat capacity of the atmosphere:  Rate of change of thermal energy = M Cp dT/dt  where M is the mass of the atmosphere, Cp is its specific heat capacity, and dT/dt is the rate of change of temperature.  Since the vast majority of the mass of the atmosphere is near the surface, we're just going to use the surface temperature, T = T_s.  For the infrared out term, the Stefan-Boltzmann law applies:  Infrared out = sigma A (T_e)^4  where sigma is the S-B constant, A is the surface area of the planet, and T_e is its *emission temperature*.  This is *not* the surface temperature: because of Venus's strong greenhouse effect, infrared energy from the surface is absorbed by the atmosphere before it escapes to space, and it's the colder atmosphere higher up that actually emits to space.  For Earth T_s and T_e differ by 10% or so on the Kelvin scale, but Venus's greenhouse effect is so huge that T_s = 700 Kelvin, T_e = 184 Kelvin -- a factor of 3.8.  Let's call this factor gamma = T_s / T_e.  Because this effect depends mostly on the *mass of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere*, I'm going to assume for now that this factor stays the same as the atmosphere starts to cool.  So now we've got a differential equation we can solve:  M Cp dT_s / dt = - sigma A (T_s)^4  / gamma^4  dT_s / dt = - sigma A / (M Cp gamma^4 )] (T_s)^4  Notice how Venus's large greenhouse effect (big gamma) and large mass M really slow down the cooling rate compared to Earth.

But there's a problem with my calculation: at some point in this process, parts of the atmosphere are going to hit the freezing point of CO2.  Dry ice clouds will form, dry ice snow will start to fall.  This causes a bunch of problems: on the one hand, it reduces the amount of gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect, so my assumption that \"gamma\" was constant will stop being true.  On the other hand, freezing a substance releases energy, which needs to be accounted for in my differential equation.  The first effect shortens the cooling time, the second one lengthens it.  But the equation above at least predicts that it'll be hundreds of thousands of years before Venus even gets to the point where freezing CO2 becomes an issue.  Oh, and this is just the time to cool the atmosphere itself.  The upper part of the rocky crust also needs to cool, which will lengthen the cooling time even more.

            " Yeah, most antennas are just a piece of metal.  The shape is the most important part.  Some antennas (lots, actually) have other materials in them as well, and I'll mention that after.  So: an EM wave is basically a voltage traveling through the air at the speed of light.  That's pretty unintuitive, but it becomes more obvious when you think about it.  If you could freeze time and measure the voltage (from the EM field) at any one spot, you could follow an EM wave by watching the voltage go up and down.  Now freeze time around an antenna.  Picture a normal car whip antenna, just a wire sticking straight up.  The antenna is inside the wave, and takes on that voltage.  The voltage goes up and down as the wave passes, so electrons are sucked into and out of the antenna.    The next simplest antenna is a dipole.  The voltage induced in the antenna is the red curve that moves up and down.  See how it causes electrons to flow back and forth across the resistor?  A radio measures that flow.  All the antenna does is produce that flow.  It's up to the radio to measure and amplify that flow.  In fact the antenna doesn't even provide the resistor- it's up to the radio to have the right resistance, and match exactly what the antenna is tuned to expect.  Normally this is 50 ohms.  The reason why is complicated, which is to say people argue about it a *lot*.  So, if the antenna was too big, or the wrong shape, or facing the wrong way, it might end up overlapping another part of the wave.  If that happened, electrons would flow between that part of the antenna and the other part instead of through the resistor, and you wouldn't be able to measure anything.  That's why metal heats up in a microwave.  Microwaves use very similar frequencies to a household router, but are hundreds or thousands of times more powerful.  When you expose a fork to that, it sits over a couple different waves at the same time- so the middle may be at -5 V, while the forks and handle are at +5V.  Because metal has such a low resistance (WAY lower than water), that low voltage can still cause a LOT of current to flow, and the fork gets very hot.  This is even more complicated than it sounds, and you can also get *high* voltages in this situation- those cause sparks.]  Modern antennas take advantage of that fact by carefully designing antennas to not cancel out.  You can only measure so much of the wave before it passes, so they cheat and measure several parts of the wave at once- each time removing a as much energy as possible, without cancelling anything out.  [Yagi-Uda antennas are one of the most commonly-seen antennas, and work basically like this Note: many people will call this a lie.  They are mostly right, but its a decent explanation anyways.]  Yagis are one of the special antennas- some of the cross-wires are electrically insulated, and only serve to reflect EM waves- exactly like the dish on a [parabolic antenna.  Incidentally, parabolic antennas work exactly like you would think they do.  Now we're getting into the really weird antennas.  Some of them used to be really common, and some still are, but antennas nowadays are mostly just metal shapes- we got a lot better at making them very sneaky.  Cell phone antennas, and famously iphone antennas, are often built into the metal chassis- you can see where each end is insulated from the rest of the chassis.  One extremely popular and now totally obsolete antenna is the ferrite loop.  These were used for AM radio, which is a much lower frequency than WiFi, cellular or even FM.  Lower frequency means longer wavelength- more distance between the high and low voltages.  For medium-wave Heard of shortwave?  Same idea.] that distance can be hundreds of meters, and you can't hope to make an antenna that long.  Ferrite loop antennas wrapped dozens of meters (or more!) of wire around a [ferrite rod.  The ferrite acts like a funnel for EM waves, increasing the antennas sensitivity by a huge amount.  You know how you can pick up a bunch of paperclips with a magnet?  Same deal.  Each paperclip funnels the magnetic field through itself, so it's still strong when it reaches the other end and weaker right beside the paperclip.  The ferrite loop antenna works the exact same way.  Helical antennas are another weird one: they're extremely directional, kind of like a laser for EM waves.  Usually used to track satellites, since they can be hundreds or thousands of miles away, and transmit at low power compared to earth transmitters.  Now, these things are black magic, but given the basics you can at least see *why* they work if not exactly how.  The magnetic field at different places on the helix is different, and reinforces or cancels itself out.  If the wave comes from a different direction, different spots will be cancelling.    Every bit of metal on earth acts like a little antenna, but if they aren't plugged into a radio you'd never notice.  For the most part they just absorb waves and immediately emit them back.  If the wave is much bigger than the metal, the whole object will be at the same voltage and no electricity will flow inside it.  For big metal things, electricity may flow inside them, but not enough to matter.  > In a radio, we can listen to the DJ, but how are we able to hear so audibly when the audio message is sent through radiowaves or microwaves?  Math, mostly.  AM radio is the simplest: sound controls whether or not the transmitter is on.  So when the sound wave is high, the transmitter is busily sending lots of waves out the antenna.  When its low, the transmitter turns off.  Your car radio receives those waves and turns them into another on-off signal, and uses that to control the speakers.  The exact way you do it is called envelope detection.  There are a lot of ways to do this.  One way is to use a rectifier, which is a device that turns AC waves into DC.  When the rectifier is fed fully-on 800 kHz radio, it outputs, say, ~3 V.  When it's not getting any waves it outputs 0 V.  That signal is fed from the rectifier through an audio amplifier that increases the voltage to 10+ volts and sends it to your speakers.  FM radio is ~~worse~~ more complicated.  *Hella* complicated.  So goddamn complicated we don't totally understand some things about it- like, when you lose reception on a station, why does it go from clear to static so fast?  Why doesn't the static slowly increase?  It's called the lock-on effect, but most of the reason is that the way you hear sound is weird: loud noises all sound about the same volume while quiet noises sound VERY quiet.  That's why sound is in dB (Decibels) instead of Pascals.]  Anyway, FM (Frequency Modulated) means that instead to the transmitter turning on or off, the frequency of the transmitter gets higher or lower.  Radios are very clever and can translate that very easily, and even use it to tune to stations automatically.  WiFi, cellular, and all digital radio (including the way that FM radio stations can transmit the station name, song title and artist) are all much more complex.  I could go on for hours about just [fountain codes.  The folks who do things like this have long beards (mandatory for the women too), fancy degrees and pointy hats with wide brims.  They are to be treated with respect and discouraged from talking.  Once they start going it sounds like they're casting a spell [sleep, usually]."

Some of these parts are man made (city layouts, buildings, skylines etc are all fairly regular), others natural (animal patterns, river paths, snowflakes, certain erosion patterns etc). Some are more difficult.   Depending on your level of realism, you may be ably to pull it off (eg a realistic shrub, or a realistic landscape, or realistic zebra stripe). If you want a computer to algorithmically generate a picture of your grandma at her last birthday, probably it won't work out that well.  On the other hand, you could go the brute force approach and randomly generate sequences of 1s and 0s in order to make a movie or picture.  This is nigh on impossible (actually, not impossible, just highly improbable), since the sheer number of possibilities is massive, and most of them would be junk.   So lets say you set your computer to spit out a sequence of 1,000,000 1s and 0s (this is a image of 1000x1000 pixels, and is only black and white, so 1 is black, 0 is white). You want a portrait of yourself as a result. You would have to check 9.9x10^301029 images to find it. That's a lot of images!  If we take it to extremes, and you spit out 750MB of 1s and 0s (to generate a movie for example), that number becomes   10^10^9.2  which has almost 2 billion digits.  EDIT: To give some context to the massive numbers, there is a 1000x1000 pixel image of Justin Bieber doing awful things to you. You could check 1 billion random images per second till the end of the world in 5 billion years, and the chances of a monkey typing Hamlet would still be 10^18700 greater than you finding that image.",

            " Partial melting of the substrate is uncommon (at least I'm not aware of this being common and certainly isn't the case for preserved lava flows I've seen in the field, and I can really only imagine this being possible in extremely selective settings on a very small scale where a high temperature lava, e.g. basalt, was erupted onto something with an extremely low melting point, e.g. carbonate, where you could possibly get a tiny bit of partial melting. But the lava flow will lose heat so quickly at its margins, generally it will not be able to melt other rocks). Alteration of the substrate (i.e. some amount of physical erosion, breaking up of the material from boiling of fluids, 'baking' previously unlithified sediments/soils) is very common. The wikipedia article on lava provides a little description. The base of the lava flow itself also is affected by contact with a much cooler substrate. The portions of the lava in direct contact will start to solidify (and these bits will have a very fine grained texture because they cool quickly) but the interior is still hot enough to remain liquid and so the flow continues, which will tend to rip up these partially cooled bits and drag them along (with the cooling process continuing for new bits of lava that come into direct contact with the cool substrate). This can end up leaving the base of the flow with a brecciated texture (but this is again for the volcanic material itself, not the substrate). There are lots of places where we can observe cross sections of volcanic stratigraphy to get a view of the variety of the basal contacts of lava flows. Here is an example of a paper (hopefully available to everyone, hard to tell since I'm at work) describing the volcanic stratigraphy in Iceland, which gives a lot of great details of how the texture of flows vary in cross-section and some discussion of the substrates.   Caveat: I study non-volcanic mountains, so I'm still hoping a volcanologist will show up to provide more detail.",
            " Generally by the time the lava arrives at the surface, it isn\u2019t going to be hot enough to melt the surface it lands on / flows over.   The heat is likely to trigger combustion of organic matter that it flows over (grass, flowers, wooden houses, etc), and evaporate water and so on.  But generally speaking - you have a relatively small amount of hot lava mixing with a very large amount of air and ground (or water) and it cools quickly.",
            " Soil scientist here. Soil can be (ideally) thought as being half pore space. This space is generally occupied half by air and half by water. This grants the soil a very high specific heat and resistance to deformation. Lava touching the soil surface is cooled and hardened and further lava flows overtop of it, leaving the soil largely unscathed. The soil undergoes some degree of compaction, and perhaps slight organic matter loss from combustion, but largely remains intact, buried under the lava flow.",
            " Volcanologist here,  So I'm going to assume you're talking about AA (pronounced ah-ah) and pahoehoe (pronounced pah-hoy-hoy) basaltic lava flows like those we are currently seeing in Hawaii?   Pahoehoe:  Pahoehoe lava flows are known for having very low viscosity and developing ropy textures on their flow tops. They propegate in an interesting fashion called inflation where by a lava lobe develops a visco-elastic shell in contact with the ground and air. The shell acts as an insulator, shielding the interior of the flow from releasing too much heat to the outside.  The lobe will sort of blow up like  a balloon for a while.  Once enough pressure builds from continuous effusion of lava at the vent, the lobe has a 'break out' to form a new lobe which is connected to the old one. This process of inflation continues inflating old lobes and producing new ones.  In some regions (Columbia River Flood Basalt province in the PNW), this process has created flows 100's of meters thick.  This will continues until there is no more effusion providing pressure to propegate the flow. The shells that develop do a well enough job to shield the ground from the heat.  AA:  These flows are generally a bit coolder to begin with and when they move the lava breaks and crumbles on the outside of the flow to form an 'auto-clastic flow breccia', which means that the outsides are covered in sharp prickley bits of basalt, which if you stepped on you would probably find yourself saying \"ah, ah!\" Escentially as AA lavaflows progress they generally move in conveyor belt fashion where the top of the flow moves to the front and then falls on the ground and then is ridden over by the rest of the flow.  This cooled breccia acts as an excellent insulator and protects the underlying ground from being too affected by the heat.  From a chemical prospective, soils generally need to heat to very high temperatures (above 900\u00b0C) and be wet to have a chance to even partially melt.  There is a concept called solidus and liquidus where by any chemical mixture has a wide range of temperatures and pressures whereby that mixture can exist as a partial melt consisting of liquids and solids (think crystals floating in a magma chamber!). The interior of the flows would definitely be hot enough to partially melt these soils, but because of the shielding properties of the lava flows, there just isn't enough heat.  Furthermore, rocks are super good insulators and have a very high heat retention (they take a long time to heat up and cool down).  So the soils quench the exterior of the flows without absorbing too much heat, and then the qunched exteriors insulate the flow.  I hope this helps, feel free to ask more questions!

            " I agree with everyone else, you wouldn't notice it. But let me try to explain what happens a bit better.  There are three main steps in detonating a simple hydrogen bomb:  * Initially there are two largish lumps of uranium that get quickly pushed together by a conventional explosive. This creates a small shock wave which starts propagating at roughly the speed of sound.  * Once there is a big lump of uranium a fission reaction can start. This creates a burst of gamma rays that propagate at the speed of light. (In a real bomb there are other components like an intense neutron source to help start the reaction with less uranium so the bomb can be smaller, but they don't matter for this.)  * So far we have an A-bomb. In a hydrogen bomb you also have a cylinder next to this that is filled with tritium and deuterium which is surrounded by material that will absorb the gamma rays and expand. (Because parts of this cylinder are further from the A-bomb, those parts of the material need to be able to absorb radiation better so the material can expand uniformly and compresses the hydrogen. **Edit:** That was an early use of Styrofoam -- but not what it was invented for.) When compressed enough, the hydrogen starts to fuse producing even more radiation.  This third step happens very quickly. The radiation from the A-bomb detonates the H-bomb before the shock wave from the initial conventional explosive can blow it apart.  In short, if you're close to an A-bomb the radiation will move through you at the speed of light and blow you apart before you could possibly notice. If you're further away the radiation gets absorbed by the atmosphere and most of the damage is caused by a conventional ~~sock~~ shock wave, and while you might be able to see the flash in time to know that the shock wave is coming it's still too fast to feel (nerve signals propagate at 1-120m/s, but the shock wave will be moving at closer to 340m/s). Even further away it's the heat and fallout that kills you so you have time to notice.",

            " The easy answer is no. If you mean combustion (or burning) of the bread, then there would be less calories because once combustion occurs (even partial) the byproducts are either indigestible or barely so.   If you mean dark toast, the kind you might get at 6 on the toaster, it has the same calories. The Maillard reaction is what drives browning and it is a complex process where proteins denature and bind to other proteins as well as carbohydrates and so forth created an amalgam of mixed molecules. Essentially this is what leads to that caramel/nuttiness you get when things are browned. However, this conformational change and denaturation does not decrease the calories because the overall building blocks are the same and still digestible.  However, if let\u2019s say a byproduct of a Maillard reaction is an indigestible molecule that was previously digestible, you could argue that it is now lower in caloric value because it is no longer bioavailable energy.   Side note, a lot of people are talking about measuring calories by using a bomb calorimeter aka burning the item. This is no longer the method used for finding caloric value of food. Instead they find the net average of Atwater bioavailable nutrients and then use standardized values (e.g. 4 Kcal/g for Carbohydrates) to calculate the assumed caloric value. Again, this is obviously dependent on bioavailable sources of energy, not overall stored energy.  A perfect example of how a bomb calorimeter is not a feasible option, is Lettuce. Excluding the water (which is 95% of the material) lettuce is primarily fiber. Insoluble fiber in this case or in other words fiber we cannot breakdown (Cellulose). This material has no caloric value to us because it is not bioavailable (aside from small amounts created by gut fermentation thanks to helpful bacteria). So a piece of lettuce has a net caloric value of basically 0 in the Atwater system. In a bomb calorimeter however, it might have a much higher value because inside each of those cellulose walled cells is stored sugars, proteins, and so forth. Additionally, cellulose is essentially a starch made up of Beta-Glucose, however Beta-glucose is in a different conformation than Alpha-Glucose in starches we digest which means it is incompatible with our enzymes. However, combustion wise, cellulose and amylose (Alpha-glucose polysaccharide aka starch to most people) are equivalent in \u201cCalories\u201d in the context of a bomb calorimeter.    Again, this is not the case in bioavailability. The only animals that can actually get the full caloric potential from plant material are foregut fermenters and hindgut fermenters, aka Cows and Horses. This is why they need multiple stomachs or a large cecum, in order to host helpful microorganisms to breakdown cellulose. Even Termites are not able to digest cellulose, but usually carry symbiotic organisms that can.   https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-food-manufacturers/  Addl. Note: /u/chuggsipas pointed out the fact that to be totally accurate about this discussion we have to really highlight that a Calorie at its base definition is the amount of energy required in order to raise one gram of water, by one degree Celsius. It\u2019s important to distinguish this because while I do mention that a bomb calorimeter is not used for nutritional labeling values, it is the correct way to calculate calories in its true context. Another thing chugg brought up, and I absolutely agree with, is the fact that nutritional calories are a terrible measure of how our body uses energy. We do not just ingest and combust whatever is bioavailable, there are a multitude of processes that are dedicated to metabolism, storage, availability, etc that are not taken into account by flat caloric values. In fact evidence builds every year that quality of foods and caloric sources are more important than the overall calorie value.

            " I think the main problem you're coming up against is that you're using an inappropriate set of relationships to think about the evolution of nervous systems. 'Invertebrate' isn't terribly meaningful, though 'vertebrate' is okay but a touch arbitrary.  &#x200B;  An example to explain - we are vertebrates but at a cellular level our nervous systems are more similar to echinoderms like starfish than they are to insects because we are more closely related to echinoderms than we are to insects. Both echinoderms and insects would be classed as 'invertebrates' though insects have clearly-defined brains while starfish don't. There's an interesting question here - did echinoderms lose their brains or did brains evolve twice, once in vertebrates and once in insects? I'm not sure of the answer to that but I suspect that some people have a fairly solid idea based on genetic and protein sequence evidence.  &#x200B;  I suspect that as a culture we get a bit too hung up on the brain as a concept and this can blind us to the underlying systems and their evolution. As far as I know a brain is a way to put the bulk of your nervous system in one place so that it is closer to your quick-acting sensory systems and can be more easily defended. It's easy to imagine that kind of strategy evolving several times given that all nervous systems we know about seem to share a common origin (though there is a group of scientists in Florida who will disagree and present the comb jelly as their case, but that's a different discussion).  &#x200B;  It's my understanding that our modern nervous system, where cells can quickly exchange molecules with other cells at a distance, evolved from an earlier paracrine system where cells could only exchange molecules with their neighbours. Sponges still are able to move around and react to their environment using a paracrine system and they use quite a few of the same molecules and proteins to do this despite not having a single nerve to their taxon. Paracrine systems probably evolved from even earlier systems to dispose of excess ions like calcium building up within a cell, a bit like what our kidneys do.   &#x200B;  So while there may be very different structural differences between our brains and the brains of other animals, the underlying systems are remarkably similar because those were laid down before the big divergences into different animal phyla."

            " This is actually a really interesting story. At the time it wasn't known what was causing Spanish flu and the treatments were mainly targeted towards the secondary bacterial infections. Influenza wasn't isolated until 1933 and it was suspected that this caused Spanish flu. It was confirmed that it was an H1N1 strain by testing antibodies from people that had survived the Spanish flu pandemic, however this didn't give us the complete genome of Spanish flu. By using frozen tissue samples preserved mainly from soldiers that had died during the pandemic, a guy called Dr. Jeffrey Taubenberger was able to piece together fragments of the viral genome like a puzzle and he got partially sequenced the genome before he ran out of samples and couldn't complete any more of the genome. This was put on the back burner until Dr. Johan Hultin came in. He had the idea of excavating mass graves from the Spanish flu pandemic in the permafrost of Alaska. The idea was that the tissues would have been well preserved since they would have been frozen since the people were buried, however he had tried this previously and was unsuccessful in obtaining the virus RNA. Luckily, on this occasion, they excavated the remains of an obese woman they named Lucy. They found that the fat around her lungs had left them remarkably well-preserved and they were able to obtain (very very tiny) fragments of RNA and use this to complete the puzzle. This was then reverse engineered to produce Spanish flu in the lab and was finally completed in 2006."

Water is actually a poor conductor of electricity.  It is the minerals and metals that are dissolved in it that allow current to flow through it more readily.  There is also a certain amount of resistance that must be taken into consideration with the passage of any given current.  That resistance will cause a certain amount of heat to be released that will increase the  temperature of the water.

As /u/Q-ArtsMedia mentioned, water is a poor conductor of electricity, unless it has high concentrations of dissolved ions or impurities. This means pure water has high \"Resistance\" to electrical current. Essentially, you'll have to apply a really high voltage across a gap of pure water in order to achieve \"breakdown\", which is when a current starts to flow (in this case due to the ionization of water particles).   *** As current flows through a material, energy is dissipated within the material according to Joule's Law (P ~ I^2 * R, or P ~ V/R^2), where P stands for power or the rate of heat dissipation. The heat generated through joule heating, as a result of sustained current, would go towards preventing the water from freezing.  *** Disclaimer, I'm a canadian engineering uni student, so am super high right now. I'm not 100% sure that Joule heating applies to a medium like water conducting electricity, since the electron source and propagation is a little different than in a conducting material. In any case, passing energy through a material in the form of current can really only prevent freezing from a thermodynamic perspective, as energy is will accumulate to some degree in the system as energy transfer is never 100% efficient.",

            " Another clue is in mistakes in manuscripts.  Many ancient manuscripts were dictated, and so by looking at which words and letters get mistaken for others, we can understand how words were pronounced.",
            " Many different methods, depending on what information is available. Like much in ancient history it's a matter of trying to piece together evidence and identify constraints on what must've been the case, until it narrows down to a specific guess. Somewhat similar in some ways to dating: you figure out that this person must've died before event X but after event Y; then you figure out that event X must've happened during a different person's lifetime, and eventually you get (if enough evidence is available) some good guesses.  A few examples:  * As jimktrains notes, inferring what words probably rhymed is one way of putting constraints on pronunciation, since it gives us information about likely phonemic splits and mergers (i.e. that phonemes now distinct used to be more similar, or that phonemes now unified used to be distinct). In addition to poetry, sometimes we have more explicit sources, such as rime dictionaries for Chinese.  * Transliterations. By looking at what Latin did with Greek loanwords, what Greek did with Latin loanwords, etc., we get some idea of what sounds were considered close to equivalent at the time. This doesn't in itself tell us how *either* language was pronounced, but it puts some constraints that lets us use information we already know about Latin phonology when reconstructing Greek phonology, and vice versa.  * Spelling mistakes. This data has to be used carefully, but a change in frequency of spelling mistakes can sometimes be used to date phonemic mergers, because people tend to more often mix up letters that have lost distinct pronunciation. For example, in modern Greek, <\u03b7, \u03b9, \u03b5\u03b9, \u03c5, \u03bf\u03b9> are all pronounced the same (roughly like English 'ee'), whereas at some point in ancient Greek they produced five distinct phonemes. By looking at when manuscripts start to mix up subsets of these, we can date some of the mergers, e.g. we have a guess that \u03b9 and \u03b5\u03b9 merged very early, while \u03b7 and \u03b9 merged later.  * Looking at simplifications or colloquial pronunciations. This usually requires some other information to come up with reasonable guesses, but in many cases looking at common simplifications (e.g. how in English one might say *goin'* for *going*) can let us guess something about what phonemes must've been involved.",

            " Multiple ways:  A. Typically, via comparative linguistics:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_linguistics (I know Wikipedia is frowned upon but it's a good write-up here)  Basically (linguists, I'm grossly simplifying here):  1. Identify multiple languages that are thought to be related (e.g. French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, English, Dutch, ...)  2. Compile word lists for each of those languages, so you can see how a certain word is represented in each of these languages.  3. If there is a genetic relationship between certain languages, for a particular word, certain features will be present across these languages. E.g. there's almost always an \"n\" in Romance and Germanic reflexes of \"one\". Words with the same ancestry (like German *hund*, English *hound*) are called cognates.  4. At some point you will be able to reconstruct, using cognates, the proto-language, like Proto-Germanic. *This is where we have a good-ish idea of how ancient languages might have sounded like. But it only works for languages that have diverged significantly - so, not useful for 18th century British and American Englishes.*  5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to reconstruct ancestors of proto-languages. At some point you can't go further with the evidence you have, and you end up with something like Proto-Indo-European.  B. Deciphered texts often provide clues. E.g. Egyptian hieroglyphs don't carry a lot of information about the actual sound values of their signs, and do not mark for vowels. But we have letters in Akkadian that were addressed to Egyptian kings, and we know roughly the sound values of Akkadian (via reconstruction), so we can infer the sounds of some pharaohs via the the Akkadian versions of their names (e.g. Nimmuaria for Amenhotep III, Nebmaatre). Similarly, Akkadian was deciphered through Old Persian.  C. Educated guesses: Some languages are deciphered and their sounds reconstructed by identifying the sounds of a small set of symbols, and then applying these known sounds to other texts, deciphering them, and then repeating the process. That's how Champollion approached Egyptian (identifying the glyphs that spelled Ptolemy and Cleopatra), and Michael Ventris Linear B (identifying symbols that spelled out the names of various Greek cities). I'll quote Wikipedia about Ventris (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B#Michael_Ventris.27_identification_as_Greek - emphases mine):  > Based on Kober's work, and **after making some assumptions**, Ventris was able to deduce the pronunciation of the syllables. Some Linear B tablets had been discovered on the Greek mainland, and there was reason to believe that some of the chains of symbols he had encountered on the Cretan tablets were names. Noting that certain names appeared only in the Cretan texts, he **made the guess** that those names applied to cities on the island. This proved to be correct. Armed with the symbols he could decipher from this, Ventris soon unlocked much text and determined that the underlying language of Linear B was in fact Greek, in direct contradiction to the general scientific views of the times, and to Ventris' own hunch that it would turn out to be Etruscan.  (Edited - my original example was of Bedrich Hrozny and Hittite, but Ventris' is a much better example)  D. Spelling mistakes, but that possible only if you have a good idea of how a writing system works.",

    "\n\nHuman: how does fat and protein digestion works? difference between lean and fatty protein and the effect on digestion time?  Hello altogether,  unfortunately I have many different questions about all things fat and protein digestion, specifically regarding animal products with different fat content.  I want to understand the science and the chemistry behind the whole topic and also educate myself even further because it seems like I know nothing.  I tried to do some \u201eresearch\u201c and found several different claims, opinions and explanations.  Before I get into the questions, I want to present the claims from the two different \u201ecamps\u201c because obviously there are more schools of thought?!  **Team fatty meat/protein:**  *The more fat that is in the protein the more delayed is digestion and therefore it sits in the small intestine longer and the required enzymes have more time to do their work and help digest the protein and the fat more efficiently, fully and easier! If the protein is leaner it goes to the digestive tract much faster, probably undigested and not fully absorbed by the small intestine.*  *Muscle meats like chicken breast or lean steak can aggravate constipation and therefore its beneficial to replace them with gelatinous meats instead and cuts with more soft tissue like chicken thighs, fatty meats etc. Humans can only use meat fibers properly when they come with fat, collagen and other substances.*  *Dark meat like chicken thighs or fatty cuts of meat contain more nutrients like zinc, iron and more vitamins like b12 additional folate, pantothenic acid, selenium, phosphorous, and vitamins K and A which aids in digestion.*  **Team lean meat/protein:**  *Meats with higher fat content take longer to digest. Also, foods with the least amount of fat, least amount connective tissues, and shorter muscle fibers are easier to digest. It means that fish is the easiest meat to digest, then poultry, pork and lastly beef*  *it also means that if the piece of chicken or turkey you are eating has more fat or long muscle fibers (thighs or drumsticks) than a LEAN piece of steak or a LEAN cut of pork, then that piece of chicken will be harder to digest!*  *A piece of boneless skinless chicken breast is easier to digest than a chicken thigh. Lean ground beef (93/7) is easier to digest than fattier ground beef (80/20) and a lean filet is easier to digest than a ribeye or beef brisket, chick etc.*  Ok, so far so good and I\u2019m confused.  What I found is a study about myoglobin and it seems like that dark meat or cuts of poultry and beef with more myoglobin and more connective tissue are \u201eharder\u201c to digest than white meat or poultry/beef with less myoglobin!?  **My questions are:**  What sits longer in the stomach, how long and why?  What sits longer in the small intestine, how long and why?  What kind of poultry/meat moves faster through the digestive tract, especially through the small intestine?  Which cuts require more effort, more enzymes, more stomach acid?  Which cuts are more taxing on the liver?  Is it easier and quicker for the small intestine to absorb nutrients from lean or fatty protein and why?  which factor determines whether a piece of animal protein/fat is light or heavy, fast or slow digesting when looking at the fat/food in isolation. Is it the fat content, connective tissue, a combination?  Is a fatty ribeye or hamburger patty (70/30 or 80/20) easier to digest than a lean filet steak? Or a fatty chicken thigh easier than a chicken breast? Pretend that all meats/beef/poultry are cooked to a moist internal temperature, not overcooked, tough or dry  Are low fat dairy products easier and quicker to digest than full fat dairy products?  At the end of the day I want to know which cuts of poultry/meat/beef/fish are easier to digest for the stomach and small intestine and which cuts are moving faster through the digestive tract. Also from which cuts the small intestine can easier absorb nutrients?  Im looking for a evidence based scientific answers in plain English that I can understand what\u2019s going on and why. I don\u2019t need study\u2019s, although it would be nice, but everything backed up with science based explanations and evidence not opinions or preferences like almost everything on YouTube, food blogs etc. I\u2019m looking for people who study this stuff or work in this field and know what they talking about.  Im very thankful for every explanation, help and for everyone who reads this.  I appreciate every Tipp where and how I can educate myself because I don\u2019t want to be lazy.  Thank you very much and have a great day\n\nAssistant:": {

The food must move from the lumen of the gi tract across the walls of the cells lining the the small  intestine and thence into the bloodstream.  The cell walls are composed of lipid (fat), thus only fats can cross the cell wall unassisted. The fats that you eat are too big - both physically too big (must be crushed into smaller pieces) and chemically too big (must be broken down into it's component parts by the action of enzymes coming from the pancreas and/or stomach wall) to cross the cell wall in the form in which they are eaten.  The breakdown from big hunks to small hunks occurs in the stomach due to repeated gastric contractions squashing the food and mixing it with the various gi secretions of saliva, acid and some enzymes.  If the fat is not broken down sufficiently it can't be attacked by the enzymes because they are water soluble and can not fight their way through a big hunk of fat. This process requires time not required for non-fat foods so fats stay in the stomach longer than non-fats if eaten separately.  It eaten together, everything is slowed down in the stomach.  Once the fats are sufficiently broken down physically they pass into the small intestine where more enzymes finish the chemical breakdown into components small enough to pass through the lipid cell walls.  Unfortunately, at this point the fatty particles are floating in the aqueous secretions of the stomach and small intestine and can not reach the lipid cell wall.  To make matters worse there is also a layer of water bound to the lining of the small intestine which also blocks movement of the fat components.  This is where bile comes into the picture.  Molecules of bile are water soluble on one end and fat soluble on the other so they form into little tiny hollow balls with the fatty ends pointing into the center of the ball.  As they form, the fatty food components are trapped inside the ball.  The water soluble ends are pointing out from the ball so the entire ball is now water soluble.  These balls (micelles) move through all the water and water layers and dump the fatty components directly on the cell walls where they can now pass through the wall into the cell.  To pass from inside the cell out the back side into the blood the fatty components must form another hollow ball with the fatty material inside and proteins outside which allows the fatty material to move around in the blood once it is absorbed.  Last but not least the fatty material moves from the small intestinal cells into the lymph not directly into the bloodstream where it must end up to be used for fuel.  Thus it travels through the lymph system until it reaches the thoracic duct where it is dumped into the bloodstream.  Obviously, fat digestion is a complex time- consuming process with many steps all of which must happen in the correct order.  Malabsorption of fat is quite common and causes smelly diarrhea.  Proteins are water soluble and special carriers exist in the walls of cells allowing amino acids to be transported into and out of the cells so the process of protein digestion and absorption is simple and rapid.  Eat the protein, proteases secreted by the mouth, stomach and pancreas begin to break down the proteins into constituent amino acids.  These move directly into the small intestine where they bind to the carriers on the cell walls and viola, absorption.  Malabsorption of proteins is rare and usually involves a congenitally missing carrier.  Complete digestion and absorption of a high fat meal may take several hours longer than that of low fat meal.",

            " So I do not know anything about digestion time but lean vs fatty protein is term for what is the fat to protein ratio in the meat, leaner meat has less fat. Neither is inherently healthier because you do need fat just some people get too much fat.  When you eat food it's broken down into its base components as you chew and in your stomach. Then as these pieces go through the small and large intestine your body pulls out nutrients until its sent to the colon. Alot of blogs and other people believe in super foods and there's perfect combinations but really you just need to make sure you eat enough variety to get all the nutrients you need.

            " Let's start with the first assumption:  It takes mechanical work somehow to absorb nutrients in food AND this mechanical work depends on the type of food.  A lot of your questions basically circle back to that.  Simplifying a little: You do have some mechanical work on your food to move it along from your lips to your anus this mechanical work is only influenced by the water content of your food and how well hydrated you are.  The primary mechanical work on food is done by your teeth. They break down a lot of the bigger bites and make them small enough to fit down your throat.  Almost every thing else is chemical in nature and the food gets treated the same mechanically from there.  In your stomach there are some very complex chemical reactions to further break down the food but it breaks it down chemically, yes it takes energy but the difference is fairly minimal as the primary component is to make it acidic enough to break down the food.  Other chemicals are added as it oozes from your stomach into your small intestine and those chemicals finish making the molecules small enough they pass through the wall into your bloodstream.  Your large intestine keeps leeching nutrients out of the ooze and your colon takes the water.  Bacteria will also eat some of the food for you and exude the nutrients you need.  Ironically for your question the cellulose in some plant matters here will cause extra work but not proteins.  Now there are medical conditions, including old age that will cause reactions with certain foods and create extra methane etc... causing gas or even indigestion around this point if the molecules can't be broken down properly but those are special conditions and your question was general.  You'll notice at no point is the nature of the food discussed.  That's because your digestive system doesn't care.  Unless you have diarrheas or constipation or even gas the food goes through you at the same speed.  Some more or less nutrients will come out undigested but that's it.  &#x200B;  Now you'll hear the arguments about being more tired or having less energy or feeling bloated etc... from either sides of this argument.  This comes AFTER the digestive system (Technically bloated is the gas but the point stands) when sugar enters your blood stream and you start feeling sleepy and/or your stomach is full enough it needs to cool down (Fun story your stomach operates better slightly below body tmeperature) so we've evolved the post food nap to help digestion in general.  &#x200B;  tl;DR: They are both wrong, the digestive tract doesn't really care what food comes in as long as it's food.",

            " Quick answer: If it has to be meat option then flakey fish is likely your best bet, but given everything you asked about tofu fits what you're looking for much better than any meat source. All meat cuts will have some effect on the average persons liver and other bodily systems for several reasons, but tofu is beneficial for liver health and does not cause latent effects that meat does. Tofu is also the best option in terms of digestion, protein content, and motility. The only thing that meat offers that tofu doesn't is B12. Animals don't actually synthesize B12 but it exists in dirt and animals intake it while grazing. However, soil nowadays is so depleted of B12 that the animals and therefore meat doesn't actually have significant amounts of B12 OR the cows receive vitamin injections. Other foods are fortifies with B12 to compensate and you really only need a small amount of B12 every few years as it is stored for a very long time, so I wouldn't worry much about B12. People who  eat any meat at all you're getting enough last you 3-4 years per serving.  It seems like what you're asking about is mainly about the bioavailability of protein (A protein is considered high bioavailable if it is easy to digest, absorb and make into other proteins) and motility (how quickly food moves through your digestive tract), but any reputable dietician will tell you that bioavailability does not actually affect the impact on your body.  Protein bioavailability is not significant in terms of the amount of protein you consume or how \"high quality\" the source of protein is. Bioavailability is important for things like iron but not protein.  To answer this question: \"At the end of the day I want to know which cuts of poultry/meat/beef/fish are easier to digest for the stomach and small intestine and which cuts are moving faster through the digestive tract. Also from which cuts the small intestine can easier absorb nutrients?\"  This is a very difficult question to answer because it is different per body. How easily & quickly ones body can digest and move along food is mainly determined by the bacterial profile that lives in your gut. Acids and bacteria are what is responsible for breaking down food but the bacteria colonizing your body is very different by person (and ethnicity) and will have quite a large effect on how efficiently your body breaks specific foods down. How quickly food moves is called motility and also varies by person greatly based on physical factors but also environment and what other things you consume.  It is very difficult to answer questions about someones motility with little info about their diet because things like caffeine, alcohol, and how efficiently your nerves work has a very large impact on this. It is also difficult to answer questions on this because bacterial profile as well as genetic difference vary greatly across ethnicities (and is why most white / Northern European descendant people can digest lactose but no other ethnicities widely can).   A lot of dietetic studies take place in the UK and US and were comprised of mainly white people with north European ancestry, giving them a specific genetic profile that greatly impacts digestion and motility but does not represent people outside that ethnicity well. A lot of these studies are the basis for now accepted information such as the idea that white flakey fish is the most easily digested meat, though that was studies with people of a northern-europeans genetic profile which contains several mutations affecting digestion that other ethnicities do not have.  \"Ok, so far so good and I\u2019m confused.\" You are probably getting confused by some of the information your finding because of the situation I described above, with different ethnicities having very different ability to digest food sources but the same principles being applied to all. Also scientists once overestimated the statistical significance of bioavailability but the general consensus now is that bioavailability of protein sources really doesn't have an impact.",
            " Let's start with the first assumption:  It takes mechanical work somehow to absorb nutrients in food AND this mechanical work depends on the type of food.  A lot of your questions basically circle back to that.  Simplifying a little: You do have some mechanical work on your food to move it along from your lips to your anus this mechanical work is only influenced by the water content of your food and how well hydrated you are.  The primary mechanical work on food is done by your teeth. They break down a lot of the bigger bites and make them small enough to fit down your throat.  Almost every thing else is chemical in nature and the food gets treated the same mechanically from there.  In your stomach there are some very complex chemical reactions to further break down the food but it breaks it down chemically, yes it takes energy but the difference is fairly minimal as the primary component is to make it acidic enough to break down the food.  Other chemicals are added as it oozes from your stomach into your small intestine and those chemicals finish making the molecules small enough they pass through the wall into your bloodstream.  Your large intestine keeps leeching nutrients out of the ooze and your colon takes the water.  Bacteria will also eat some of the food for you and exude the nutrients you need.  Ironically for your question the cellulose in some plant matters here will cause extra work but not proteins.  Now there are medical conditions, including old age that will cause reactions with certain foods and create extra methane etc... causing gas or even indigestion around this point if the molecules can't be broken down properly but those are special conditions and your question was general.  You'll notice at no point is the nature of the food discussed.  That's because your digestive system doesn't care.  Unless you have diarrheas or constipation or even gas the food goes through you at the same speed.  Some more or less nutrients will come out undigested but that's it.  &#x200B;  Now you'll hear the arguments about being more tired or having less energy or feeling bloated etc... from either sides of this argument.  This comes AFTER the digestive system (Technically bloated is the gas but the point stands) when sugar enters your blood stream and you start feeling sleepy and/or your stomach is full enough it needs to cool down (Fun story your stomach operates better slightly below body tmeperature) so we've evolved the post food nap to help digestion in general.  &#x200B;  tl;DR: They are both wrong, the digestive tract doesn't really care what food comes in as long as it's food.",

            " Quick answer: If it has to be meat option then flakey fish is likely your best bet, but given everything you asked about tofu fits what you're looking for much better than any meat source. All meat cuts will have some effect on the average persons liver and other bodily systems for several reasons, but tofu is beneficial for liver health and does not cause latent effects that meat does. Tofu is also the best option in terms of digestion, protein content, and motility. The only thing that meat offers that tofu doesn't is B12. Animals don't actually synthesize B12 but it exists in dirt and animals intake it while grazing. However, soil nowadays is so depleted of B12 that the animals and therefore meat doesn't actually have significant amounts of B12 OR the cows receive vitamin injections. Other foods are fortifies with B12 to compensate and you really only need a small amount of B12 every few years as it is stored for a very long time, so I wouldn't worry much about B12. People who  eat any meat at all you're getting enough last you 3-4 years per serving.  It seems like what you're asking about is mainly about the bioavailability of protein (A protein is considered high bioavailable if it is easy to digest, absorb and make into other proteins) and motility (how quickly food moves through your digestive tract), but any reputable dietician will tell you that bioavailability does not actually affect the impact on your body.  Protein bioavailability is not significant in terms of the amount of protein you consume or how \"high quality\" the source of protein is. Bioavailability is important for things like iron but not protein.

        "sft_target": " GI physiologist here: absorption of food stuffs depends entirely on chemical composition of the food.  The food must move from the lumen of the gi tract across the walls of the cells lining the the small  intestine and thence into the bloodstream.  The cell walls are composed of lipid (fat), thus only fats can cross the cell wall unassisted. The fats that you eat are too big - both physically too big (must be crushed into smaller pieces) and chemically too big (must be broken down into it's component parts by the action of enzymes coming from the pancreas and/or stomach wall) to cross the cell wall in the form in which they are eaten.  The breakdown from big hunks to small hunks occurs in the stomach due to repeated gastric contractions squashing the food and mixing it with the various gi secretions of saliva, acid and some enzymes.  If the fat is not broken down sufficiently it can't be attacked by the enzymes because they are water soluble and can not fight their way through a big hunk of fat. This process requires time not required for non-fat foods so fats stay in the stomach longer than non-fats if eaten separately.  It eaten together, everything is slowed down in the stomach.  Once the fats are sufficiently broken down physically they pass into the small intestine where more enzymes finish the chemical breakdown into components small enough to pass through the lipid cell walls.  Unfortunately, at this point the fatty particles are floating in the aqueous secretions of the stomach and small intestine and can not reach the lipid cell wall.  To make matters worse there is also a layer of water bound to the lining of the small intestine which also blocks movement of the fat components.  This is where bile comes into the picture.  Molecules of bile are water soluble on one end and fat soluble on the other so they form into little tiny hollow balls with the fatty ends pointing into the center of the ball.  As they form, the fatty food components are trapped inside the ball.  The water soluble ends are pointing out from the ball so the entire ball is now water soluble.  These balls (micelles) move through all the water and water layers and dump the fatty components directly on the cell walls where they can now pass through the wall into the cell.  To pass from inside the cell out the back side into the blood the fatty components must form another hollow ball with the fatty material inside and proteins outside which allows the fatty material to move around in the blood once it is absorbed.  Last but not least the fatty material moves from the small intestinal cells into the lymph not directly into the bloodstream where it must end up to be used for fuel.  Thus it travels through the lymph system until it reaches the thoracic duct where it is dumped into the bloodstream.  Obviously, fat digestion is a complex time- consuming process with many steps all of which must happen in the correct order.  Malabsorption of fat is quite common and causes smelly diarrhea.  Proteins are water soluble and special carriers exist in the walls of cells allowing amino acids to be transported into and out of the cells so the process of protein digestion and absorption is simple and rapid.  Eat the protein, proteases secreted by the mouth, stomach and pancreas begin to break down the proteins into constituent amino acids.  These move directly into the small intestine where they bind to the carriers on the cell walls and viola, absorption.  Malabsorption of proteins is rare and usually involves a congenitally missing carrier.  Complete digestion and absorption of a high fat meal may take several hours longer than that of low fat meal.",

If you drop a rock into a pond, it has a wave that propogates circularly outwards. So there is no place you can go on the water surface to \"fit inbetween\" the wave.

            " It's definitely difficult to say.  As you noted, artificial respiration wouldn't be figured out until 10 years later, but that's not all the trouble. Nutritional sciences were only finally starting to take hold, there was less access to clean water, and PPE was still pretty basic. Then there's the obvious difference of population density and urbanization.  And that's before we factor in WWI, which was the biggest part of the problem: refugee communities, rationing of food and medicine, and the constant cycling of thousands of soldiers to and from the front on a regular basis on top of wounded people having to also fight the disease, not to mention the intentional bar on posting accurate numbers of infections. There was just a lot of things going on that made the Spanish flu, which is now called H1N1, pretty much a perfect storm.  Edit: a pair of typos",

    "\n\nHuman: Black Lives Matter **Black lives matter.** The moderation team at AskScience wants to express our outrage and sadness at the systemic racism and disproportionate violence experienced by the black community. This has gone on for too long, and it's time for lasting change.   When 1 out of every 1,000 black men and boys in the United States can expect to be killed by the police, police violence is a public health crisis. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. In 2019, 1,099 people were killed by police in the US; 24% of those were black, even though only 13% of the population is black.  When black Americans make up a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths, healthcare disparity is another public health crisis. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of COVID-19 deaths. In Louisiana, black people are 33% of the population but account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs, with 38% of black workers employed in these industries compared with 29% of white workers. They are less likely to have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in medical care.  These disparities, these crises, are not coincidental. They are the result of systemic racism, economic inequality, and oppression.   Change requires us to look inward, too. For over a decade, AskScience has been a forum where redditors can discuss scientific topics with scientists. Our panel includes hundreds of STEM professionals who volunteer their time, and we are proud to be an interface between scientists and non-scientists. We are fully committed to making science more accessible, and we hope it inspires people to consider careers in STEM.   However, we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of diversity. In the US, black workers comprise 11% of the US workforce, but hold just 7% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. Only 4% of medical doctors are black. Hispanic workers make up 16% of the US workforce, 6% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, and 4.4% of medical doctors. Women make up 47% of the US workforce but 41% of STEM professionals with professional or doctoral degrees. And while we know around 3.5% of the US workforce identifies as LGBTQ+, their representation in STEM fields is largely unknown.  These numbers become even more dismal in certain disciplines. For example, as of 2019, less than 4% of tenured or tenure-track geoscience positions are held by people of color, and fewer than 100 black women in the US have received PhDs in physics.  This lack of diversity is unacceptable and actively harmful, both to people who are not afforded opportunities they deserve and to the STEM community as a whole. We cannot truly say we have cultivated the best and brightest in our respective fields when we are missing the voices of talented, brilliant people who are held back by widespread racism, sexism, and homophobia.  It is up to us to confront these systemic injustices directly. We must all stand together against police violence, racism, and economic, social, and environmental inequality. STEM professional need to make sure underrepresented voices are heard, to listen, and to offer support. We must be the change.   -----  **Sources:**  - https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793 - https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/ - https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/rounds/racial-disparities-time-of-covid-19 - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK24693/ - https://www.joincampaignzero.org/research - https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/black-workers-coronavirus-covid-19 - https://www.npr.org/transcripts/867466515 - https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/diversity-in-the-stem-workforce-varies-widely-across-jobs/ - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0519-z - https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.3.20190529a/full/ - https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/09/11/even-progressive-academics-can-be-racist-ive-experienced-it-firsthand/ - http://www.bu.edu/articles/2017/lgbt-issues-stem-diversity/\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: [Harry Potter] I'm a student at a prestigious magic school, but I'm having some issues. Need advice. I just enrolled at a famous academy of magic, you probably know it. It has a great reputation, but it's a mad house. The place is completely insane. It should be closed down immediately or at least the administration should be fired and replaced.  Some friends snuck out after dark, but one of the other students snitched and they got detention. I thought they'd have to stay in class after school let out, but instead they sent them into a dark forest, in the middle of the night, to find someone who had killed a unicorn. That's crazy and dangerous.  Just walking around inside of school is a hazard, there are stairways that keep moving--some kid from math class already fell to his death and was crushed.  Right from the beginning I knew there would be trouble, they put a magic hat on your head to pick your dorm, but everyone has to wear it and they don't wash it. It smells, it's sweaty, and the last dozen kids now have lice. Three dorms have cool names, but I'm stuck in the dorm named after a muppet.  The janitor hates us and advocates torture, the groundskeeper is a nice guy, but totally inappropriate in his behavior. We were given flight lessons, but with no helmets or protective gear, and then the instructor left us alone and all hell broke loose.  There's no security at all, there are monsters and ghosts just wandering everywhere. There's a girl ghost that hangs out in the boys' bathroom, it's really perverted but they won't do anything about it.  Some students found out that someone was in the school trying to steal some magic rock and told the vice principal but she didn't care and just dismissed them, then they nearly got killed. The VP is still there, nobody cares. The principal is never around, he's always off doing something more important.  There are all these animals in school, kids are getting bird flu from the owls, the plague from the rats, and there's a group that hangs out in the tower licking toads. I was eating lunch the other day and a bunch of messenger owls flew in and started crapping all over the food. It's really disgusting.  My language teacher is just making stuff up, she's completely unqualified. I don't even think it's real Latin, just gibberish.  I went to watch a sporting event, some game I couldn't even follow, and kids were being injured so badly they had to be hospitalized. There's a guy in my dorm who's had a few concussions already, his handwriting is barely legible now and he can't remember things. The teachers don't care, they keep giving him good grades even though you can see his hands shake when he holds his wand.  There's a weird kid in the other dorm who's always getting into trouble, but they don't care. I heard he's from an abusive foster family and is forced to live in a closet, maybe that's why. They should really get him into a better home and find a therapist for him so he stops acting out.  The favoritism is really out of hand, all year long there's a competition for which dorm is going to get the most points and at the last minute the principal showed up, started handing out bogus points, and arbitrarily decided that his favorite dorm should win.  Finally, they have all these elves enslaved at the school. They tell us the elves want to be there, working long hours in bad conditions, but I can't believe that's true. The elves have been beaten down so much that they claim they love the school and don't want their freedom, it's pitiful.  I've been writing letters home to my parents, but they're convinced I'm exaggerating things and don't believe me. I want to report the school, but I've told that the ministry is quick to silence its critics, so I'm scared. There are spells to know if people are lying, but they keep locking up innocent people anyway; it's like a police state. I just want to go to a normal school, what can I do?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Dear Young Sir/Madame,  &#x200B;  I am writing in response to your letter received by Flume on the 19th of April in the year 2019.  &#x200B;  We take all complaints directed at Hogwarts very seriously, and the Ministry has begun an investigative procedure to establish the nature of these events.  Your concerns regarding the conduct of staff and the safety of students are very serious indeed, and will be treated as such.  We invite you at this time to submit any further evidence, and additionally will be in contact shortly to arrange for taking a statement from you personally if you are willing to make this complaint formally.  Legal representation will be provided, and we hope to ensure that Hogwarts and indeed all Wizarding schools are brought up to a suitable standard.  With regards however to your concerns regarding the House Elves, may I presume that you are in fact Muggleborn?  It is common enough for complaints to arise on this matter from students unaccustomed to the presence or existence of lesser races.  While your regard for your fellow man is to be praised, it is important to distinguish between other human beings and non-human entities.  As you join the wizarding world you will find yourself encountering many such creatures, many of which can at a first glance seem to be intelligent.  I assure that they are not in fact equal to a Wizard or Witch, and that guidance and care must be taken in their treatment as they can be dangerous when left to roam untamed, especially those that retain the capacity for magic themselves, and might easily harm Muggles.  I implore you to keep an open mind on this matter.  Let me finish by reassuring you that the use of House Elves for such labor as they are capable of is entirely legal and approved by the ministry.  &#x200B;  I hope this letter finds you well,  &#x200B;  Yours Sincerely,  Dolores Umbridge",
            " Wizarding medicine is very good at treating physical injuries, and magic is very useful for keeping sanitary conditions. You're worrying over nothing.  Well, except the other stuff. That's exactly as bad as you say. Wizards are functionally an aristocracy, are you surprised they're corrupt as hell?",
            " Ehh, you sound like a bit hypochondriac and are pretty ignorant in the power of healing magic.",
            " Probably not the smartest move.  You see all that dangerous magical shit? That's the stuff they trust the kids with. The rest of it is out there, even more dangerous, and real.   See that cloudy weather out there? You think that's fog?! Kid, that's soul sucking monsters *fucking.*  The world's a scary place, and you're better off training for it.",
            " Oh you muggleborns and your fantasies. So much you just don\u2019t understand.   >Some friends snuck out after dark, but one of the other students snitched and they got detention. I thought they'd have to stay in class after school let out, but instead they sent them into a dark forest, in the middle of the night, to find someone who had killed a unicorn. That's crazy and dangerous.  Someone? Who killed a unicorn? Preposterous. The grounds of Hogwarts are exceedingly secure. And no one in their right mind would kill a unicorn. The unicorn must have been injured in some kind of accident. And the forest is relatively safe with adult supervision. Parts of it are not, but they would never get that deep unless they had a deathwish.   >Just walking around inside of school is a hazard, there are stairways that keep moving--some kid from math class already fell to his death and was crushed.  This is just a prank one of your friends is playing on you. Sprained or twisted ankle? Maybe, but that\u2019s nothing a 5th year couldn\u2019t fix, let alone the school nurse. But that\u2019s about the worst that could happen from the stairways.   >Right from the beginning I knew there would be trouble, they put a magic hat on your head to pick your dorm, but everyone has to wear it and they don't wash it. It smells, it's sweaty, and the last dozen kids now have lice. Three dorms have cool names, but I'm stuck in the dorm named after a muppet.  Say it with me child, MAGIC. The hat is self cleaning. Whatever those students have, they didn\u2019t get it from the hat.   >The janitor hates us and advocates torture,   Filch is a little rough about the edges but you should learn to have compassion. It\u2019s not my place to speak except to say everyone struggles with their own burdens. And while I may agree that corporal punishment is rightfully left in the past, what he advocates is what many of us experienced, not torture.   >the groundskeeper is a nice guy, but totally inappropriate in his behavior.   Inappropriate how? You realize most of your pureblood classmates would describe you the same? So perhaps reconsider your bigotry.   >We were given flight lessons, but with no helmets or protective gear, and then the instructor left us alone and all hell broke loose.  Again, nothing a trip to the nurse wouldn\u2019t fix. Muggle children regularly scrape their knees at the playground. We can fix what you worry about far easier than your parents could mend your knees.   >There's no security at all, there are monsters and ghosts just wandering everywhere.   Just because you can\u2019t see something doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t exist. Hogwarts is the most secure building in all of Britain. Ghosts are harmless, and those \u201cmonsters\u201d may not be monsters at all but creatures worthy of respect.   >There's a girl ghost that hangs out in the boys' bathroom, it's really perverted but they won't do anything about it.  I know the ghost you\u2019re speaking of. She haunts one specific girl\u2019s bathroom. I understand it may take adjustment but there\u2019s absolutely nothing inappropriate about her.   >Some students found out that someone was in the school trying to steal some magic rock and told the vice principal but she didn't care and just dismissed them, then they nearly got killed. The VP is still there, nobody cares.   Because the idea was preposterous. And even had it not been, that person was incapable of retrieving that item. They were only in any way harmed because they disregarded the deputy head. And even then, their injuries were minor.   >The principal is never around, he's always off doing something more important.  The headmaster is the most powerful, most important wizard in all of the world. Were he to step down, the current deputy headmistress would be the next best choice for head, so having both of them there to educate you is a major boon.   >There are all these animals in school, kids are getting bird flu from the owls, the plague from the rats, and there's a group that hangs out in the tower licking toads. I was eating lunch the other day and a bunch of messenger owls flew in and started crapping all over the food. It's really disgusting.  Everything you\u2019ve said here is absolutely preposterous. Not a single mail owl would ever defecate where it was unsafe to, and there has never been a single case of one transmitting disease. The only one of these that might potentially be true is the toads, and, quite frankly, unless they\u2019re disturbing you in some manner, I see no reason to be concerned.   >My language teacher is just making stuff up, she's completely unqualified. I don't even think it's real Latin, just gibberish.  Ah, I get it you\u2019re one of those- what\u2019s the muggle word? ~~Goblins?~~ ~~Pixies?~~ trolls! That\u2019s it. You\u2019re a troll. Hogwarts doesn\u2019t even offer Latin. The only \u201clanguage\u201d offered is ancient runes.   >I went to watch a sporting event, some game I couldn't even follow, and kids were being injured so badly they had to be hospitalized. There's a guy in my dorm who's had a few concussions already, his handwriting is barely legible now and he can't remember things. The teachers don't care, they keep giving him good grades even though you can see his hands shake when he holds his wand.  They did not have to be \u201chospitalized\u201d. They got sent to the school nurse. And there aren\u2019t any quidditch injuries that aren\u2019t easily fixed up by magic.   >There's a weird kid in the other dorm who's always getting into trouble, but they don't care. I heard he's from an abusive foster family and is forced to live in a closet, maybe that's why. They should really get him into a better home and find a therapist for him so he stops acting out.  If you believe a classmate is being abused, please speak to your head of house. But also realize, you\u2019re not privy to all the details, and we will not violate your classmate\u2019s privacy, either to tell you he\u2019s lying or any other circumstances.   >The favoritism is really out of hand, all year long there's a competition for which dorm is going to get the most points and at the last minute the principal showed up, started handing out bogus points, and arbitrarily decided that his favorite dorm should win.  While it may appear that way to you, you\u2019re going to have to trust that the points are awarded on merit.   >Finally, they have all these elves enslaved at the school. They tell us the elves want to be there, working long hours in bad conditions, but I can't believe that's true. The elves have been beaten down so much that they claim they love the school and don't want their freedom, it's pitiful.  The house elves at Hogwarts have not been beaten. In fact, I just today fielded a complaint from one house elf there that she\u2019s not being punished enough. While your dedication to equal rights is commendable, you\u2019re going to need to learn that human culture is not the only culture, nor is it the inherently \u201cright\u201d culture. You need to learn to respect the differences not only of other people but other species.   >I've been writing letters home to my parents, but they're convinced I'm exaggerating things and don't believe me.   Clearly they\u2019re familiar with you.   >I want to report the school, but I've told that the ministry is quick to silence its critics, so I'm scared. There are spells to know if people are lying, but they keep locking up innocent people anyway; it's like a police state. I just want to go to a normal school, what can I do?  We do not silence critics, that\u2019s absurd. As you will learn, most spells are not perfect. For every curse, there\u2019s a counter curse. While truth detection spells can be useful, they can also be beaten. Not just by countermagic, but by memory charm.   If you wish to snap your own wand and return to your muggle life without magic, that is your choice.",

The Rebels I think are fine with most factions for whatever reason, but the Empire is \"You're either with us or against us.\", so it radicalizes most groups, and they end up default Rebels.

Before his return, the use of the name Voldemort is responded with in hushed tones and looking over one\u2019s shoulder and a large part of that is because there were a lot of wizards and creatures on Voldemort\u2019s side that never got caught, imprisoned, or executed; you never could be sure of who was listening.

Only the oldest remember him personally. Voldemort, however, was running around murdering people ten years ago. most wizards in the modern day would have lost at least an acquaintance to him.  People don't refuse to say names out of moral disgust, they do it out of trauma. Grindlewald was a historical figure. Voldemort wasn't.",

Before his return, the use of the name Voldemort is responded with in hushed tones and looking over one\u2019s shoulder and a large part of that is because there were a lot of wizards and creatures on Voldemort\u2019s side that never got caught, imprisoned, or executed; you never could be sure of who was listening. These very wizards and creatures are widely *known* to be lying in wait of their dark lords return, but not all of them are known."

    "\n\nHuman: [MCU] Hawkeye show canon So this question is more of a general meta question combined with a question about a specific character.  My question is are the Marvel Netflix shows canon to the MCU right now. I\u2019m asking specifically because in Hawkeye, Kingpin\u2019s feats of strength are inconsistent with his screen time in Daredevil. In Hawkeye, he ripped a door off it\u2019s hinges, punched Kate Bishop across a room, and walked off getting rammed by a car like it was nothing. In Daredevil, his greatest feat of strength was punching a hole in a brick pillar and even that hurt him. That\u2019s a huge difference.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Meta] Is there anything we can do about bad, general questions? I know this seems like a stretch or a bad topic, but please here me out.  I have been looking at ASS and there are some (probably 1 out of every 5) questions that are not so much \"Ask Social Science\" but \"Here's my opinion please substantiate it for me\").   [Why did the Anglo-Saxon culture take over the Earth?  * This question already has a very important assumption embedded in it (Anglo-Saxon culture is the dominant culture on Earth). The question doesn't provide any reasons on why they think so or where they might be coming from (Have they seen other parts of the world? What is Anglo-Saxon? How is Brazilian culture anything like Anglo-Saxon? Or Japanese? etc.)  Why do people from Non-Western cultures use extreme body language when grieving?  * This one was at least already pointed out. The question is culture-centric and has no basis to be asked, with no examples, and is phrased in a way where it's a US <> THEM (who are worse than I) way.  Why are soldiers right -wing?  *Again, a baseless claim that seeks justification.    It's frustrating to see. I'd like ASS to be just as strong as askscience but I don't enjoy seeing very culturally-centered questions  cluttering the front page when there are some actual interesting questions being asked.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Are introverts really looked down upon? If so, is there evolutionary psychology behind to it? My question was inspired from a post in /r/Philippines where OP said he was being given a hard time for being an introvert. I did notice this as well that introverts seem to be looked upon. I am generally quiet myself and not introvert per se but I do talk and engage with others when I want to or needed be. Others that I know, however, who are more introverted get criticised for avoiding the group in general. I think those people I mentioned are naturally socially anxious but that's another story.  Is there a reason why introverts are looked down upon by a group? I am speculating that it might be evolutionary that humans think we should all stick together, being social and all, in order to survive and those who do not participate are seen as not contributing to the group in any way.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Your question implies (or assumes a particular answer to) an empirical question. I don't know how to prove the negative with a citation, so I'll just link here to a google scholar search with some likely terms: I'm very open to being wrong about this, but I don't know of literature actually studying the question of whether introverts are the systematic target of prejudice or discrimination or negative stereotyping.   That said, and knowing I might be wrong, there's certainly a lot of assuming that \"introverts\" are a marginalized class of individuals. The word is in quotes because introversion is a dimensional personality trait, not a set of categories. I don't know if there is epidemiology-type research showing some kind of clustering of correlates or outcomes or something that would strengthen the case for the existence of a discrete group of people identified as \"introverts\" (there might be), so I continue to think in dimensional terms: there are some people very high on the introversion personality trait. There are also people medium-high, less high, etc.  But lots of writers of scholarly and quasi-scholarly literature insist that introverts are marginalized, in some cases apparently suggesting that the marginalization processes are similar to those studied in sexism and racism research.  My problems with this are threefold:  **1.** I don't know of any research demonstrating an overall bias against \"introverts\" (I know the public might perceive a discrete group of people even though science doesn't seem to, so this is still a real possibility; I just don't know of the research).  **2.** The somewhat defensive defenses of \"introverts\" I have seen/read/survived at conferences have all made the apparently solid observations that North Americans/Western Europeans have many socially positive prototypes, myths, figures of speech, etc. associated with the characteristics of extroversion, with implied denigration of those characteristic of introversion. These authors also point out (probably quite accurately) that there are many activities in our meta-society that are easier for extroverts than for introverts, such as those requiring public speaking, aggressive socializing, daily assertiveness, etc. While these points seem to make lots of sense, they ignore some things, like...  (a) ...the fact that our societies also have many positive things to say about introvert traits, with negative things to say about extroverts (\"Speak softly and carry a big stick,\" \"Still waters run deep,\" \"If you can't say anything nice...\" \"just flapping his gums,\" \"running her mouth,\" \"babbling brooks,\" \"Quiet people have the loudest minds,\" etc.) that imply the opposite of the persecuted-introvert hypothesis. Look at any list of \"quotes about introverts\" and see how many are critical of introvert-typical behavior. There are any number of literary or Hollywood heroes/heroines who are introverts (Introversion fits well with the \"quiet/demure\" part of traditional female gender roles, as well as with the \"strong, silent\" male gender role--go count the number of action heroes who appear to just love parties and chitchat) and these characters are often portrayed as patiently suffering the extrovert fools around them.   (b) ...logically, the existence of an easier pathway for success with some characteristics than others does not necessarily imply prejudice, much less active discrimination; physically stronger people pass firefighter exams more easily, but that doesn't mean the rest of us are a bunch of anti-weak-people bigots. People with high levels of psychopathy (and correspondingly low levels of empathy) have an easier time making loads of money as CEOs or corporate lawyers, but this doesn't mean everyone carries some anti-nice-person prejudice.  **3.** The \"takedowns\" of extroversion are all kind of holier-than-thou. Okay, maybe I'm the defensive one, now; I have never been described as an introvert, so that's a possibility. However, just read/listen to/watch a few of these, and I think you'll agree that the tone is often one of superiority; it's not just that introverts are a persecuted class of people who are just as good as anyone else; the injustice is so much worse because introverts are *better* than other people, and those other people don't recognize that fact! If the extroverts would just stop talking for a few minutes, or stay home and read a book or two, or leave the friggin' party early, maybe they could become smart, insightful, and truly independent, too! And finally recognize that the introverts in their lives have always been better at these things! Some of these pieces are much less like this than others, I realize; some are quite reasonable, and point out important ways in which we seem to have structured our world to prioritize certain interpersonal strategies over others, with bad consequences. It's telling that there is a micro-industry in celebrating introversion in the US right now. Actually, googling \"quotes about introverts\" and \"sayings about talking,\" etc. I'm becoming convinced that this isn't new; perhaps we've been bemoaning the unfair dominance of extrovert traits for centuries.  **4.** People have experiences. Those experiences are real. They cause suffering. They are compelling. We are behavioral scientists, and these facts do not mean that we instantly accept those people's accounts of the *causality* of those experiences. If the \"introverts\" of the world are convinced they are experiencing systematic oppression (trying to use a feminist definition of that term), this could be due to systematic bias and discriminatory behavior, or probably other things. For one thing, nearly *everyone* feels they are socially disconnected and disadvantaged; it's one of the most common human experiences to feel that you aren't really a full member of your community, that you aren't as respected or appreciated as you'd like, that your intimate relationships aren't as close or authentic as you wish they were, etc. Another possibility is that people with lots of introversion are more likely to have self-fulfilling prophecy effects, in which their discomfort in certain social situations leads to other people behaving in ways they perceive as threatening or marginalizing, and around and around. More possibilities will surely have been considered by smarter people than I. In any case, one common thread in the \"introverts unite\" treatises I've seen is a complete lack of any meaningful null hypothesis. Well, there are lots of them, and hey, science.  So before we start answering the question of where anti-introvert prejudice comes from, let's get some data: is it even a thing? Lots of armchair philosophers think it is, and lots of people who cherry-pick cultural tidbits seem to conclude that it is, but I suspect the reality is more mixed. American culture, at least (I'm American, and most of the pro-introvert content I've seen is also American), has always had a mix of celebrating and demonizing both extroversion-typical and introversion-typical behaviors (I didn't mention it above, but \"deranged loner\" is the media flip-side of \"strong, silent type\", so yeah, our world has some nasty things to say about introverts, too, sometimes). I suspect that any research out there (I'm assuming there is some... how could there not be?) finds something other than a simple anti-introvert prejudice construct if it asks reasonably balanced sets of questions. I don't think this will be structured much like racist, anti-gay, sexist, or even anti-political-leanings kinds of prejudice at all.  TL;DR: Hold your horses. Let's find out if anti-introvert discrimination is a thing before we start trying to explain it.  *Edit (24 hours later)*: IDK if I can trust reddit's vote count, but this one has zigzagged up and down between about 15 and 3. Heh. Only one actual comment, of course, but I assume some people are annoyed that I have questioned the Introvert Orthodoxy. So be it. If it can't stand scrutiny, then it's a a bad idea.",

            " I'm not an expert on this either, but I found this study conducted for the West Virginia Legislature's Joint Committee on Government and Finance which has a number of interesting, if not unexpected results. They suggest that, in one year, the potential direct cost savings just from obstetrical or delivery costs was about $981,000. Additional direct cost savings might come from prenatal care, which they estimate could range from a $2.50 to $7 cost savings for each dollar invested in the program. They also mention that, since average birth costs were used, they may not reflect the additional costs that would be incurred by women undergoing Caesarean sections or caring for babies of low birthweight; costs in these cases are exponentially higher than in normal births, so cost savings would be commensurately higher.   The authors also mention a good study by Hoffman (2006) who found that early teen births reduce the lifetime earnings of the resulting children by about $810 per year, or about $35,000 over the course of a lifetime.   It's important to note that the sample size for this study is VERY small. Their data examine dependent minors, and the number of eligible women was obtained from the PEIA (Public Employees Insurance Agency); it's unclear whether the numbers are for all minor dependents in the state or just minor dependents covered by the PEIA itself. They also assumed a participation rate of 20% (that is, 20% of eligible dependent minors actually took contraception). Either way, their assumption was a sample size of 2,625. So these numbers reflect a VERY small sample population compared to a larger geographical area or a higher participation rate, and are probably conservative even for this small sample size.   Whether these numbers are directly applicable to a larger population is a bit unclear; for example, as they point out, costs vary widely depending on the ease of the birth, and the age of the parent is directly correlated with this (for example, minors are more likely to have babies of low birthweight, with commensurately high costs as mentioned above). However, most likely they're at least in the ballpark. At the very base of all this is the fact that contraception coverage is extremely cheap for insurers (dollars per person), whereas covering the birth, prenatal and post-natal care of a child costs in the thousands of dollars. The economics on that end is fairly simple.",

            " I take it you're referring to the recent debate in the US. In that case, I highly recommend you read the source of the contraceptive mandate idea, a report from the Institutes of Medicine that attempted to outline what the best preventive practices for women are from both a health and cost-effectiveness standpoint. You can read the report online here.  In brief, you can see here that access to contraception is part of a broader package of women's health. The benefits are manifold - proper family planning allows women to better plan their careers and other major lifestyle decisions (economic benefit); put more space between their pregnancies, which has been shown to lead to better outcomes for children; and reduce the rate of unintended pregnancies: currently, ~49% of pregnancies in America are unintended, and I'm sure you can imagine the negative consequences of that figure, which is much higher than other developed countries.  I hope that gives you an idea to start with, but like I said reading the report is the best way to go. The relevant section starts on page 102.",

            " Less sick days for those whose diseases or conditions would be lessened by contraceptives, including those with \"off-label\" uses.  Fluke (the person criticized by Rush Limbaugh) discussed a friend with polycystic ovarian syndrome, or PCOS, who had multiple cysts in her ovaries, but was denied the coverage of birth control pills, even though her physician specifically noted she needed them to manage PCOS. This is a common, off-label use. Ironically, she could not afford the much higher price of the pills without coverage, and developed a massive cyst - and lost one of her ovaries. It's possible she may not be able to have a child at all, as a result.   I've had two ruptured ovarian cysts. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would unabashedly rank them as \"11\" (sorry, Nigel). You feel like your guts are tearing apart from within. Needless to say on both occasions I had to leave the workplace and was unable to return immediately, and I was one of the many lucky women who did not develop an infection or have a more serious cyst rupture.   I cannot imagine the pain and suffering of someone whose ovaries are constantly producing cysts - but I can confirm that she is unable to function at her best in her workplace. With key members of various work teams potentially unable to control their health problems in safe, effective ways, this could have a ripple effect in many workplaces."

            " Gallup--an organisation devoted to human potential that measures things that are hard to measure, such as excellence and how to create it--have some good stuff on education. They have a book about how to make good schools, and another about good teachers:  >Learn what great teachers do differently in Teach With Your Strengths. Discover fresh approaches to bring public schools back to life in Building Engaged Schools and learn what motivates great teachers and inspires students to tap into the considerable potential in America's classrooms.  https://www.gallup.com/education/227657/improve-k-12.aspx  Another approach is to focus on the business side, which TMBC handles well with their research on managers and performance acceleration.   Gallup also have have a great book called, 'Now, Discover Your Strengths,' which is about using a research and strengths based approach to designing and running a business. This would also apply to schools, and I hear from some teachers certain areas use Gallup's selection tool for hiring, which theoretically, should give rise to better hires.   In Australia, the government is also committing to hiring better teachers, and making it harder to becoming a teacher. This is wise,since I'm sure you'll remember from school some teachers just weren't suited to the job. That's a hiring problem. Easily fixed. Unsure if their solution will be effective, but the intention is sound. People shouldn't be able to do whatever they want to do. The research shows that's a bad idea. (1 in 10 people have the right talents to be a good manager, for example. The rest are either mediocre, or bad. The more experience I have, the more I realise bad and mediocre produce similar results, ultimately. They fuck up people's lives. Not because they're bad people, but because they aren't suited to the role of management, that research shows is the most important role in an organisation. Employees already feel this, but aren't always able to trace bad work experiences back to bad management. When you know the signs, though, it's obvious)    https://www.smh.com.au/politics/nsw/new-nsw-teachers-to-require-a-credit-average-superior-intelligence-20180902-p501ao.html  Jennifer Fox is also a pioneer in this field. If you check out her YouTube channel, she has some content about the 'affinities program' she designed, which was used to help students other schools didn't want (due to their poorly designed systems not being able to handle diversity) get great results and show those students can do well if you don't suck. She had some promising projects under development, but I'm not sure what happened to them. She also has a book called, 'Your child's strengths.'  Sugata Mitra, who did the famous TED Talks, also does cool stuff, but I'm not sure how applicable it is to public eduction in developed nations.   All of this can be summer up as the \"just throw good design and strengths-based approaches\" at it.",

Oh, this is easy. Under a gold standard, the price level is just the inverse of the price of gold. Thus, fluctuations in the supply and demand for gold drove fluctuations in consumer price inflation.  An increase in the supply of of gold, all else equal, drives down the relative price of gold, which leads to inflation in consumer prices.   An increase in the demand for gold, all else equal, drives up the relative price of gold and leads to deflation in consumer prices.

            " There's a lot of opinions but very little data going against. The vast majority of large-scale research into environmental influences fails to control for heredity, e.g. studies showing parents who read to kids often produce better developed and successful children (was it genes for language skills and emotional intimacy, or the action itself?).  Parents can have negative influences on children through abuse and privation, the literature on that is uncontroversial, however there is also a clear genetic component affecting outcomes in those cases.  However, if you read Harris's 1995 paper that sparked the style of thinking that likely produced the book you mention, she notes that a huge amount of environmental influences are simply unaccounted for. Consider birth order effects within families. Who's to say that we should expect all first-borns to have a similar familial environment due to their position? What if the first-born in one family ends up playing a similar social role in the family dynamic to that of a third-party in another family, they would have environmental effects shaping their development (hypothetically), but no statistical pattern would arise from unpredictable patterns like these, if the social roles of siblings vary enough between families. All it requires is that most siblings don't share similar roles in the family dynamic.  Also consider the unreasonable effectiveness of family therapy for treating various mental health issues. Studies into family therapy show improvements in various domains of mental health, however every study of specific mechanisms for these effects has failed to establish any replicable factors which would provide evidence for a pathway for family therapy's positive impact. It works, by all appearances, but we have no statistical evidence explaining why that would be the case, only theoretical and anecdotal. Alan Carr has a few papers on this issue specifically, and a few books generally on family therapy.  It's possible that there are environmental factors that are so noisy and dynamic that a pattern in the data is impossible under current paradigms (once-off paper survey research is prominent).

        "rejected_target": " There's a lot of opinions but very little data going against. The vast majority of large-scale research into environmental influences fails to control for heredity, e.g. studies showing parents who read to kids often produce better developed and successful children (was it genes for language skills and emotional intimacy, or the action itself?).  Parents can have negative influences on children through abuse and privation, the literature on that is uncontroversial, however there is also a clear genetic component affecting outcomes in those cases.  However, if you read Harris's 1995 paper that sparked the style of thinking that likely produced the book you mention, she notes that a huge amount of environmental influences are simply unaccounted for. Consider birth order effects within families. Who's to say that we should expect all first-borns to have a similar familial environment due to their position? What if the first-born in one family ends up playing a similar social role in the family dynamic to that of a third-party in another family, they would have environmental effects shaping their development (hypothetically), but no statistical pattern would arise from unpredictable patterns like these, if the social roles of siblings vary enough between families. All it requires is that most siblings don't share similar roles in the family dynamic.  Also consider the unreasonable effectiveness of family therapy for treating various mental health issues. Studies into family therapy show improvements in various domains of mental health, however every study of specific mechanisms for these effects has failed to establish any replicable factors which would provide evidence for a pathway for family therapy's positive impact. It works, by all appearances, but we have no statistical evidence explaining why that would be the case, only theoretical and anecdotal. Alan Carr has a few papers on this issue specifically, and a few books generally on family therapy.  It's possible that there are environmental factors that are so noisy and dynamic that a pattern in the data is impossible under current paradigms (once-off paper survey research is prominent). Big data and the advent of extensive personal data collection could change this (e.g. comparing Facebook usage statistics within and between families, for example). Or easier longtudinal research through extensive online surveying."

But can you also say that those people \"want\" to be malnourished and obese?

Information (knowledge of nutrition, how to cook with raw ingredients). Barriers to access (e.g., travel costs). Normative influences (what everyone else around you has been eating your whole life). Survival and poverty cultures (fatalism, short-term thinking, etc.).   The market is already distorted by agricultural subsidies. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy#United_States  It is not necessary to make a condescending argument that poor people are \"brainwashed\" or stupid to point out that one's immediate environment shapes normative standards.

Of course, we spend roughly twice as much as equivalent countries, so that is a problem in its own right. But, the real issue is that health care spending has been rising, and is projected to continue to rise, much faster than the rate of inflation \u2013 usually in the range of 7-8% per year.   The Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\") is designed to address that in several ways. First, by expanding insurance coverage, people will be more likely to get regular checkups, use birth control, and other preventative measures that should see cost savings in the long run. There is some debate as to whether preventative care is that much cheaper, but overall it should help rather than hurt.  Second, the ACA established the Independent Payment Advisory Board, whose mission is to analyze Medicare spending and find ways to reduce costs without sacrificing quality of care. A tall order, to be sure, but the goal is to eliminate redundancies and encourage the most efficient care. One way it will probably do this is by encouraging \"bundled\" spending, where physicians receive payment based on the overall care a patient is receiving rather than on a per-service basis.   The ACA will also cut about $200 billion in Medicare spending over 10 years, mostly from Medicare Advantage, a privately-run Medicare alternative.  Finally, keep in mind that \"reduce the deficit\" is not always the same as \"save money.\" There are tax increases in the ACA as well.

Many uninsured people also have no primary care physician and go to the ER for all medical problems, which is more expensive. As it is now, the cost of health insurance takes these cases into account - the way bad drivers make insurance rates higher for all drivers. If more people have access to preventative care, hospitals and insurers will have to absorb fewer of these unnecessarily expensive (and unpaid-for) treatments."

If more people have access to preventative care, hospitals and insurers will have to absorb fewer of these unnecessarily expensive (and unpaid-for) treatments."

    "\n\nHuman: Are there markers for revolution? When do people stop respecting the wealthy? How close are we in US/Europe? I was thinking today how income disparity is growing in the US, yet people still seem to idolize the wealthy (generally speaking).  Not everyone of course, but as a society, people still oggle over handbags and support Instagram influencers who get to travel the world because they're attractive. People still watch the Kardashians and consider people \"ballers\" if they drive lambos and spray champagne in the air.   Alongside this, the income disparity is growing, we have constant stories of corporate greed, and rich business people taking control of governments across the globe.  Is there a point at which the tables turn and society as a whole starts to dislike and punish this sort of behavior? Is there a point at which society has a whole stops being jealous of the wealthy, and instead starts to punish this sort of lifestyle? Is it already happening to some extent? Is it inevitable?  Thanks for any insight on this.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " There are probably a few contributing factors: how recent the event is, the death toll, degree of damage, media coverage of the event, notability of the target.  The Oklahoma City Bombing killed 168 people and injured 680 others. It caused an estimated $652 million dollars in damage. It occurred 6 years prior to 9/11, and targeted the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building, which, while it may have been a landmark for citizens of Oklahoma City, was largely unknown to citizens outside of that area. The remains of the building were demolished a month after the attacks.  9/11 killed 2,996, caused over 6,000 injuries, and an estimated $10 billion in damage. They targeted the twin towers of the World Trade Center, a major landmark that every tourist to New York City and even people who've never been there recognize -- look at any given movie set in NYC prior to 2001. There's almost certainly a shot of the two towers at some point in the film. They also targeted the Pentagon, 229 miles away, which influences the localized effect of the attacks.  The 7/7 London bombings killed 52 people and injured about 700. The attacks took place on the London Underground and on a bus in Tavistock Square in 2005.  Pearl Harbor was a military attack in 1941, so it has some inherent qualities that separate it from the other attacks mentioned here, but it's an event with a lot of historical significance, and it's much older than the others, so I think it's worth mentioning. 2,403 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded.  So, we can examine some differences between these attacks that might contribute to the historical memorability or significance of the attacks.  First, death toll. Of our four examples, Pearl Harbor is the only attack that comes close to 9/11's casualty count. The composition of the population of victims may be a contributing factor as well. 316 foreign nationals from 84 countries were killed in 9/11; they account for almost 10% of those killed. By contrast, the other attacks mentioned predominantly killed citizens of the country in which the attack happened. This may influence the international impact of the attack. Interestingly, more British citizens were killed in the 9/11 attacks than during the 7/7 bombings, despite not occurring on British soil.  Second, media coverage. This study found that exposure to the 9/11 attacks was a significant factor in the amount of emotional distress people reported afterwards, more than degree of loss experienced. Consider the types of media coverage we saw during 9/11 - eyewitness video of the planes actually striking the buildings in a fiery explosion, eyewitness video of people leaping to their deaths from the windows, video of people running from the rolling wall cloud of smoke and debris as the towers fall. By contrast, we have little video of the OKC bombing that occurs during the attacks. There may be some unreleased security camera footage that show the bombing as it happens, but most of our footage shows only the aftermath -- the shredded hulk of the Murrah building.  Third, economic impact. This study examined the macroeconomic impact of 9/11 (and even compares it to other terrorist attacks, including OKC). The 9/11 attacks strongly correlate with a *national* decrease in US GDP growth and an increase in unemployment, at least in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. With other terrorist attacks, we tend to see more localized effects -- OKC bombing, for example, might have affected the economy of Oklahoma City or even of the state of Oklahoma itself, but had little effect on the national economy.  Fourth, recency. The 7/7 bombings occurred in 2005, making them the most recent, but this seems to be less of a factor than the factors mentioned above -- they may be memorable to citizens of the UK and most especially to Londoners, but I doubt it had much global impact. To my knowledge, no studies have been done on the global recognition of the 7/7 bombings.  However, me might look at recency in events with similar casualty counts and media coverage, such as between 9/11 and Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor occurred in 1941. The youngest people alive who experienced it as it happened (even as infants) are 73 years old this year. By contrast, the youngest people alive who were alive (even as infants) during 9/11 are 13 years old. 6% of people alive today in the US remember Pearl Harbor as it happened;  by contrast, 80% of the people alive today in the US remember 9/11 as it happened. US Census data. This may be a contributing factor in the attention given to 9/11 over other attacks.  Fifth, total destruction. OKC and the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center totally destroyed their targets. The 7/7 bombings damaged some trains and may have caused some infrastructure damage to the tunnels, but ultimately did not destroy the London Underground, and from my research, it appears that the routes affected by the bombings are still in use today. Notably, the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon tends to be de-emphasized in memorial media; it did not destroy the Pentagon, the Pentagon was not converted into a memorial site like the OKC site and 9/11 Ground Zero and death tolls at the Pentagon were lower than other targets affected by the attack.",
            " There are probably a few contributing factors: how recent the event is, the death toll, degree of damage, media coverage of the event, notability of the target.  The Oklahoma City Bombing killed 168 people and injured 680 others. It caused an estimated $652 million dollars in damage. It occurred 6 years prior to 9/11, and targeted the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building, which, while it may have been a landmark for citizens of Oklahoma City, was largely unknown to citizens outside of that area. The remains of the building were demolished a month after the attacks.  9/11 killed 2,996, caused over 6,000 injuries, and an estimated $10 billion in damage.

            " The main thing to remember about 9/11 in comparison to the Oklahoma bombings and the 7/7 bombings in London, is the media spectacle that surrounded 9/11.   9/11 occurred in the most important and the most heavily mediated city in the western world.

    "\n\nHuman: Serious question: Why does the US support Israel? Whenever I wonder about political stuff, I try to apply Occam's razor, and think about the simplest reasoning behind everything. It seems obvious that the US would want a strong ally in the Middle East post-WWII, to establish influence against the Warsaw Pact, but that was a long time ago, and even with that kind of reasoning, how does Israel receive *so* much aid?  What confuses me even more is that the US seems to struggle with Israeli policy, even though it has massive leverage over the country. Israeli militants do things like invade Lebanon or push Palestinians off their land and the US doesn't do much about it (I'm assuming here that if the US really wanted to do something about it, it would have). Wouldn't it make more sense to try gaining the trust of Muslim countries, since the US is doing so much in the Middle East right now?   Some people say that the Jewish lobby in the US is really strong. From what I understand though, it's more of a Jewish lobby and less of an Israeli one, isn't it? I feel like American Jews are distinct from Israeli ones. I could be gravely mistaken, obviously.\n\nAssistant:": {

Some money might come from states, which each have their own safety net programs that would become redundant. States overall spend about $250 billion source. This would reduce the amount needed to $1.35 trillion. If all of that came from new federal taxes, that would be about a 33% increase overall.  There is no consensus on where that extra money would come from, but no one that I've seen has proposed cutting education. Most people advocating UBI also advocate universal healthcare, so any monies going to Medicare/Medicade/CHIP now would be redirected to some US version of the UK's NHS. Most proposals call for tax reform (especially cutting corporate tax loopholes) but there would need to be significant increases in revenue, which would have other economic consequences.

            " I read Freakonomics and Superfreakonomics when I was in high school, and they are the reason I majored in econ and went on to pursue a Ph.D. That said, I later learned about a number of things wrong with the books.   The first one is fine enough, as long as you know the issues with the abortion claim (Levitt bases his argument on a paper of his which had a coding and methodological errors). But it highlights a lot of cool research on other topics that I found interesting enough as an undergrad. E.g., the economics of acting white, Levitt's work on prison populations and crime.  Superfreakonomics was perhaps almost as controversial, namely due to its long climate change section. The article I linked covers its issues but also says what they did wasn't *that* bad, other than basing that chapter on wacky ideas and little data.   I haven't read the other two books they wrote. I haven't even heard good or bad things about them. They just seem like rehashings of the same old thing.  In sum, I'd say the Freakonomics guys tend to make stronger claims than the data warrants, and that might be bad for science. But remember what these books are: Pop science meant to get the public interested in econ and thinking about things they never thought of before. In that, Freakonomics succeeds.   My verdict: Read them at least once in your lifetime, especially if you're in high school or an undergrad. Do try to wean yourself off of taking the books too seriously once you graduate. The podcast actually has some pretty neat topics sometimes. And they are making a new game show that will be airing in NYC in September.",

    "\n\nHuman: Besides Japan, in what other modern cultures is hugging not a thing at all, for pretty much everyone? It's always bizarre, to me, to see Japanese people meet old friends and family they haven't seen for a long time, and be clearly happy to see each other, but not feel moved to physically touch each other at all. I've heard it said that the Japanese are the most touch-averse culture on earth, but then again, there are a lot of uninformed superlative \"facts\" about that nation that get bandied about, that have no data to back them up.  I will say this, though: to this Anglo-American who has traveled extensively throughout Eastern Europe, Asia, and all of North America, the Japanese are certainly the most noticeably touch-averse people *I've* encountered. I've heard it said that the British, Finns, Koreans, and people from the Indian subcontinent described as decidedly non-touching cultures. I've met and observed a lot of people of all of these nationalities. And while all of them certainly touch and embrace much less than my culture, I *have* seen people from all of these places spontaneously hug or touch. All of these peoples seem to observe fairly strict rules about when it can happen and who can touch whom, and one won't be faulted for erring on the side of never touching anyone. But none of them have taken the aversion to any deliberate physical human contact to the level the Japanese have, in my observation. But this is only one man's experience.  Can anyone recommend me some literature about \"touching cultures\" versus \"non-touching cultures\", and what a culture's place on this gamut tends to correlate with?\n\nAssistant:": {

Can't blame the researchers. Most economists are anal about causality; endogeneity is always a huge concern in econ but other social scientists don't seem to care enough about. And I would say the financial crisis is a very good reason not to pay attention to other fields. There's a huge gulf in how economic researchers interested in the financial crisis understand it (money market run) compared to well, the understanding of almost everyone else (bad bets on subprime mortgages).  and   >It's not an unheard of criticism. Even Piketty calls out mainstream econ's apparent distaste for inputs that come from sociology, anthropology and behavioral studies, and considers it detrimental to econ as a whole.  and  >It is BS. Economics is the strongest of the social sciences (especially now). Just because people didn't listen to economists and had a financial crisis doesn't mean the field should change in any way.

            " There is a language and paradigm gap. Economics requires a fair amount of mathematics, and those sufficiently trained in math have made the jump (Kahneman). Additionally, mainstream economics has rejected much of Marx's work and diverged from the rest of the social sciences where parts of his work are foundational texts. Lastly, the other social sciences are several decades behind on empirical work. They do simple linear regressions and ignore questions of causality and endogeneity, which hasn't been acceptable in economics for the longest time.

But the long and the short of it is that, for most people who use rational choice theory, rational choice theory can be used to sufficiently explain many human phenomena.  Originally, rational choice theory was confined to mainly the allocation of scarce resources (the traditional domain of economics) but increasingly it's being used to explain much more.  Gary Becker really started that revolution in mainstream economics, looking at so much more than market behavior and consumption patterns.   The above article was written at a time when it looked like rational choice was going to take over sociology, when James Coleman was bringing rat choice models into sociology, when he was regularly collaborating with Becker himself, and they were found new journals, like Social Science Research.  It didn't catch on in sociology, but what sociologists wouldn't for the most part do (in part because our training in rational choice is *horrible*--other than people who went to UChicago in the 1980's and 1990's, it seems like most sociologists only treat rational choice as a laughable boogey man), economists did themselves in what's called \"Economic Imperialism\".

Like the physical sciences, economics uses a methodology that produces refutable implications and tests these implications using solid statistical techniques. In particular, economics stresses three factors that distinguish it from other social sciences. Economists use the construct of rational individuals who engage in maximizing behavior. Economic models adhere strictly to the importance of equilibrium as part of any theory. Finally, a focus on efficiency leads economists to ask questions that other social sciences ignore. These ingredients have allowed economics to invade intellectual territory that was previously deemed to be outside the discipline's realm.  I'd say that's a different way of saying the \"clean models\" thing.  Economists are well aware of this drift into areas once covered by other fields. The well-known microeconomist Bryan Caplan has a very insightful blog post called \"In a Perfect World, I'd Call Myself a Sociologist\".  There's an old joke that goes something like, \"The difference between economists and everyone else is that economist assume people are fundamental the same.\"  This lets them try to answer a lot of questions that other social sciences feel like they can't.  And it also means that they often don't need to read other fields' \"theories\" because in rational choice they already have a convincing theory, to say nothing about methods.  While economists might accept some lab experiments from psychology, they tend to prefer causal methods and discount even quantitive methods from other social sciences that aren't experimental or quasi-experimental (IVs, regression discontinuity, etc), for applied micro, at least.  While some have argued that economic theory is actually largely qualitative and only hidden under a thin veneer of equations--this is the argument of economics' most famous Cassandra, Deirdre McCloskey, in her excellent *Secret Sins of Economists* (full PDF here)--there of course hasn't been any openly qualitative economics in generations, which means that many discount economics work out of hand (McCloskey's pamphlet of a book is a great read; for critics of economics, it lays out some clear virtues, and for proponents of economics, it makes some strong arguments for certain vices).  While there has been challenges from within economics to several parts of rational choice theory's core assumptions--that all people all the same and culture has some clear importance in behavior has recently been challenged (probably most famously in the really dope article \"In Search of Homoeconomicus\"), as has the whole idea that people are rational utility maximizers (basically by the whole field of behavioral economics)--this of course hasn't caused an abandonment or even retreat from economics's core ideas or the increased adoption of theory from other social sciences (except some social psychology).  But while others will point to methods (which are undeniably more statistically sophisticated) or training (which is undeniably more rigorous for the modal student), I really think it's economics' clear, universalist theory that really sets it apart.",

        "sft_target": " I won't address the substance of what people said on other subreddits.  Economics is really the most like physics, in that it comes up with neat equations that are useable for predictions.  There's actually a great sociology article that lays out a lot of the differences called \"'Dirty Hands' versus 'Clean Models': Is Sociology in Danger of Being Seduced by Economics?\"  This chart sort of summarizes its arguments of the differences.  But the long and the short of it is that, for most people who use rational choice theory, rational choice theory can be used to sufficiently explain many human phenomena.  Originally, rational choice theory was confined to mainly the allocation of scarce resources (the traditional domain of economics) but increasingly it's being used to explain much more.  Gary Becker really started that revolution in mainstream economics, looking at so much more than market behavior and consumption patterns.   The above article was written at a time when it looked like rational choice was going to take over sociology, when James Coleman was bringing rat choice models into sociology, when he was regularly collaborating with Becker himself, and they were found new journals, like Social Science Research.  It didn't catch on in sociology, but what sociologists wouldn't for the most part do (in part because our training in rational choice is *horrible*--other than people who went to UChicago in the 1980's and 1990's, it seems like most sociologists only treat rational choice as a laughable boogey man), economists did themselves in what's called \"Economic Imperialism\".  That's not an insult, that's the name of an economics article praising this development.  Here's the abstract, which I think gives a sense of why many economists think so highly of themselves and so poorly of other social scientists.  I mean, just peep the first line:  >Economics is not only a social science, it is a genuine science. Like the physical sciences, economics uses a methodology that produces refutable implications and tests these implications using solid statistical techniques. In particular, economics stresses three factors that distinguish it from other social sciences. Economists use the construct of rational individuals who engage in maximizing behavior. Economic models adhere strictly to the importance of equilibrium as part of any theory. Finally, a focus on efficiency leads economists to ask questions that other social sciences ignore. These ingredients have allowed economics to invade intellectual territory that was previously deemed to be outside the discipline's realm.  I'd say that's a different way of saying the \"clean models\" thing.  Economists are well aware of this drift into areas once covered by other fields. The well-known microeconomist Bryan Caplan has a very insightful blog post called \"In a Perfect World, I'd Call Myself a Sociologist\".

            " Data shows that age groups tend to hold distinctive political stances. For example, teenagers are most likely to be libertarians; college aged young people, liberals; career aged (30-60), conservatives; elderly folks, statists.   From a glance, it appears that people become less socially liberal as they age, and where they stand on fiscal issues is related to how economically vulnerable they are (teens, safely under parents' roofs; people in their 20s, out on their own for the first time; older people, solidly in the apex of their careers; the elderly, obviously vulnerable).   What is complicated is that correlation != causation. Like some commenters here mentioned, our political leanings could be byproducts of our society's values (relatively speaking) when we were young. It's not hard to imagine, for instance, that teenagers when they were polled were influenced by Ron Paul - and many of them are in college now, explaining his current popularity on campuses.   It's my semi-educated opinion is that age is both cause and effect. (Social scientists, please feel free to criticize my hypothesis here.) Studies appear to show social liberalism is strongly related to one's fluid intelligence, and people tend to start declining in this department while young (at ~30 years old IIRC). I'm not saying it's the only cause but that it could play a part.   Also, people tend to become more conscientious as they age (at least from 30 to 60). Conservative people tend to be more conscientious. Interestingly enough, one's IQ score is negatively correlated with their conscientiousness. There are possible explanations but that's another topic.   I'm on iPhone right now. Will gladly provide sources if requested (and others are welcome to help out because it could be a while before I get on a computer).",

            " Data shows that age groups tend to hold distinctive political stances. For example, teenagers are most likely to be libertarians; college aged young people, liberals; career aged (30-60), conservatives; elderly folks, statists.   From a glance, it appears that people become less socially liberal as they age, and where they stand on fiscal issues is related to how economically vulnerable they are (teens, safely under parents' roofs; people in their 20s, out on their own for the first time; older people, solidly in the apex of their careers; the elderly, obviously vulnerable).   What is complicated is that correlation != causation. Like some commenters here mentioned, our political leanings could be byproducts of our society's values (relatively speaking) when we were young. It's not hard to imagine, for instance, that teenagers when they were polled were influenced by Ron Paul - and many of them are in college now, explaining his current popularity on campuses.   It's my semi-educated opinion is that age is both cause and effect. (Social scientists, please feel free to criticize my hypothesis here.) Studies appear to show social liberalism is strongly related to one's fluid intelligence, and people tend to start declining in this department while young (at ~30 years old IIRC). I'm not saying it's the only cause but that it could play a part.   Also, people tend to become more conscientious as they age (at least from 30 to 60). Conservative people tend to be more conscientious. Interestingly enough, one's IQ score is negatively correlated with their conscientiousness. There are possible explanations but that's another topic.   I'm on iPhone right now. Will gladly provide sources if requested (and others are welcome to help out because it could be a while before I get on a computer).",

            " No.  It's about voter participation.     People largely maintain their belief system that they created during what is referred to as the \"formative years\" of political ideological development (this stage largely being influenced by the exposure to post-secondary education **AND their parent's political ideololgy**).  This has the effect of increasing voter participation in those that do attend post-secondary education.   What does increase with age is voter participation.   Since those that attend post-secondary education are most likely liberal leaning and since that slice of the population is a minority their political influence continually wanes as they get older.  This is because non-post secondary educated individuals who hold more conservative viewpoints who didn't vote in their 20's - 30's start voting.  Since their voting block is much bigger than those that attend college, you start to see a \"right of center\" voting pattern in the US.  This is why youth movements are almost always liberal and conservative movements hold a near perfect 40+ voting age.   **TL;DR: There are way more undereducated conservatives but they don't start voting in \"Force\" till they turn 35-40 ish. This gives the allusion that people become conservative with age, but rather its already conservative people who never voted before start voting.**   This is the primary reason Democrats want to expand post-secondary education and Republicans generally oppose such expansion.

Having a bound / applied tariff gives a country room to adjust their tariff policies in the event of some domestic issues, shock to commodity prices, etc. Anyway, the WTO is primarily about getting countries to stop using non-tariff barriers to trade (so things like local content requirements or not applying international patent laws).

Bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements and investment treaties go much further than the WTO. They include detailed provisions on non-tariff barriers which are MORE stringent than those of the WTO in addition to requiring lower tariffs. Even though these agreements reduce a country's policy space to choose their optimal trade policy (and trade policy is a very important tool for development - virtually all developed countries used these now forbidden non-tariff barriers to build their own manufacturing base), they provide better than market access to the other country than can be achieved through the WTO.

    "\n\nHuman: vet said my dog is very sick?? - English bulldog Hi there, I'm looking for any advice a vet can offer   This afternoon, I took my English bulldog (M 10) to a new vet. He's been looking kinda mopey at times. I just had this feeling to get him looked at and get x-rays.  He has a cough that was noted before by my regular vet, but that could also be common in bulldogs.  Otherwise, he seems very healthy and happy. He goes for regular walks, plays and runs, & eats as much as he can always.  This afternoon I took him to the new vet for x-rays (cost related), and I was not left feeling confident at all with him. He came in, and the first thing he said is my dog is very sick. He showed me the x-rays and said he has fluid around his heart, & from what he pointed out I can't disagree. He said his heart is very large, but didn't give me a baseline of what would be normal; he also asked if my dog was a Frenchie when we walked in, so idk what standard he's comparing to when you can't even tell the difference between an adult Frenchie and English bulldog. The vet also said he has a lot of air in his abdomen. My boy has always had a lot of gas, another common trait of bulldogs, so not sure again how the x-ray compares to normal for his breed. lastly, he said my dog has bronchitis, consistent with the cough we've been keeping an eye on (no change to it in 2 months).  Treatment suggested was; medication for the bronchitis, and surgery to determine the cause of & reduce the fluid around the heart. I'm nervous if surgery as the risk is much higher for Bulldogs. Or, he said to just enjoy the time with him as he's already very old (10 yrs is THAT old? He still plays & acts like a puppy)  I immediately scheduled an appointment with my regular vet and for the x-rays to be sent to her, but she can't see us until next Wednesday. I'm hoping someone can look at them & lmk if I should be as concerned as the vet made it seem, and thus seek another opinion much sooner than Wednesday.  A second opinion on how the x-rays look would be really appreciated!!  x-ray pics here  Thank you in advance! I'm literally so uneasy and worried about my baby after that appointment.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " The x-rays are difficult to read, so getting it sent out to a radiologist would be ideal for more definitive answers but there is definitely concerning results.  It\u2019s never bad to get a second opinion though.  Normally in radiographs the lung field should be clear and black meaning the lungs are full of air. There\u2019s a lot of white seen in the lungs. Additionally, you shouldn\u2019t see the stomach/intestines so clearly. Yes it\u2019s normal to see some amount of gas sometimes but the entire stomach and intestines should not be fully outlined and filled with gas like that.   The only thing I\u2019m iffy on is your doctor saying there\u2019s fluid around the heart. Possible, but this x-ray isn\u2019t entirely clear. You can always follow up with your regular vet, but if you have the money you may also want to look into seeing a specialist as far as the heart/lungs are concerned.  Also very unsure about what surgery your doctor would suggest? X rays can give you differential diagnosis options as far as medication goes, but idk what surgery they would want to proceed with?  Furthermore, IF there is fluid as your doctor diagnosed that is typically treated with doing a -centesis (or tap) to remove fluid from whatever area. (Ex: removing fluid from abdomen is abdominocentesis). While centesis is a sterile procedure, especially if involving the heart, it\u2019s not considered surgery.  I would recommend following up with your doctor for better answers. Just let them know you\u2019re a little bit confused. And then you can also get a second opinion with your regular vet who has a more clear history of your pet.  I wish you luck with everything and hope they can help your baby :) \u2764\ufe0f",

    "\n\nHuman: Vet says rescue cat will have to be put down if \u201clight \u201c biting for attention continues. Friend adopted rescue spayed 1-2 year old cat 3 months ago from shelter. Cat was skinny with patchy fur. Took to vet first week home. Healthy. Has gained good weight. Fur looks great. Took back to vet for nail clipping. Told vet about new behavior of \u201clight \u201c biting for attention. Vet says to say \u201cNO!\u201d and  smack  on the butt with rolled up newspaper. Says that if this behavior continues the cat should be put down as it could lead to a \u201cfull on attack.\u201d This is a household with no other pets and 3 older people. Main caretaker is 70 year old woman to whom cat has bonded. Cat pretty much ignores other 2 housemates: 75 year old man and 87 year old woman. Both like cat, give treats and affection. There has been no physical violence or rough treatment by anyone to cat in new Home.   I am  a dog owner and have no experience with abnormal cat behavior but this doesn\u2019t sound like any kind of good plan to me. Advice needed please.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: I'm stuck in lockdown - and my dog ate a seed he's having trouble passing Hello all. My dog ate a medium-sized longan seed roughly three days ago. He cannot keep down any food and is rather lethargic, though there are no bloating or other signs of pain. He's been vomiting all the food that we've given him over the past 12 hours and cannot hold down anything but water. We're in Shanghai, which is currently under the strictest lockdown in the world and there is no possible way we can get him to a vet.  Is there anything at all that I can do at home to help him with passing the seed? Any oils, foods, etc. that could lubricate it? We're very afraid that this could turn into a full intestinal blockage soon. There's very little chance we can get him in front of a vet, so any advice at all would be appreciated. Thank you.  EDIT:   He's a six-month-old pomeranian puppy. I don't know how much he weighs, but he's quite light and small. He has no medical history besides pooping blood for about three days roughly one month ago.\n\nAssistant:": {

It was a soft bite, I didn't bleed and it didn't even leave a mark. After that the cat stood still in the spot and I went to wash the area of the bite after 5-10 mins.

    "\n\nHuman: Studies on delaying spaying and neutering? I recently adopted a stray female dog, and was advised by my vet that we should delay spaying her until after her first or second heat.  She indicated that some recent studies had shown there to be some health benefits found in delaying spaying and neutering, although I didn't press further.  She just completed her first heat, what has been a rather frustrating experience (wrestling a hyperactive puppy into diapers multiple times a day, being able to fully socialize her in the dog park with potentially unaltered males, etc.).  Can anyone link me to the studies showing this, especially if they happen to be in an open access journal?  I'd like to better understand the benefits and drawbacks, and I figure going back to the original published research might help.  I figure then I'll be able to look at the methodology (RCT? Cohort study?) , sample size, figure out absolute vs relative risk, number needed to treat, etc.  Also, am I mistaken that previous thought was that early spaying and neutering had health benefits?  How are those supposed benefits of early spaying/neutering balanced against the supposed benefits of later spaying/neutering?  Thanks!\n\nAssistant:": {

This is because of the way that some of the sex hormones interacts with growth hormone and it may result in them growing too tall, which may predispose them to joint issues.  In small and medium breed dogs the effect isn't as significant.  Let's start by defining a \"spay\" as an ovariohysterectomy, or a surgery where the uterus and ovaries are removed completely.  Pre-pubertal spaying is most commonly advised due to the fact that it decreases the risk of beast cancer. \"Mammary tumors are more common in female dogs that are either not spayed or were spayed after 2 years of age. The risk of a dog developing a mammary tumor is 0.5% if spayed before their first heat (approximately 6 months of age), 8% after their first heat, and 26% after their second heat. Cats spayed before 6 months of age have a 7-times reduced risk of developing mammary cancer and spaying at any age reduces the risk of mammary tumors by 40% to 60% in cats.\" (https://www.acvs.org/small-animal-es/mammary tumors)  However everything has advantages and disadvantages.  Early spaying will greatly reduce the risk of mammary cancer.  Spaying at any point in the pet's lifetime will prevent uterine, ovarian and vaginal cancer, and will prevent pyometra.  Studies have found that spaying will mildly increase things like hip dysplasia, cranial cruciate disease, some cancers including lymphoma and mast cell tumour.  It moderately increases the longevity of the pet and it is linked to urinary sphincter incompetence. (https://files.brief.vet/migration/article/30161/amo_age-of-neutering-in-large--giant-breed-dogs-30161-article.pdf)  In my opinion, if you do not plan to breed with a pet it should be sterilised. Like you said it's messy to deal the nappies when they are in heat and trying to keep a pup away from intact male dogs.  The other big advantage is decreased risk of mammary cancer and increased life expectancy.  The disadvantages like obesity and urinary incontinence are easily prevented and treated respectively.  These disadvantages do not validate the increased risk of mammary cancer and the trouble heat behaviour causes and elicits in other dogs in my opinion.  Younger dogs tolerate anaesthesia much better and are less likely to have complications than middle aged or older dogs.  Once a dog develops pyometra she also becomes very unstable and anaesthesia may be life threatening in severe cases.  The reason I focus so much on the mammary cancer vs the increased risk of other cancers like lymphoma and mast cell is because mammary cancer has been proven to have a hormonal influence and has been proven to be less prevalent in spayed dogs.  Lymphoma and mast cell tumour are not hormonally influenced cancers, and the increased risk may be due to the fact that spayed dogs live longer, and not as a direct result of a spay.

    "\n\nHuman: Vet gives ultimatum for cat diagnosed with breast cancer, but the cat is still healthy and living after 6 months Last year I adopted an adorable domestic shorthair cat. She is soon 6 years old. I found her randomly on Facebook and fell in love with her. When I picked her up, her previous owner told me that she does not know much about the cat, as she got it from someone else too and I suppose she didn't care much. Even though her previous owner did not give a flying BEEP about her and allegedly did not know if the cat is vaccinated or any of her medical history, I wanted to save her and give her a permanent home. 4 months went by and I managed to save enough money to get her to the vet and spay her. I took her to the vet and the doctor told me she will give me a call when she is done with the surgery. I leave the vet clinic and as soon as I get home I receive a call from the vet saying that they will not be able to perform the surgery because they found two cysts on the cats abdominal area. The doctor said there is a 90% chance that those would be malignant tumors and the cat has mammary cancer. Of course, I started crying as I grew very attached to the cat in the time I spent with her. The doctor then urged me to make a quick decision as the cat was still under anaesthesia, either sample the tumor to make sure it's malign, go through surgery or put her down. This was a very hard decision for me.   First of all, sampling the tumor or performing the surgery right away would have been extremely expensive and I did not have the money at the time, and second of all, I cannot just put down my cat while I am having a breakdown. I felt like my world fell apart in that moment. Quickly made an appointment at another clinic for a second opinion. I asked the doctor if I have time to start a GoFundMe to get the money as quick as possible and have surgery done and they told me that there is no time and no reason to do that because the cat was still under anaesthesia and I should decide in that moment. If I could go back in time I would tell them how unprofessional it is to make a cat parent go through such a thing. In the end, when they saw that I could not decide as they left me no choice but to put her down in that moment to not 'waste the anaesthesia', they said that there is no point to perform a surgery or sample anyway because there is a high chance that the cat will die under surgery anyway. After hearing this, I cancelled the other appointment check up I had made at the other clinic, as I saw no point in it anymore.   I want to mention that I have nothing against putting down pets, it was just the shock that made me freeze. Incapable of making a choice, I opted to wait for the cat to wake up and to take her home. I rushed back to the clinic and I met the doctor who then advised me to keep an eye out for any signs of illness, as the cat was feeling fine at the time. Doctor gave the cat one month to live... You can judge all you want but I felt it was shocking and cruel to put down a perfectly healthy and happy cat at that time.  As the weeks went by I went through a period of grieving, preparing to say my goodbyes to my sweet little kitty. Spoiled her tons, gave her the space she needed, her favourite snacks...and I waited.  I live in northern Europe where it's extremely expensive to perform surgery, before anyone tries to jump at my neck for not going through with that. Would have costed me about 3300 US Dollars for the surgery, plus an extra 1000 to see if its a malignant tumor, something that my student job would not be able to cover. The check up they did which only included shaving the hair and the anaesthesia costed me 200 US Dollars. I knew this was going to be a very expensive journey and was ready to take out a loan if I could, start a funding campaign, anything. Gave up on the thought because of the vet's advice.  It's been 6 months since then and she is still here. Still normal bowel habits, appetite of an alligator, sociable attitude, pukes once every two weeks and it's always hairballs. And I am wondering, where did me or the vet go wrong here? Is it possible the cat is indeed sick but not showing it? Was it an attempted money grab by the clinic? Could the chest lumps be something else? (I cannot feel or see them anymore as the cat's hair has completely grown back)  TLDR: 6 year old female domestic shorthair cat got diagnosed with mammal cancer, vet did not give her long to live but she is still alive and thriving after 6 months.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Cat hurt his hind leg and now is barely eating and laying near the warm boiler all the time. So a few days ago my cat (female, about 18, tabby, spayed, healthy weight and usually active) tried to jump up onto the kitchen sink counter. She would recently like to lay in the sink and watch the water drops and lick them. So she missed or got hind leg caught and started limping.   After that happened, she started being depressed looking. Barely eating. Barely drinking. She could stand on her leg but ever so slightly. Now, she's been laying down by my home heat furnace thing, which is near her litter box.  Sometimes she would go into the box, pee, and lay down in the box. 50/50 if she would leave or not.   I don't see any breathing problems. I can move her and she would walk back to that spot. Leg doesn't look broken as she can put pressure on it and walk slowly. Although it sometimes slides away from her.   I'm sorry if it's this is all over the place. Hard for me to see her like this.  Ever since her leg pain, she just lays down and barely wants to eat or drink. She's still attentive when I call her name. Don't know what to do. Thank you   Here is pic https://imgur.com/a/3wUbHdc\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: My cats can\u2019t recognize eachother after grooming. Hi guys, I\u2019m in a problem and need your help because it\u2019s making me sad. I took my 2 cats last week to get groomed, putting them both in one cage on the way to the vet and back home. While coming back home, my senior cat (7 y/o) was happily licking the younger cat (2 y/o) and they both seemed okay. The moment we got home and let the 2 cats out of their cage, they started sniffing eachother and I could tell something was wrong. The senior immediately started chasing the younger cat and both of them clashed. This continued for 2 days everytime they spot eachother, the senior would always run and chase the younger. Until the senior eventually somehow recognized the younger, but the younger cat remained defensive, always looking around for the senior and frightened he may attack him again. It\u2019s been a week, my senior cat is depressed because he misses my younger cat. The younger cat is always defensive, hissing at my younger cat if he gets close to him. Always looking at the doors like he\u2019s anticipating the senior any time for an attack. Meanwhile the senior cat looks at the younger with sad eyes until eventually got tired and actually started to be afraid of him and hating to get close to the younger.   I desperately need your help guys.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Question about my kitten that we just had to put to sleep... So alright here's the basics... Name: Blackie Age 11mo. Weight: 4lbs (not a typo) Neutered: yes  He has a fairly long history as we've been back and forth to the vet a ton of times since January... Here goes what I can remember. First vet visit was because he was only having small amounts of stools, always diarrhea, with blood and clear mucus. Vet said probably worms, gave a bunch of meds: albon, metronidazole & one other I cannot remember but was a dewormer or antibiotic... It's something common and it's on the tip of my tongue.   Anyway didn't work. Bring him back, she says ok maybe it's giardia and treats with panacur. That didn't work either. After that they kept him all day, did bloodwork & an xray, kept him all day for a barium swallow to make sure he is passing everything fine. He was cleared and sent home. They could not retrieve a stool sample all day so I was sent home and tasked with this. Was told by a different vet when I picked him up that some of his bloodwork was abnormal and consistent with FIP and that if it wasn't tritrichomonas, which they suspected but wanted to confirm with PCR because of the side effects of ronidazole.   Finally get a stool sample a few days later and they send it off for a PCR test. Was positive for tritrichomonas. Treated with ronidazole, standard dose for 14 days. Seemed better but got worse again, so they retreated him thinking maybe since he's so small and weak it wasn't cleared out of him completely. I finished that 14 day regimen Saturday. In the meantime I've forgotten that they ever mentioned FIP to me and he's seeming more bright and alert so I take that as a positive sign.  I spend the next day bleaching the litter boxes and I also gave him a bath cause he had made a mess of himself with feces and was sickly and not really cleaning well. I will note but I'm not sure if it matters that he was weird about his food this whole time. LOVES wet food, would cry and cry for it and I fed him as often as he wanted cause he was so small and I just wanted to get weight on him but he would get picky and food he previously loved, he wouldn't eat. Never knew what was up with that but it was pretty discouraging. Needless to say he never gained any weight back, he started out at 6.5lbs when I initially brought him to the vet and just to clarify he was still probably 6mo. Old kitten size & the vet told me his growth was probably stunted.  After the bath I gave him on Sunday he started acting a little weird, like wobbly and wasn't walking well and I was concerned maybe I got water in his ears and I read online that it's generally harmless and will clear up so I didn't think much of it. I blow dried him a bit with my hair dryer on low and then let him rest on a heated blanket.   I woke up on Thursday morning and he wasn't moving. He was breathing but not moving, I picked him up his eyes seemed OK and responsive, I asked him if he was hungry because usually he excitedly responds but he didn't. I tried to feed him but he wouldn't eat. He tried to get up and wobbled and fell over. I immediately brought him to the vet (a different one closer to my house cause this was an emergency) and they took him back to try and get blood and evaluate him. They got his history from my other vet. The vet came and told me his gums were pale and that they couldn't even draw blood cause he was so frail and she basically said his heart isn't pumping enough blood and that it's not looking good. That I could transfer him to a specialty hospital for a blood transfusion and hospitalization but the outcome would still be uncertain. By the time she brought him back to me he was already starting to pass, so we opted to have him euthanized. She said his symptoms were consistent with FIP from what she can tell and that's when I remembered the other vet mentioned that at the very beginning.   What is really eating at me though and it's probably irrational is the bath I gave him. Did I make him worse by giving him a bath?? Did his body get too cold and the blood flow got worse and never recovered? He seemed to go downhill straight after that, though there were no clear signs, looking back that's all I can think. Please help me with some closure because all I can do is picture him dying on the table and thinking that I killed him by giving him a bath \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d   If you read this far thank you so much for caring about my sweet baby boy. He was so, so special to me and even though I had him for a short time I hope that he didn't spend these last few months suffering or in pain. He didn't seem like he was but I know cats can hide it well. I'm just a mess over this.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Its day 4 and puppy refuses to eat and has been vomitting multiple times Preface: we live in a very small Muslim Asian country where dogs aren't common and the vet here are Muslims who mostly see and treat cats a majority of their time, they're also not used to handling dogs in general from the experience we've had (I've nothing against the religion, this is just background info). The town I live in is tiny and the vet here is ill equipped; the next city over is a 2 hours car drive where they would have the equipment (i.e. an ultrasound) to try and find the cause of the problem.  Puppy is 5 months old, vaccinated, normally 13.5kg (30lbs) and we rescued him when he was approx 6 weeks old abandoned in a drainage (he's classed as a Southeast Asian village dog by EmbarkVet).  Summary of symptoms:  * Vomits multiple times * Lethargy * Refuses to eat * Weight loss * Very runny stool (occurred only once) * No fever  **Day 1**  I woke my pup up at 7am in his crate to see he's still somewhat asleep. This is weird as normally he'd wake me up and he would usually walk out of the crate within 5 seconds of me opening. We have our morning walk but I cut it short as I see he's not too energetic. I serve him breakfast kibbles and he refused his food. He refused lunch as well. He also refused his treats and would spit it out. I tried chicken breast and he ate it, so I served him a small amount of rice and chicken breast because it concerned me he wasn't taking anything. That was the only meal he had. He was very low energy the whole day and spent his time on the couch chilling. He also did not poop at all this day.  **Day 2**  I woke him up at 7am again to see he has vomited in his crate. He seemed energetic so we had a short walk and he finally pooped (solid stool) and on the way back, he vomited white/yellow foam bile. He vomited again two more times at home. We waited for the nearby vet to open at 9am to bring him. Vet prescribed metoclopramide (for the vomiting?), liver support pills and b-plex. They also gave us Royal Canin Convalesce Support (RCCS) to force feed him. Back home, he ends up vomiting out all the pills we gave and all the food we force fed. He also vomited every time he drank water. Puppy has no energy and we see visible weight loss  **Day 3**  I woke him up at 7am again and he's vomited 2 times in his play pen. We brought him back to the vet and told them about day 2. We asked for an IV drip (administered under the skin) as he was now skin and bones and dehydrated. He's also lost 1.5kg (3lbs). During this time, he had a runny stool outside the vet's office which the vet saw. No blood, just very runny. They prescribed metronidazole (antibiotics) which they helped him take. We also managed to get him to take the metoclopramide and both pills stayed down. We force fed him a small amount of the RCCS 2 hours after the vet visit and he puked it all out 5 minutes after. My SO & I decided to not feed him at all to allow his stomach to recover (after doing some googling) as we notice the vomiting happens after he drinks water or we feed him the RCCS. In the evening, we got him to take the pills but he puked out the antibiotics minutes after he drank a bit of water.  **Day 4**  This is where I'm at now, we just woke him up at 630am and it is now 8am my time. Luckily he hasn't vomited in his pen which is a positive sign but he still refuses food and has no energy. He's looking even thinner than he was yesterday. Our options are either, go to another vet nearby for a second opinion or drive up 2 hours to the city and get him checked there and ask for an ultrasound to see what's going on in his stomach. Or we stick to the prescribed plan and ride it out. We have not given him his pills yet this morning as we fear he may puke it out again. We feel quite defeated that everytime we force feed his pill or food, he is hating us for handling him in such a way and he ends up vomiting soon after.  Any advice?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: My dog\u2019s neuter stitches got removed too early My dog just got neutered on Monday and  today (3 days later) is the day I\u2019m supposed take his bandage off to medicate the scar with ointment per my vet\u2019s recommendation. I tried taking the bandage off at home but it was too strongly adhered to his skin so it was hurting him a lot as I tried peeling it off bit by bit. I ended up having someone take my dog to the vet to get his bandage removed. I couldn\u2019t go myself because I was sick. Another vet at the clinic ended up being available to simply remove a bandage, but the vet misunderstood and ended up taking off his stitches as well 3 days before they were ready to be removed. My dog came home and I was shocked to see that my dog no longer had his stitches in and I contacted the vet that operated on my dog. She told me that the stitches shouldn\u2019t have been removed and to keep applying ointment often. I\u2019m still very worried about the wound reopening and getting infected. please advice me about the best course of action at this point.\n\nAssistant:": {

Their pet is dying and they do not want to really accept it so they ask for a 'better' opinion that keeps their pet alive longer 5. They think they know more than the Vet they did go to, and want someone in the sub to confirm it.  The last two never happen in this sub, but I think it's new people posting one off questions.",
        "rejected_target": " And on the same token, people love to rant and rave about how all we do here is tell people to go to the vet... Like, yes? We don't have crystal balls and if you just want random guesses, that's what Google will give you. There are also so many ways we can help but people don't see those posts apparently."

    "\n\nHuman: My dog was given 8 hotdogs will he be ok Dog, German shepherd pit mix, possibly  some other breeds, but I know at least alot of those 2. 9 months not yet nutured between  40 and 50 lbs Only change is drinking more water than usual,  Hes eating food fine, I decreased the amount I normally give him to semi make up for the extra calories. He will sometimes be given a couple small slices of hotdog  but never more than equals half a hotdog in one day, and usually  I use peices of chicken breasts and parsnip and carrot slices for treats instead. He eats 3 cups of food a day sometimes a little less depending on if I'm doing a lot of training but I try to keep the treats healthy.  I was out running errands  and my aunt came over, previously  I told her the way to get my skittish puppyto to quickly  warm up was to give a few peices  of hotdog or chicken to him and she gave him a whole pack of hotdogs, that's alot of sodium so I'm worried. I might be overreacting  and that just giving  him plenty of water and more bathroom  breaks than usual  is sufficient  to flush  the sodium out, I just want to double check that hes gonna be ok\n\nAssistant:": {

We got her to the emergency vet immediately, he said last night she'd probably need the leg amputated but it was wait and see. See was put on a drip and sedated. Today she was given an x-ray. Her hip is broken, her poor leg is shattered but they said the big concern is her bladder isn't filling. They are keeping her again tonight, and will xray again tomorrow to see if her bladder is filling.

I'm sorry for the silly questions, I'm just wondering what the chances of her surviving are. If her bladder is ruptured will she have to be put down?

    "\n\nHuman: Dog just got diagnosed with a closed Pyometra an hour ago My dog is a 4 year old golden retriever, she\u2019s not spayed and has had no prior issues at all. I took my dog to the vet today for a checkup since for the past week she hasn\u2019t really been eating much and has been more depressive. We go in and the vet says she seems pretty healthy but wants to do an ultrasound, she finds that she has a closed pyrometra. At the moment it\u2019s not an urgent issue but she wants to take care of it before it becomes one, the only issue is that the estimate the vet gave us was $6-9k, which is not doable at all for a full time college student. I live in Northern California and I called UC Davis community vet services and they charge ~$5000. I don\u2019t know what to do because I legitimately can\u2019t afford to pay this, nor can any family member either. I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any ideas on how to pay such an amount.\n\nAssistant:": {

We use puppy pads, but he keeps falling in his poop, then he has a hard time getting up and smashes it all over the floor and all over his body.

    "\n\nHuman: Do cats know that their owner is with them during euthanasia despite being put to sleep before? Hello. My question may seem weird. I recently lost my baby, he was my everything. I only have him in my shitty life. And we really have a extraordinary bond together. He was my shadow. I met him on his very first day where he was thrown away in a closed trash bad with his brothers and sisters, in a freaking rainy night in the middle of October. Only 2 survived. I fed him like a baby. From the moment he could walk, he was ALWAYS after me and it never stopped. I was the only one who could touch him, kiss him.. he was always right next to me. He literally sleep with me, under the covers lol. He was the sweetest soul ever, so kind with me. Yet he was a tiger with people he didnt like, especially vets lol.   I had to take the worse decision ever. But I wanted to stay by his side until the very end. They first gave him a shot to make him sleep. And during that, I stayed with him, talked to him, kissed him, touched him. His eyes were still open but the vet told me that he was sleeping, such shot make them keep their eyes open.  And I stayed with him when they did the last shot, the pink one.  I was still talking to him, petting him, kissing him and then I was told \"There. He's gone now.\" His eyes were still open which broke my heart even more. I stayed with him until I was told to leave.   By your own experiences, do you think he was aware that he was not alone??? Do you think that despite the \"sleeping shot\" he could still hear me in a way?? Feel me??  I dont know if it is like a full anaesthesia or if it is closer to what is a sleeping pill to us. I have no idea. But the thing is, I once read that animals tend to look for their owner during such time. Yet mine was really sick. They took him in another room to do the first \"sleeping shot\" and came right after it. Yet when I took him in my arms, I think he was already sleeping because of how hard he was fighting. Maybe I am wrong. Maybe he was .. sleepy but not sleeping yet, just that his body was already \"off\". I'm not fluent, I'm French so I hope everything is understandable   Do you think despite that, he knew that his mommy was right next to him???\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Vet made a mistake and performed an unnecessary surgery. Seeking advice. I\u2019ll try to keep this short:  My dog had an ultrasound of his stomach and they detected a large mass. They referred me to another practice for surgery. The surgeon was reluctant to perform surgery without an endoscopy and biopsy, and I was in complete agreement. He sent me to their internal medicine department for the procedure.   The report came back and it was determined that the mass was in fact likely a benign polyp. While it was not life-threatening, it was probably causing my dog to vomit blood (which is why I brought him in to begin with) so we would go ahead and remove it surgically.   The surgeon called afterwards and informed me that he was actually not able to find ANYTHING in my dog\u2019s stomach; not a mass, not a polyp, nothing! He reached out to the internal medicine doctor who clarified that while he had indicated finding a \u201clarge mass\u201d during the endoscopy, what he actually MEANT to write in the report was \u201csmall lesion,\u201d and had the surgeon had the correct information, he would have never suggested surgery. Now the diagnosis is IBD.   Now my dog is suffering needlessly as he recovers from major surgery and no recompense has been offered for the $4000 spent on a procedure that should never have happened. To say I\u2019m livid would be the understatement of the century. I would like the perspective of a professional before I reach out to the hospital director. Should I demand my money back? Is this common?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Smelly cat, smelly cat... Winnie, our lovely cat suffered a head trauma last year in November 2019 that may have been caused by a car accident (we're not entirely sure as we didn't actually witness it, although he looked very rough and we think he was clipped rather than run over). At the time he had surgery to remove a canine fang and a general tidy up of\u00a0 the injury.\u00a0  During his recovery he had some nasal/eye discharge that was running clear, yellow and green at different times, which would sometimes dry off and look like it was clearing up but overall persisted.\u00a0  We brought him back into the vet in March earlier this year as a strong smell had been coming out of him, smelling like dead flesh or something really funky. He had also been sneezing frequently trying to clear whatever was bothering him. He was issued antibiotics and we all noticed the discharge and sneezing was markedly improved and the smell was almost gone. Unfortunately this didn't last, and so he was reissued a longer script to help combat these symptoms. We finished this script and the condition sadly returned again, this would have been  about early May 2020.  We emailed the vets with an update on his condition in June because he almost seemed worse than he originally started in terms of smell, sneezing and discharge. We wondered if there was any other possible explanation for his symptoms, such as a tooth socket gone septic from his original surgery, or even a possible broken tooth that is undetected.\u00a0The vets issued him a longer script of antibiotics which was supposed to completely address any issues of infection. He was on a 6 week course of antibiotics - day and night - which didn't make much of a difference. We are now in September and the antibiotics have been finished and we are back at square one and unsure what to do.  He really is a cool cat and it's a tragedy he is so smelly and offensive, it has completely affected his quality of life as he is very friendly and loves people but so smelly he cannot be petted. Every time he sneezes the smell is putrid and my poor parents don't know what to do. We have already invested a lot of money so don't know what else can be done but if there's a realistic solution we can explore then we would love to hear about it. We are thinking of requesting his full medical history and trying another vet for a second opinion as we really really want to help him get better but don't want another repeated course of antibiotics as it seems like a band-aid solution.   We are desperate for any recommendations or ideas. Please help :(\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: How to thank your vet - update original post here     My boy died on the operating table.   They rushed the close-up of him as he was reacting badly to the anaesthetic. The fight had left his body.   Obviously I am in shock.   I finished high school homeless. I have family, but they are not close. My wife and my two dogs are my family.      Gus was different.      When I was feeling my loneliest, isolated from COVID, Gus was there.      My other dog has a special relationship with my wife. If my wife shows any emotion, Bella (our other lab) is there, sitting on her chest. Comforting her. She loves me, but she *loves* my wife.      When I feel my most rejected. In my darkest place, Gus is there. We had such a strong bond. Honestly, I am closer to him than I have ever been to another living thing.      Tonight I am alone.   &#x200B;  The vets and the staff did everything they could. We bought Bella with us to say goodbye.      There was not a dry eye in the house.     I want to thank each and every member of a vet team. You are so special.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " I am so sorry you are facing the decision of euthanizing your animal, and I am equally sorry you have had such terrible experiences with euthanasia in the past.  When a vet or euthanasia tech prepares to euthanize a pet, they first anesthetize the animal so they are not awake when given euthanasia drugs. When an animal is anesthetized, they enter a state where they cannot form new memories or interpret pain. If you've had surgery where they put you to sleep, you probably experienced this state; you may remember how it felt to \"wake up\" like you'd travelled forward in time, but you likely had no memory of your surgery.   You don't remember what happened after the doctor counted down, but you probably seemed (somewhat) conscious to onlookers even after you stopped making memories. That quality is just about the first thing to go in anesthesia, but the brain is still \"awake\" enough to respond to stimuli. At this point you, or your pet, have entered the first of four anesthetic stages.  The second stage of anesthesia is likely to blame for your animals' startling behaviors. This is the excitatory stage; many people/animals make loud vocalizations and may thrash as the brain loses control of inhibitors that help it behave normally day-to-day. Memories and thoughts are still not stored during this process, so your f pets were likely unaware they were doing those things. It is very scary to witness, but it is also a common part of the anesthetic process for many individuals.   Stage three is when an animal becomes truly and deeply anesthetized; we want to perform surgery on or euthanize animals in stage three of anesthesia because brain activity beyond the basics of life support (breathing, heartbeat, etc) is not really present. The transition from life at this point is peaceful; a drug needs only to interfere with a basic life function to help an animal pass.   I'm so sorry if these words have been upsetting, but you really can help your pets pass with dignity. The procedure can be unpredictable, but I have never personally experienced the excitement phase during euthanasia (despite witnessing it many times in surgery). This is because the anesthetic process for euthanasia is not the same as for surgery; we understand an animal should not wake up after euthanasia, so we can use different kinds of anesthetic drugs, or bigger dosages given more quickly, to hopefully skip the second stage.  To prevent your past experiences from happening again, I would choose a different vet; you mentioned seeing two for multiple animals, but it's possible both employ the same anesthetic protocols. I recommend a mobile veterinary clinic or mobile euthanasia clinic if your community has one; your vets are likely great, but euthanasia clients are some of the most common cases seen by mobile clinics. It's only natural that, when you do something over and over, you become more familiar with it. Something else you can do is confirm with your vet that they are fully sedating an animal prior to euthanasia; not doing so is very rare in healthy animals, as it is not humane, but it has been known to happen in some lesser-developed areas due to the price of anesthetics.  We could talk about the most efficient methods to request, but this message is long enough. You must be grieving for your friend, but I hope some of this information helps you bury any guilt you may be carrying from your previous experiences. Despite what it seemed, I'm sure your animals were not aware of their actions when they passed. I hope instead that their last memory was slipping gently away, like counting backwards from 10, in the presence of the person they loved most.",

    "\n\nHuman: Should I shave my Chow-husky for the summer? Hey guys!  My husband and I rescued a chow-husky mix last July. When we got him, he was almost completely shaved, and covered in scars and chunks of hair missing. The animal shelter had an idea he was a chow mix because of his blue tongue, but wasn\u2019t sure because of how he looked brought in. Fast forward almost a year later, his fluffy hair grew out and he is quite a furry chow-husky mix. Here is a picture of the good boy for reference.  We live in Georgia and the summers here are brutal. We have taken him out on warm days to shaded patios for burgers and he didn\u2019t seem bothered, but people walking by always make comments; I.e: \u201cfluffy dog on a hot day, huh...?\u201d Or the classic \u201cman this summer is gonna be hard for him.\u201d. I have read an article on a chow breeder sight saying not to shave down their Fir because it acts as a insulation from heat and protection from sunburn, which they are prone to. We don\u2019t take him out for hikes or anything because he is an old boy (9 years old) and he would rather lounge inside.   I\u2019m confused on what to do... any advice would be amazing! Thank you!   Informations requested of this sub:  Species-Dog Age- 9 (the shelter estimate) Sex- Male, neutered  Breed- Chow-Husky mix (to our knowledge)  Body weight- 68lbs History- stray for 4 years and known to have had ring worm. Other than that, no other issues known.  Clinical signs- being fluffy Duration- almost a year of full hair growth?  General location - Atlanta area, GA Link - find link in comments above for a picture of the most handsome boy you\u2019ve ever laid eyes on.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: cmv: Cursive should be completely optional and not forced in schools. School already teaches quite a few chunks of useless information (which may deal with capitalism and stuff but i\u2019m getting off topic) already, and this includes literally forcing cursive on people.  &#x200B;  I don\u2019t see why you should be forcing cursive on people, The \"but its prettier\" is an opinion (which i agree with, but cursive isnt as legible to me)  and isn\u2019t a good reason.  The \"you wont be able to read historical documents\" argument is fair, but you\u2018re not just going to go waltzing into the white house and being granted permission to just go read the entire constitution, You\u2019re going to read it from a document online which is usually in print.  &#x200B;  The \"it\u2019s faster\" argument is dependent on the person, Some people write with cursive a lot better and faster but for me I write extremely sloppy with cursive (because i\u2019m not good at cursive and print is easier) and also slower.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  tl;dr : cursive should be an optional skill and you shouldnt be forced to write in it.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " I really think the issue is you haven't had enough practice with cursive. Where I went to school I had to learn cursive first and print second, and that was a deliberate decision made by the school because if you learn print first it can be difficult to learn cursive properly, however with that in mind, cursive is *incredibly* fast compared to print because you don't lift your pen nearly as much. Aesthetically, it's also much better again, with a bit of practice. Specifically, a 20 degree angle tilt and being mindful of spacing will make your cursive look much, much cleaner and make print look rather juvenile by comparison. Honestly, all things considered it could be argued that print is made optional and cursive the norm, because there's very little to learn in contrast to cursive.",

I think Andrew Neil's main point was that Ben Shapiro claims partisan divide is eating up America, but Ben Shapiro is contributing to that partisan divide with videos like 'Ben Shapiro **obliterates** college student'. But people who saw that video on the left are mostly using it to point out how dumb Ben Shapiro is and in doing so, *further the partisan divide*. I'm guilty of this myself, I do not like engaging with conservatives and have a negative view of their politics, but I can probably do better.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: Affirmative action would work best if directed at those in low socioeconomic standing, as opposed to those of minority race status. I know that affirmative action has come and gone here, but I'm not arguing about giving a leg up to those who have not experienced privilege. Rather, I would like to suggest that basing it on socioeconomic status instead of just race would do more to help.  1) If minorities are statistically prevalent in low socioeconomic standing, then providing affirmative action to all people of low socioeconomic standing would still proportionately benefit minorities.  1b) A more minor point, but doing so would eliminate sentiments of people who are white but poor that they are being reverse discriminated against. I'm not arguing that they are, just that this is a perception that cripples the purpose of the idea because it hastens support.  2) There are poor whites who are disadvantaged where a minority in higher socioeconomic standing may fill a quota and be able to qualify for (insert thing here) ahead of them.   3) By making affirmative action benefit all people impoverished, we actually treat everybody with the same dignity, but because of point 1, we avoid allowing traditionally privileged institutions from monopolizing their societal influence for future generations.   Notes:  a) I understand that there is definitely a distinction between privilege and wealth, and I am in no means trying to d an apologist for those who believe in reverse discrimination. I merely hope to highlight that within all of that bullshit may be a grain of truth.  b) I feel that this is the best way to address socioeconomic inequality because:  - educational attainment levels have traditionally correlated with socioeconomic success  - any system that highlights diversity as if it itself is a disadvantage seems to me to be inherently racist. It is not the minority status that disadvantages minorities, but the refusal of the privileged to grant equal status. By granting privilege to people based purely on economic need, it grants them privilege while both allowing its attainment to not be clouted with the ideas of determinism while also preventing those of privilege from refusing to acknowledge resultant achievements due to any perception of reverse discrimination (because right or wrong, the reality is that this perception exists).  I'm sure I'm lacking in some perspective here. I am white and grew up lower middle class, though we tasted poverty on more than one occasion.   So change my view!\n\nAssistant:": {

            " If you are at a drive-thru, or are outdoors where wind can make you lose a bill, the coins serve to keep the bill weighed down. Even when there's no wind, it helps customers keep from dropping their bills, because not everyone grasps their change before moving their hand.  If you worked a drive-thru window and applied both methods to practice as I and many people have done, you would find that coins on top of the bill results in less money being accidentally dropped by customers. There's no need to theorize which way is better when it can, and has, been rigorously applied in practice. That is probably why it seems to be ubiquitous. By the repetitive nature of their jobs, cashiers are fantastic at figuring out the most efficient way to do something, and they have experienced better outcomes by putting the coins on top.",

This is wrong and thoroughly annoying.  > When coins are put on notes they slide around and risk falling onto the floor.  You must be dealing with some slippery money then, I find the note usually helps envelop the coin and don't have any problems with slippage.  >People put notes away first as coins need your full attention to slide into your pocket/purse and so should be more readily available.  I often use the notes as a funnel for the coins to slip down into my pocket just before putting the note in. Either that or I safely fold the note around the coins and put it in my pocket to be dealt with later. In addition the coins actually help weigh down the notes so they don't go flying away if you make a swift movement or if you're at a street vendor on a windy day.  > If you wish to use two hands it is harder since you can't carefully pick the coins off the notes but it would be easy to pick the notes out of the other hand if they were on top of the coins  Actually putting coins on top of notes helps people deal with things more easily with one hand since the other hand usually has your wallet, purse, or a bag of groceries in it. If these transactions could be done easily with two hands it would be a moot point.",

            " I don't know that it counts as a justification, but here is a brief algorithmic history of counting back change:  Before cash registers as we know them, people still needed to make change.  The easiest way to ensure correct change and avoid subtraction error, especially in a time when shopkeepers weren't necessarily an educated populace, was to \"count up\" or \"count back your change.\"  If I gave (adjusting to modern prices) $20 for a $11.23 bill, the clerk would count change back to fixed points: multiples of $.05, $.10, $.25, $1, $5... (precisely the points at which our denominations change), and then increase the denomination with which they are counting your change.  So, to count back change for the above transaction would to do as you wish: begin with change, and work your way up.  * Total of $11.23 * Hand a penny.  Current total: $11.24 * Hand a penny.  Current total: $11.25 * $.25 mark hit.  Increase denomination. * Hand a quarter.  Current total: $11.50 * Hand a quarter.  Current total: $11.75 * Hand a quarter.  Current total: $12.00 * $1 mark hit.  Increase denomination. * Hand a $1 bill.  Current total: $13.00 * Hand a $1 bill.  Current total: $14.00 * Hand a $1 bill.  Current total: $15.00 * $5 mark hit.  Increase denomination. * Hand a $5 bill.  Current total: $20.00 * Received value reached.  Terminate.   ----  This all changed when calculators and cash registers were introduced.  While the above was useful for an uneducated and unassisted clerk, it was slow.  Now we have the Calculating Machine which will immediately tell you how much money is owed.  The task of the clerk is not to ensure correct change, but to dispense it.  We now have a different problem: what selection of coins and bills will give the correct change, using the fewest number of coins a bills?  For this, the greedy algorithm of \"Give the biggest one you can, for as long as you can\" is optimal.^*  So for the same transaction, we now have the information \"The change from $20 for a bill of $11.23 is $8.77\".  We could still use the above, but it is time consuming in an era where everything is intended to be fast and efficient.  So now, we grab the biggest bills we can:  * Needed: $8.77 worth of change. * Largest possible bill of lesser or equal value: $5. * Give a $5 bill.  $3.77 worth of change remains. * Largest possible bill of lesser or equal value: $1. * Give a $1 bill.  $2.77 worth of change remains. * Largest possible bill of lesser or equal value: $1. * Give a $1 bill.  $1.77 worth of change remains. * Largest possible bill of lesser or equal value: $1. * Give a $1 bill.  $.77 worth of change remains. * Largest possible coin of lesser or equal value: $0.25.

It does point out, however, that the clerk is primed for thinking of your currency in a decreasing-value context.  The bills go first, because they only seconds ago performed a bills-first algorithm to count down your change.  A more attentive clerk may give another second's thought to the order in which they hand you your change.

However, if it were a part of our language to say coins first and then bills, as in \"50.6$\" (meaning 50 cents and 6 dollars), then it would make more sense to me to give coins first and bills second, in order to have clear communication.",

Even when there's no wind, it helps customers keep from dropping their bills, because not everyone grasps their change before moving their hand.  If you worked a drive-thru window and applied both methods to practice as I and many people have done, you would find that coins on top of the bill results in less money being accidentally dropped by customers. There's no need to theorize which way is better when it can, and has, been rigorously applied in practice. That is probably why it seems to be ubiquitous. By the repetitive nature of their jobs, cashiers are fantastic at figuring out the most efficient way to do something, and they have experienced better outcomes by putting the coins on top.",

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: Cultural appropriation is actually a good thing. I personally have learned and been inspired by many people of different cultures.  My honest opinion is  \"Cultural appropriation\"  is a product of progress, or progress is the product of cultural appropriation. Whichever comes first, I find it hard to believe they are not connected. I come from an insular town called Vidor, Texas. We are unfortunately  known for being super white and racist. In my friend group, I am now the minority. I wouldn't have been able to get from a family of confederate sympathizers, to the amazing relationships I have without several forms of cultural appropriation. I can't imagine how a world where more people remain segregated is better for anyone.\n\nAssistant:": {

For example, there was some pic of someone on Tumblr saying using certain emoticons is cultural appropriation.  If you disregard this stupid stuff, you get into better things. For example, white musicians covering black music without giving credit -- and achieving prominence when the original did not -- is a thing.  Personally, I don't like the term, because it is too vague and invites misinterpretation. The above could be better called plagiarism.  Anyways, if you look at some things that people call cultural appropriation that are obviously wrong for other reasons -- like perpetuating ignorant stereotypes -- that's a did starting point for seeing where the boundaries might lie.

            " As others have pointed out, cultural appropriation is a broad thing. For example, a white person making sushi is totally chill. Make food that makes you happy. On the other hand, dressing up as a Native American on Halloween is less chill. That turns a culture into a costume, which is insensitive to many.  Remember that woman Rachel Dolezal who it turns out was more or less pretending to be black? That's also a form of cultural appropriation, a particularly egregious one.  Cultural appropriation is a broad thing, and cultural appropriation that crosses the line will be different to different people. Don't be afraid to learn from other cultures and appreciate what they have to offer. At the same time, do it in a respectful way. If a person who belongs to that culture explains that something you or someone else did made them uncomfortable, take a step back and think about why that might have been.  TL;DR - Cultural appropriation is too broad a thing to be inherently good or bad. Some of it is just fine, and some of it is bad. The key is learning to tell the difference, and to treat cultures with respect.",

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: If you opt out of organ donation, you should be ineligible to receive an organ. As of right now, most places have an \"opt in\" policy for organ donation. You have to manually sign up for organ donation. Most people are lazy or don't think about it, so they never get around to it. That in itself is just lazyness, and I don't think someone should be denied life-saving organs because they never got around to signing something.  However, the news recently has talked about a program which puts you in a \"I don't object\" status - meaning they're going to use your organs for donation by default. If you'd like you can opt out of this, meaning they won't use your organs.   Which is fine, it's literally your body, you can do what you want with it. However, if you're against your organs going to other people, you certainly don't deserve anyone else's organs. \"We can use yours, but not mine\" is incredibly selfish and we and a society shouldn't float that way of thinking.   Obviously this wouldn't apply to minors or people legally incapable of making decisions. And obviously its dumb to throw organs away if there is a need for them, but you should be at the absolute end of the list (and thus you'll never get the transplant because of the backlog)   _____  > *Hello, users of CMV!

Ultimately, the decision is always going to be that of your next of kin, because they are the owners of your body after you die and you have no claims to anything any more.  All you are doing by \"opting out\" is telling them that you would prefer not to donate. You could have any number of reasons for this, including religious reasons protected by Freedom of Religion.

            " The current situation is that organs are assigned based on purely clinical criteria. That is: what is the likely outcome for the patient without the transplant and what is the likely outcome with the transplant.  This seems to me to be the correct way to choose.  How would you choose between the following potential organ recipients:  * patient-A:\ta registered donor. Has a slowly degenerative disease and will live for about ten years without a transplant.  * patient-B:\ta non-donor. Will die within a month without a transplant.  * patient-C:\ta registered donor.

For instance, Austria does have an opt-out system and currently reaches a consent rate of 99.98%. So it could well be that this already covers all the lungs, pancreas or spleens that the country could ever need for transplants.  I could probably agree that patients who don't opt out should be *prioritized* over those who do, but I think it would still be more moral to not deny someone a transplant on principle, just because you can. This would essentially let organs go to waste that could have been used to help people who just happened to have made a mistake (by opting out).  You also have to think about the psychological effects on health professionals. Imagine being a doctor, who is required by law to go to a patient and tell them that although there are plenty of suitable lungs available that could be used to save the patient, they are not allowed to use them, and instead have to let them go to waste, because of some badly informed decision the patient made when they were young. I would find this very inhumane.",

But the people who do it have a wide variety of reasons to do so:  - they believe women should be subjugated, below and reliant on men, and the easiest and historically incredibly effective way to do this is to have them have children   - they believe a womans only contribution should be childcare and caring for their partner, they might point to religious doctrine or just their own feelings for the matter   - they are attempting to be utilitarian, believing that a steady population is a citizens duty and thus women should be having 2 children each to keep the economy stable and the most people happy   - they are part of a religion that decrees women need to have as many children as possible, women not doing this are sinful   - they don\u2019t see woman as full fledged people and cannot understand how they would feel fulfilled without children as they see it as their one purpose, they think they are genuinly being kind in pressuring them",

Try to think of it as deconstruction archaic societal expectations for women. Women should be allowed to have enough agency to personally decide not to procreate or even date late into their adulthood. This was unsightly but mostly acceptable for men to do, but women are actively barraged with criticism for failing to meet this expectation.   There will still be plenty of women who want to marry and have children, but that desire should be the result of your autonomy. Women deserve to have full autonomy; they should be able to make decisions for themselves without feeling obliged to meet societal criteria specific to their gender. They deserve to remain childless, unmarried, and just chill until they're 40 or 50 if that's what they truly want to do.   They deserve to have enough agency to regret not doing it sooner if they come to feel that way."

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: Workers should not be pressured to go back to the office after \u201cvax\u201d and mask mandates are lifted. Remote jobs are the future. Indeed, we were all rushed into the pandemic\u2019s side effects. Personally, I almost didn\u2019t notice how much had changed because as an artist, I spent most of my time working in isolation without any interactions unless prompted to by a colleague to collaborate or speak at a talk. But for most people who are active employees of an organization, who move from their homes everyday to engage in a work environment to earn their living, it was a crucial change. Everyone was given a \u201cmental and physical break\u201d from work, for the most part. Work now became virtual, as that was the only way to avoid contact and interact with like-minded individuals or colleagues to achieve specific goals. Everything and anything was done virtually using team collaboration and aided apps. At the rate the world we live in is moving and the rapid frequency of change, it is almost possible that we will all be required to work \u201conline\u201d together to create work and be productive. We have acquired that experience automatically. Our entire lives, money and services and even products now exist in the \u201cmeta verse\u201d. With the vax and mask mandates being gradually removed there is no way employers should force individuals to work from the office when there are many ways to collaborate and work on projects virtually.

            " I can only speak to my own experience on this. I work as an accountant for a small local government. There is a lot of paper, manual signatures and physical storage of records. And because our small number of offices are so close to each other, there wasn't much pressure prior to COVID and work from home orders to invest in the sorts of accounting and procurement software that would handle remote work or widely disbursed offices.  Our IT team did a fantastic job of cobbling together servers and software to get us access from home, but it wasn't perfect. And many of us looked forward to coming in a couple days a week to handle some of the tasks that were horrendous to complete at home. And we all starting increasing the number of days on our own because it is just easier.  Should we upgrade our software? Absolutely. As a rural community, it would help recruit accountants who don't want to commute everyday. We wouldn't be constantly short staffed. The rest of our team would also benefit.  But changes to accounting software are not instantaneous. A purchase of that magnitude for a government body would take months. Testing would take at least six months to a year since the people working the new system as a test would also need to complete their regular duties in the old system. And then we would need to train the rest of the accounting staff prior to the switch.  And that all comes after funding for this huge purchase is found. Maybe there is a state or federal grant available for this purchase. That takes time for an application and review process. We can't just stop services to the community to pay for this.  All of this takes time. And I definitely am not going to go back to full time teleworking with our makeshift solution to wait out a replacement that could take well over a year to implement. I'll welcome it when it arrives, but I'll do so from the office.",

Say that someone promises that they're going to decrease unemployment by a certain amount; that will rarely be guaranteed and it won't necessarily be the candidate's fault. Take this pandemic for an example, no one could succeed with decreasing unemployment during this time and therefore the people that promised something like that prior to the pandemic cannot be held liable. Politics are just way too complex to start punishing people for that.  But, like in Sweden, I think it's fully reasonable to have a vote if the campaign promises have been directly contradicted. Let's say that a politician says that they are against immigration and then immediately begins taking actions to increase immigration radically. That's going to mean that they've betrayed their election promises entirely and have essentially tried to con the population, and therefore they can be voted out.  As for lying about history or anything like that, I definitely think that there should be more accountability for politicians to be valid sources rather than just saying something to fit their narrative. They need something to back up their claims just like news articles are supposed to have their sources. That being said, it's going to be hard to implement something like this due to the fact that it's difficult to find someone at fault. Did they have sources? Yes. Were they valid? No. It's hard to be able to judge someone else's source criticism, and the only ones who are judged on that level are people within academics, where the requirements are based on the fact that the students have been educated within source criticism.

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: The US should drop the penny from circulation I see no reason for the U.S. to continue make pennys anymore.   They cost more to make than they are worth, 1.67 cents in 2014, 2.41 cents in 2011. The last time a penny cost less than a penny to make was 2005ish.   Abraham Lincoln will be ok, he's got the $5 bill.   There are pretty useless, some places don't accept pennies as payment and there's not much that you could purchase with several pennies.   Other countries are doing it and the U.S. has pulled other denominations from circulation in the past.   It seems much easier to round everything to the nearest 0 or 5 cent than continue to waste money/resources on producing pennies that many Americans don't use. I'm open to either rounding everything up or everything down too.   The cost to make all ~92 billion pennies since 2000 could be put to much better use than making worthless pennies.   What am I missing, is there some reason to keep pennies around?     _____  > *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

It isn't inherently a problem if currency costs more than its face value. Each unit of currency will facilitate many many transactions in its lifetime, creating a much more value than they ever cost to make. Cheaper is obviously better, but most denominations would still be worth producing even if they were a lot more expensive.  Which is not to say that the penny is useful enough to justify its cost. It's value is so low that there are very few transactions these days that truly benefit from its presence. My point is just that there's nothing special about them costing more than 1 cent.",

            " There's really no argument for keeping the penny, neither in the U.S. nor anywhere else. However, it's probably more convenient to keep them, and this is the sort of thing people get very emotional about and it's hardly worth the hassle. They're so useless it's not even worth it getting rid of them.",
            " The U.S. has at least one somewhat unusual facet that makes this more difficult than other countries: we require that sales tax not be included in prices.  This means that we will *always* end up with prices that come out to uneven amounts.  Of course, one might argue that the price can be rounded to the nearest nickel, but there are various abuses that are hard to prevent with such a scheme.

Each unit of currency will facilitate many many transactions in its lifetime, creating a much more value than they ever cost to make. Cheaper is obviously better, but most denominations would still be worth producing even if they were a lot more expensive.  Which is not to say that the penny is useful enough to justify its cost. It's value is so low that there are very few transactions these days that truly benefit from its presence. My point is just that there's nothing special about them costing more than 1 cent.",

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: there are only two genders, and it is not transphobic to say so Small proviso to start with. Gender is primarily a social construct (see note at the bottom for those who disagree), and as such is defined by your society and culture. There are a handful of cultures that do traditionally have third genders, and if you were raised in one of these, then I am highly likely to accept your exotic gender identity.  &#x200B;  The following genders exist:  * men/boys * women/girls  &#x200B;  Other things commonly asserted as genders are not genders.  * **transgender:** Transgender people exist, but \"transgender\" is not itself a gender. They were one of the above two genders, and now they're the other one. * **agender:** To assert \"I have no gender; I am agender; agender is a gender\" is a logical contradiction. I said that there are two genders, but I didn't say that everybody belongs to one of them. There are two genders, and you can belong to neither. (\"Irreligious\" is not a religion.) * **bigender:** A similar counting argument can be given. \"I have two genders; I am a man and a woman; I am bigender\" implies logically that bigender cannot be a gender. As per agender, I didn't say that everybody belongs to exactly one gender. There are two genders, and you can belong to both. * **gender-fluid:** I don't doubt that gender-fluid people exist; I know some. The Earth has a northern hemisphere and a southern hemisphere. The fact that some people want or need to travel between the hemispheres occasionally doesn't create a new hemisphere. * **intersex:** You are confusing biological sex with gender. * **demigender:** This is usually a term which encompasses one or both of bigender or gender-fluid, but with a skew towards either man or woman. For example, someone who identifies with both genders but is mostly a man, or someone who alternates between both genders, but mostly a woman. As such, the same arguments apply.  &#x200B;  In general, apart from the two genders I listed at the top, the other categories that people sometimes assert to be genders may be valid categories of people who exist, but that doesn't mean they are genders.  To further illustrate my point, if someone were insistent that their gender was Canadian, and it seemed important to them or they provided evidence of it, then I would certainly accept that they were Canadian, and might even pay lip service to accepting their Canadian gender, especially if they were a nice person (which most Canadians are), but I doubt I would truly be convinced that Canadian was actually a gender.  &#x200B;  \\[ Note for those who think gender is defined biologically rather than socially \u2014 when you are talking about someone and don't know whether to address them as \"he\" or \"she\", how often do you pull down their pants to check? How often do you sequence their DNA to check? Or do you, like the rest of us, rely mostly on their style of dress, hair cut, and other non-biological cues? \\]\n\nAssistant:": {

            " If you acknowledge gender is a social construct, why are you set against there being more than two genders?

For whatever reason, maybe they were more open minded or simply had a higher rate of occurance, those cultures acknowledged gender being more than a binary. Either that or the closest thing we can ascribe their views is our concept of gender even if it doesn't fit all that well. As a culture's knowledge and needs change and just natural evolution of culture in a world exposed to different ideas, points of views and facts, their commonly held views and leanguage changes. New words are created and old words are given new meaning. The ideas behind those words changed as well.  So now as more people are aware of trans people, non binary, etc. the culture changes as it always has and always will. These people are not being erased and hidden anymore. Those that would normally never come out suddenly feel more comfortable in identifying in something other than a traditional male or female. A need arises to define what that is because current labels feel inadequate and for better or worse, people often need adequate labels to feel complete or ground themselves in a group.  This is brand new territory and terms new terms will be created, old terms will be discarded and others redefined. Its always happened and the clearest example of that is slang where something like bad can mean good when it is not its traditional meaning.  As people are free to not define themselves in a strict binary and explore what that means and how they truly feel, man and woman may be redefined and even discarded at some point in the future. It all depends on what people end up needing and how our culture evolves and how we see these social constructs.",

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: Travelling is a vastly overrated pastime, I wish my generation did not venerate this activity so bloody much I will start by saying I have travelled to over 30 countries across Europe, North America, East Asia, South East Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. I live in a country I was not born in, and hope to eventually die here too. My parents, sibling, relatives, friends, acquiescences and work colleagues all place immense value in travelling to as many countries as they can, before they become infirm and too old to fly by plane. Their FB and IG feeds attests to this. Out of loyalty to my relatives and friends, I go with them on holiday abroad every year, or even twice. Often a new country, sometimes a destination of my choosing. The truth is, and I will never admit to them, I absolutely despise going on holiday, and I'm deeply suspicious of people who make their love of travel, a central part of their personality.  When I'm reminded of a holiday I have undertaken, triggered by a conversation topic or seeing an old photo, no emotions of the places are elicited in me whatsoever. Except perhaps the reminder of the frustrations that inevitably come with travelling by plane. The Sagrada Familia is just a fancy looking church to me. The Angkor Wat felt so much smaller, and less significant up close than when I read about it. San Francisco wasn't overrun by pissing and shitting vagabonds, as Reddit would like me to believe, but the city's charm was largely lost on me. I'm no foodie, eating \"authentic\" cuisines means little to me, sushi in Japan was certainly better than anywhere I can find in London, but I don't pine for it. Pizzas, pastas and gelato weren't even better in Italy, just different.  My positive memories aren't things I've seen, eaten, walked through, explored, touched or smelt. My positive memories abroad almost always involved the people I travel with and care about. I already get their company back at home. And little actually to do with where I am. When left on my own devices, I much prefer to stay in my hotel room drinking tea and reading my kindle.  When I do ask people why they love to travel so much, I only get the same cliche answers: the food, the sights, the climate, immersing oneself in a foreign culture (this last one can come across patronising, in honesty). When I ask them if they learnt anything from the experience, or had it changed them for the better, I get even less convincing answers, if any. \"To broaden my horizons\" is one, but the fact you went in the first place already suggests you were well up for opening your minds anyway.  I do not imply that people who enjoy travelling are boring. No. But too many people I've met certainly put this front and centre as their most interesting attribute, naming all the cities they visited as some sort of accomplishment. \"I love to travel\" tells me as much about someone who says they watch Netflix, play video-games, loves walking and listening to music.  I can already anticipate some of the replies: I honestly don't think I'm (too) boring, I have so many different hobbies and varied interests, I don't have all the time in the world to fully invest myself in each. I'm not so closed minded of different cultures, I live and enjoy working in one of the most multicultural cities in the world, and teaching myself to speak two languages. I find it easy to find something in almost anyone interesting, and worth talking about. I can hold a conversation about them, until we both exhaust ourselves. But if they want to just talk about their gap-year backpacking trip to Thailand, I simply cannot relate to them on an emotional level. That subject, and cars, are probably the only two I cannot maintain much enthusiasm in.    I wasn't sure where I wanted to put this post, could have been /r/unpopularopinion, /r/rant, or /r/offmychests. But I decided to post here, because I honestly would like to understand why you might enjoy it so much? What is it about it that excites you, the subject makes me feel like an alien. I do feel an little bad about myself for not enjoying something most intelligent and well-rounded people would.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " While this may not be exactly a view change, let me shed some light on a different perspective. I grew ups in the \"flyover states\" out west in the USA. The majority of the people I went to school with are still in those towns, they may have left the state once or twice in their lives, but by no means is it a regular occurrence.  Being that my family valued new experiences more than things, I traveled a lot around the US growing up. The older I got, the more I realize a lot of my views and opinions were so different compared to my classmates because of exposure to things.  So to get into your question, for me love of travel is a symptom, not the 'disease'. I love learning, that usually manifests in the form of new experiences. Those experiences are new more often than not because they were not available where I was before. That being said, I'm just as likely to find them meeting interesting people, taking a class, learning a new skill, etc...  I get where you're coming from, I wasn't impressed visiting NYC, was more interested in reading than sightseeing when we rented an RV in Alaska, and in general a lot of road trips have just kinda blurred together.  But on the other hand some of the most interesting experience I've had have been far away from home.

            " Seems like you just don't enjoy it. I love travel and am completely bored out of my mind shopping for clothes, maybe you're the opposite. It doesn't necessarily devalue either activity.  For me at least travel is a mixture of escapism, getting out of your comfort zone and of course seeing new and interesting things. My life at home (while great on the whole) is piled up with things that occasionally stress me like relationships, work and uni. I'm often so 'comfy' in my comfort zone that I'll spend entire weeks doing the same things over and over again. Travel (and for me that's generally longish-term backpacking) allows me to let my hair down so to speak and actually remember what makes life so great. I've got no responsibilities and exist almost entirely outside my 'comfort zone' so I just feel so much more free and it allows me to really enjoy life to the fullest. Meeting new people, seeing different cultures, seeing varied nature etc are all incredibly enjoyable activities to me. In saying that I do agree with you that long-term I do become sick of just seeing another church/castle (or their equivalent). But I don't generally feel that about talking to new people or hiking through different landscapes. Of course you might though and that's fair enough.   Going outside my own feelings it is interesting how travel is seen as something 'above' other hobbies. I don't personally see why it should but I think it's obvious why it is so. Getting on a plane and going somewhere for a couple of weeks (or more) is obviously more of an event than going down to your local rock-climbing gym once a week. It's also an activity that a much bigger population enjoys which obviously brings it to the fore. Finally as you say yourself generally I find (and I admit I'm a little biased here) it's the more well-rounded/interesting people that go travelling. It's hardly surprising that society venerates an activity that all the 'cool' people go on.",
            " There's no particular reason for you to pretend to enjoy something you don't. One of the joys of adulthood is that you can stop liking things just because they're trendy. For example, I don't like watching sports. I find them super boring to watch. I've really enjoyed going to games in person on a handful of occasions, though there--as with you and traveling--it's about the company rather than the activity.    And yet, watching some kind of organized sport is maybe the most popular recreational activity in the world.   But would I say it's \"overrated?\" Not... *really.* I mean, I don't like to do it. But \"overrated\" seems like such an odd way to describe that. Watching sports is just... not for me. That doesn't mean that *other* people should *also* be less excited than they are. At least, it doesn't mean that necessarily. I'm sure other people have perfectly honest reasons to love watching soccer.   That seems similar to your relationship with traveling. You've done it. It's not for you. It sounds like you've visited all sorts of places. I'm sure you've tried all sorts of vacations, too--adenturey, outdoorsy, urban, relaxing, cultural, foodie, etc.   So the next time someone invites you on a big trip, save yourself some money, put your feet up, and crack open that kindle instead.   But also don't waste time worrying that other people like something \"too much.\" I don't do it much, but I like to travel. And there's no secret that you aren't in on, I'm afraid. People really mean it when they say it's all about the food and the sights and the cultural immersion. I'm a person who has a strong \"sense of place.\" Being in a meaningful or unique place is really, really pleasurable for me. That's all there is to it! Nothing more special than that. When I think about happy memories, I think about *where* they happened as much as about *who* I was with. I think about the way the little bar in Tokyo smelled like cedar, and the sound of the train from outside, and the American funk music they were playing inside, and the way the food tasted, and the way the coins felt in my pocket, and how quiet it was outside when we left. And all of that is part of what makes that memory happy to me.   You don't seem to have that. No biggie!",

            " I HATE travelling, I'm glad I'm not the only one! Everyone at my college worships studying abroad and takes all of these pictures just to show off to instagram lol. I always said I feel like the hassle of travelling outweighs the fun of it. I hate going through airports and dealing with tickets, passports, and hotels.

        "rejected_target": " While this may not be exactly a view change, let me shed some light on a different perspective. I grew ups in the \"flyover states\" out west in the USA. The majority of the people I went to school with are still in those towns, they may have left the state once or twice in their lives, but by no means is it a regular occurrence.  Being that my family valued new experiences more than things, I traveled a lot around the US growing up. The older I got, the more I realize a lot of my views and opinions were so different compared to my classmates because of exposure to things.  So to get into your question, for me love of travel is a symptom, not the 'disease'. I love learning, that usually manifests in the form of new experiences. Those experiences are new more often than not because they were not available where I was before. That being said, I'm just as likely to find them meeting interesting people, taking a class, learning a new skill, etc...  I get where you're coming from, I wasn't impressed visiting NYC, was more interested in reading than sightseeing when we rented an RV in Alaska, and in general a lot of road trips have just kinda blurred together.  But on the other hand some of the most interesting experience I've had have been far away from home. Scuba diving at night on a reef with sharks, helping survey bats while being shown what their echolocation actually sounds like, discovering I had knack for photography at an offroad competition, fishing at 2 in the morning while the sun was still up in Alaska... Those are things I wouldn't have found or experienced at home."

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: A creator should not be able to file a DMCA take down for content because they disapprove of the person making the content. News story happening today - YouTuber/streamer PewDiePie says racist word on stream.  Creator of Firewatch tweeted shortly after that he planned to file a DMCA take down for all PewDiePie videos using his content.  Since this probably needs to be said, firstly.. I'm not defending PewDiePie or what he said. This is a CMV about Fair Use and DMCA, not racism or PewDiePie.   -----  The YouTube creator profits from content made using (via fair use) another person's content. I don't even think explicit permission is needed for this, but Firewatch gave blanket permission for anyone to use their game to make content.  The original content creator decides they do not like the YT creator for whatever reason. Do they have the right to selectively file DMCA take downs against people they do not like personally? What if that person says or does something the original creator morally objects to?   I think the obvious answer here is 100% no. I think in this case a lot of people might disagree solely because they agree with the moral objection.   Ultimately the original creator does not like an opinion/action of the YT creator. If the Firewatch creator could successfully take down in this case, any game dev would be able to DMCA take down content due to negative reviews of their game.    _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things. Firstly, please* ***read through our rules***. *If you see a comment that has broken one, it is more effective to report it than downvote it.

            " So, copyright law and fair use in particular is kind of my area, so this should be fun.  >The original content creator decides they do not like the YT creator for whatever reason. Do they have the right to selectively file DMCA take downs against people they do not like personally?  Generally, yes, as long as they could have filed a takedown notice to begin with.  You're getting hung up on two separate issues here.  The first is the question of whether the takedown is valid generally, the second is selective enforcement of copyright based on personal objections or morality.  So let's first deal with the validity of the takedown generally.  (1).  Can Let's Plays be Taken Down Generally?  The answer is murky mostly because copyright law hasn't really dealt with the copyright status of \"original work plus commentary which still presents the entire original work in full.\"  There's a lot of interesting stuff to get into with \"transformation\" of the work and *Campbell*, which I would go into but we'd be here all day.  But the general question is whether the new work \"supplants\" the original work, or is a wholly new work.  The easy example is that you don't read a review of a movie in the New York Times in lieu of seeing the movie.  It can influence your decision, but fundamentally what you get out of the review isn't the same thing as you'd get out of the movie proper.  This is stuff long-established in case law (*see e.g. Gaylord v. United States*, *Worldwide Church of God v. Philadelphia Church or God*, and *Infinity Broadcast v. Kirkwood*).  And there's a pretty easy distinction to make between \"can access part of the original and all of the commentary\" and \"can access all of the original and all of the commentary.\"  So if we accept that the purpose of a video game like Firewatch is to receive as a piece of narrative storytelling, the addition of a particular person playing and giving commentary doesn't change that.  And we'd arrive at it being a \"derivative work\" rather than fair use.  *Cariou* makes a mess of things, I don't want to get into that but under that standard one could make an argument that all playthroughs are fair use, but *Cariou* also represents a circuit split and will need to go up to the Supreme Court to hash it out.  So let's assume that the take-down of playthroughs *generally* is valid (as it would likely be if we ignore *Cariou*).  (2).  Can An Author Issue Take Downs Arbitrarily and Selectively?  Yes, 100%.  In the same way that they can license work selectively, and only give permission to some people to make merchandise, or others to make translations.  If let's play videos are fair use, it doesn't matter.  If they're *not* fair use, the original creator can license, and revoke the licensure of, whoever he wants.  >If the Firewatch creator could successfully take down in this case, any game dev would be able to DMCA take down content due to negative reviews of their game.  Well, no.  Like I said at the beginning, regardless of the Circuit you buy into there is a clear protection for *reviews*.  A let's-play video is arguably (and I'd say likely) something very different.",

            " You are mixing a lot of things up together. This issue is as you said there is an open and free allowance for people to make content off their games. They can not revoke that permission retroactively. They can say he can't make future content but his old content should be safe in the long term. Whether the content is fair use or not has little relevance in DMCA strikes.   Now if they should stand or not is another matter entirely. What will likely happen is if they try to pull them from youtube and Felix disputes it the devs have to take it to court if they want it to stay down. If the devs fail this then in one month the videos will be back with nothing changing. It's not likely the case will go to court as the devs did provide open and free permission to make content.   The case has to go to court if neither side backs down as that is the only way to dispute legal issues."

            " The African-American community has been losing our share of the American economy since the enactment of the Civil Rights act due to Black people shopping at white owned businesses and not vice-versa. Every community needs to support their local and communal business owners in order to stimulate the community wealth. Why do we put \"Made in America,\" on products? It increases our GDP to do business intracommunally. Black Americans are the only group held to the standard of not supporting each other's businesses. White people bounce their dollar (spend their money with another white person) about 7x before it exits their community. Chinese people spend their money (allegedly) more than 10x before it exits their community (explaining their explosive economic growth), Latin Americans spend their money (I actually forget the number, but it was close to the Chinese rate of internal spending). African-Americans are averaging...guess how many times? Less than 1.   That means, while African-Americans are as rich as the nation of Spain, we also are rapidly generating wealth that we do not hold. The fastest way to increase our wealth as a community is building an internal economy, so advertising things as \"Black owned,\" tells us, in this country where we are the least likely group of people for OTHERS to spend money with us, but the most likely group of people to spend money in other communities, that THIS BUSINESS MAY BENEFIT YOU. We could theoretically end up the second richest group of people in the world through this. Instead we are going broke, estimated to hit an average of $0 net worth by mid-century, all for doing business with white people. Lol. Terrible.",

            " You said it means nothing but then said it does impact your decisions. So we have to separate it into whether it means something at all or in the 'grand scheme'. There are two ways I would say you are wrong. 1 - it matters on a small level, 2 - it matters in the grand scheme.  1. It does make a difference to people's spending habits, obviously, at least on the small pragmatic scale. That is reason enough to do it if it is true and it has an overall beneficial outcome. 2. It means a lot on the grand scheme. Not sure how you intend that to be interpreted but I'm pretty sure any macro analysis of gender and wealth in society would show a significant underrepresentation of black wealthy business owners. There was an idea a while ago that the best approach to racial issues is to be race blind, I would guess that you would like to be of this school of thought. This is not the prevalent belief anymore, it seems clear now that race is actually impossible to ignore. And its effects on large social trends and interactions are unavoidable. Thus taking a race blind approach really just allows underlying biases to remain and continue their influence. So the better approach is to recognize biases and work to circumvent them. One observation is that black communities hold a disproportionate amount of ownership than their population and spending would suggest. That is an important metric for many reasons. You battle that the same way people talk about 'supporting local business'. Thus, 'black owned' is an important signal and an important way of battling a very large macro social-economic trend.",
            " This is a very easy CMV to simply Google and it's a valid question. The Brookings institute did a large study on it and basically found that once you control for industry, minority and white owned businesses achieved the same ratings. So in terms of your point about black owned businesses being inferior, that is simply not supported on an aggregate level by the data. I skimmed the 24 page report but it sounds like in black neighborhoods getting Yelp reviews at least is more difficult than in more predominantly white neighborhoods.

You battle that the same way people talk about 'supporting local business'. Thus, 'black owned' is an important signal and an important way of battling a very large macro social-economic trend."

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: Democracy in its current format does not support long term improvements Given that elections happen every 4 years, parties are incentivised to make short term improvements that may be at a long term detriment in order to win votes and stay in power. Also on this, any long term benefits seem to get mopped up by the next party in power who take the credit for it. (trump taking credit for some of obamas changes as an example)  The other side is i was also reading a book recently where the countries with the biggest growth /improvements were actually aurhoritarian/dictatorships which surprised me. For record I don't agree with the authoritarian approach to government but it seems like the main benefit to this is that they can push quite extensive reform quickly and stick to it.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " This is a major topic in political philosophy.   In principle we could fit every government on a spectrum going from: the rule of the one (monarchy, dictatorship) to the rule of the few (aristocracy, oligarchy, elective aristocracy), and finally the rule of the people (democracy).   What we observe is that the most \"effective\" form of government is the rule of the one, things get done in a dictatorship. However it comes with significant downsides, most notably the whole \"absolute power corrupts absolutely\" thing, but also the fact that the ruler has his own inherrent biases and preconceived ideas on certain topics and they may affect the course of the nation unchallenged.  Next if we consider the absolute democracy, where every voter can vote on every issue, well it used to be unthinkable for anything beyond a small village. These days it might be achievable through technology. However, for a voter to make an informed decision on every issue, it would take a significant amount of time out of the average citizen. It is already hard enough to do so every X years for an election. This could never become an everyday thing, you would end up doing the job of a congressman on top of your actual job.   This is where we need to reach a compromise. We could vote for a king, but the dangers mentionned above remain, also the vision for the nation would be susceptible to a complete 180 every election cycle.  That's why, most democratic governement today implement a form of government which Is intended as an \"elective aristocracy\". The intent is to have everyone vote to decide who \"the best people to govern\" are, and have them make everyday decision in our stead for a set period of time. Since the whole government does not change at once, it retains the ability to work towards a shared vision.   This is where we reach your CMV.

While I agree with you that the system in the US is rotten, and that it might very well spread to other nations fast, I will attempt to shift the blame from the model of government as a whole to a more targeted cog in the system if you will.  Normally, if the people we elected turn out not to be the best people to govern, we could simply vote them out and make a better, more informed choice next time right? It is an effective feedback loop.  In principle yes but that is dependant on a few factors. Most importantly:  1. The people need to be made aware of the failings of the leaders. Imagine a corrupt senator, as long as the people do not know about his corruption, they can't act on it. It would be obvious in a small town, but a major nation? You need an inquisitive and free press that the people can trust to relay the information to the people so the feedback loop is complete. If the press is corrupted by the powers that be, or if there is much contradicting information everywhere, the people will not be able to obtain or recognize the truth and the feedback loop is broken.   2. The population need to be educated enough to be able to render reasonable decisions every election cycle, and now additionally weed through a bunch of disinformation.

Not really. They like to project that image to the world, but in practice they rarely follow through on such promises. Or do so, but in a limited manner that only ends up helping their own elites. Ex. They might announce a huge new program to rebuild all the roads and start with the roads that service the factories and ports owned by elites\u2014but mysteriously the money and will to finish vanish before it ever result in a road servicing the slums in order to afford newer priorities.  To put it another way: the government that can suddenly decide to manifest a new city into being can also suddenly decide to redirect those resources elsewhere when it no longer wants a city there.  There\u2019s a fairly sizable industry involved in what amounts to authoritarian propaganda though. They produce a lot of content to make it seem like they\u2019re doing all this stuff very well, but when you dig into it they tend not to actually complete much of it. Ex. They build a lot of high speed rail\u2026 between the places that elites want people to go. They never seem to get around to the high speed rail between places poor people want to go.",

            " It's not surprising that authoritarian governments CAN achieve higher economic growth rates, when they can do what they want and don't need to worry about pleasing voters, getting voted out, etc. The problem is that if whoever is in power doesn't want to improve things or isn't very good at it, you're stuck with them.  But I know you're not saying that authoritarian government is better. Just that \"Democracy in its current format does not support long term improvements\". Well I'd say this is wrong, because look at the evidence. Democracy as we know it has been the most common form of government in developed countries since at least the early to mid 20th century. Since the start of the 20th Century, which countries would you say have had a bigger improvement in living conditions? Those that have democratic governments or those that don't?",
            " >Given that elections happen every 4 years, parties are incentivised to make short term improvements that may be at a long term detriment in order to win votes and stay in power.  Seems like you are talking about the US presidential elections, so I'll use US examples.   Elections happen both more often and less often than that. The house is every two years, the president every four, and Senate every six (though it's not all of it at the same time). So there is incremental updating to the government. So for example, in 2022, the president will stay the same, the house will be mixed up, and some, but not all  (34 to be exact), of the senate will change as well.   Further, the way the US system works now, to be honest, it's arguable much if not most of the actual governing doesn't happen by congress & the president, but by unelected agencies in the \"administrative state.\" There is great debate over whether this is a good thing or not, people on the left tending to say it's good/necessary, people on the right tending to think it's bad/unconstitutional, but either way, there's general agreement that a lot of governing is done by these agencies (e.g., EPA, FTC, FDA, SEC, FCC, etc.).   There are two basic types, independent and executive agencies. Roughly, executive agencies generally have a single head that the president can fire, while independent agencies are led by a group that cannot be directly fired by the president. Either way, these agencies do a lot of governing. They can make laws, have their own internal court systems, and sometimes their own executive systems run entirely by their agencies. There are technical legal rules about how much power they have (e.g., Chevron deference, the non-delegation doctrine, etc.), but suffice it to say they have a lot of power. And, they are not elected. They do tend to have long-term goals and can make policy accordingly. Here's the EPA's current strategic plan cycle.   So, if you are worried congress/the president doesn't have long term focus, maybe look at agencies and how they could be improved to make sure there is a branch of government (sometimes the agencies are called the \"fourth\" branch of government) that does have long-term goals. But there are also arguments that allowing scientists and professionals to run the government is like authoritarianism because they are unelected. While others argue they need to be independent of government precisely so they can have long-term goals.",

            " I think as another poster said below, you should not conflate democracy with the American system. Great topic though.  Perhaps you can edit your title?  Each country has it's own systems for passing laws and America is quite unique.  America's failing can be found at the Senate and filibuster. The system has made it impossible for Democrats to pass anything. The Senate seats are unevenly distributed to Republican areas, as a price of having one nation/ union.  Going into your view though, I would argue that trump (an authentarian) has wasted resources on a wall/ pr stunt. And did not undertake long term views on any matter (eg climate change, infrastructure). And i would argue that the democratic system failed/ was bypassed as he wielded power in an authoritarian manner with executive orders.  Plenty of authoritarian countries struggle too though. Eg North Korea (crippling sanctions play a part of course, but it is a direct result of the authoritarian leadership).  On the other hand, democratic systems flourish too. Denmark, Finland etc.",

Seems like you are talking about the US presidential elections, so I'll use US examples.   Elections happen both more often and less often than that. The house is every two years, the president every four, and Senate every six (though it's not all of it at the same time). So there is incremental updating to the government. So for example, in 2022, the president will stay the same, the house will be mixed up, and some, but not all  (34 to be exact), of the senate will change as well.   Further, the way the US system works now, to be honest, it's arguable much if not most of the actual governing doesn't happen by congress & the president, but by unelected agencies in the \"administrative state.\" There is great debate over whether this is a good thing or not, people on the left tending to say it's good/necessary, people on the right tending to think it's bad/unconstitutional, but either way, there's general agreement that a lot of governing is done by these agencies (e.g., EPA, FTC, FDA, SEC, FCC, etc.).   There are two basic types, independent and executive agencies. Roughly, executive agencies generally have a single head that the president can fire, while independent agencies are led by a group that cannot be directly fired by the president. Either way, these agencies do a lot of governing. They can make laws, have their own internal court systems, and sometimes their own executive systems run entirely by their agencies. There are technical legal rules about how much power they have (e.g., Chevron deference, the non-delegation doctrine, etc.), but suffice it to say they have a lot of power. And, they are not elected. They do tend to have long-term goals and can make policy accordingly. Here's the EPA's current strategic plan cycle.   So, if you are worried congress/the president doesn't have long term focus, maybe look at agencies and how they could be improved to make sure there is a branch of government (sometimes the agencies are called the \"fourth\" branch of government) that does have long-term goals. But there are also arguments that allowing scientists and professionals to run the government is like authoritarianism because they are unelected.

What about funding scientific research that also delivers results that make people's lives better further than 4 years from now. I'd argue that also in this democracies are leading the way, although China is not doing too badly either.   How about education?

        "sft_target": " This is a major topic in political philosophy.   In principle we could fit every government on a spectrum going from: the rule of the one (monarchy, dictatorship) to the rule of the few (aristocracy, oligarchy, elective aristocracy), and finally the rule of the people (democracy).   What we observe is that the most \"effective\" form of government is the rule of the one, things get done in a dictatorship. However it comes with significant downsides, most notably the whole \"absolute power corrupts absolutely\" thing, but also the fact that the ruler has his own inherrent biases and preconceived ideas on certain topics and they may affect the course of the nation unchallenged.  Next if we consider the absolute democracy, where every voter can vote on every issue, well it used to be unthinkable for anything beyond a small village. These days it might be achievable through technology. However, for a voter to make an informed decision on every issue, it would take a significant amount of time out of the average citizen. It is already hard enough to do so every X years for an election. This could never become an everyday thing, you would end up doing the job of a congressman on top of your actual job.   This is where we need to reach a compromise. We could vote for a king, but the dangers mentionned above remain, also the vision for the nation would be susceptible to a complete 180 every election cycle.  That's why, most democratic governement today implement a form of government which Is intended as an \"elective aristocracy\". The intent is to have everyone vote to decide who \"the best people to govern\" are, and have them make everyday decision in our stead for a set period of time. Since the whole government does not change at once, it retains the ability to work towards a shared vision.   This is where we reach your CMV. What are the weaknesses of this form of government and why is it failing today? Is \"democracy\" as it is implemented today to blame?   While I agree with you that the system in the US is rotten, and that it might very well spread to other nations fast, I will attempt to shift the blame from the model of government as a whole to a more targeted cog in the system if you will.  Normally, if the people we elected turn out not to be the best people to govern, we could simply vote them out and make a better, more informed choice next time right? It is an effective feedback loop.  In principle yes but that is dependant on a few factors. Most importantly:  1. The people need to be made aware of the failings of the leaders. Imagine a corrupt senator, as long as the people do not know about his corruption, they can't act on it. It would be obvious in a small town, but a major nation? You need an inquisitive and free press that the people can trust to relay the information to the people so the feedback loop is complete. If the press is corrupted by the powers that be, or if there is much contradicting information everywhere, the people will not be able to obtain or recognize the truth and the feedback loop is broken.   2. The population need to be educated enough to be able to render reasonable decisions every election cycle, and now additionally weed through a bunch of disinformation.    What I'm getting at here is that the model of government we see today is a well thought out compromise, and it was not always this broken. Circonstances changed and now the major challenge facing democracy in the age of information is information itself. Maybe the solution is a change in the model, maybe it is a change in the way information is allowed to spread, or something else entierely.  Hopefully this helped you in your reflexion!",

This peaked with Oblivion, but I honestly didn't feel like FO3, FO4, and Skyrim differed much in how well they did what they were trying to do. Beautiful vistas, exploration, places to go.

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: Modern Art is not \"Real Art\" and using the argument that it's subjective is a poor argument. I'm talking about art like simply a random latrine, random globs/strokes of paint, a cup of water being placed on the floor, etc.  The argument for modern art seems to be two-fold, one art is subjective and thus anything can be art as long as I believe it is. And two trying to define what is and isn't art or trying to put a label on it is too constrictive and squashes any changes in innovation and art style.  My first point I'd like to bring up is a misunderstanding of the definition of subjective, contrary to popular belief it isn't synonymous with opinion. All Opinions are Subjective, but not everything that is subjective is based on opinion.  What is Subjective can indeed be based off one's personal feelings and impressions that however does not mean that subjectivity DOESN'T have form.  Subjective simply means the impression of an object is based on the frame of reference and impression on the subject, and thus it may not be the same as another person.  If I witness the same event as another person. My recall of the event is Subjectively different than the other person, (Even more I attach an interpretation.) HOWEVER it does not mean the scene we did not witness wasn't real and exist outside us.  Basically what I'm saying is while it's true that art can be subjective in HOW we interpret it and what we think of it, the object of the art itself that we are interpreting is an actual object. I would also like to point out even two people's different subjective interpretations may be different and may not 100% fall into Objective reality. That our Subjective interpretations still have a form or mode of reasoning behind them. One can have a system of logic that is consistent and built on reasonable axioms, but these self-system of reasoning can still be divorced from external reality, this is the difference between Philosophy and Science. While both are trying to be consistent and logical in modeling the world, Science is attempting to verify with external observation, that if repeated by different subjects will yield similar results. (Thus is independent of the subjective experience of the observer.)  Thus I submit that simply saying that anything can be art because it's \"subjective\" is like confusing how one views a work, with the work itself. (This get's into debates of course of the author's intent vs the audience.) I also feel that one can have Form and still be Subjective (Since one argument is trying to apply form to something ruins the subjectivity.) Even if something is made to not be photo realistic or give a perfect impression of reality (Like Impressionism) It still has a form, the form is simply a creation from the artist's own impression rather than an imitation of reality. To use an example if there was a theoretical universe with different laws of physics then the ones that governed ours, that universe would have an inherently different form than ours and if it didn't exist only exist in the mind of the subject, in other words it is neither objective nor empirical but it has form. Even many subjective forms might try to imitative objective reality in one way, but choose to ignore or exaggerate certain elements to bring that element of reality to the forefront never the less, it still has form.  To Simply say anything can be art, is too in effect destroy the purpose of having a word, which is too distinguish and identify one idea distinct from another, if everything can be \"art\" what is even art if we cannot compare it against what \"isn't\" art. Even if we try to say \"Some art is more artistic then others\" can we really do that if we don't have something that \"isn't\" art at one end of the scale as a point of zero.  When you literally cannot tell modern art from a random glob of paint on a canvas, I have to ask how does one discriminate what pieces of art are more \"valuable\" than others, what one's we choose to put on display and celebrate, and if art is truly only decided by personal opinion, then how can one truly say how valid one interpretation of art is over another, unless it has some form to compare one's interpretation to.  To go more deeply into the \"defining what is and isn't art\" shuts down creativity. I say this, there is nothing to say that definition cannot change and evolve, or that muliple different \"forms\" cannot be added. However it is another to say that definitions ought to be flexible or that there can be alternate forms, and that there is no definition or forms at all. Without them you lack a language and no way to communicate. Like it or not, definitions primary purpose is not to \"ruin people's fun\" it's so we are all on the same page and can communicate, definitions can change, but the two parities must understand the semantic meaning between the word. (Even if one disagrees with it at least they understand what the other is TRYING to say.)  TL;DR one must not use Subjectivity as an excuse that art should not have form, and one must not confuse the concept of form as a legalistic inflexible system, but as a toolkit to build your own interpretation or style. (Style in of itself is something we try to recognize based on reoccurring elements, patterns, or motifs that mark an individual, group, or system of ideologies presence.) Reality is one form, but one can have a form without it lining up 100% with reality, and there can be many different forms that don't follow the same rules, but they do follow rules, the rules are simply different from subject to subject. (In short rules and forms can be subjective themselves and not simply an interpretation or opinion of the same rules.)\n\nAssistant:": {

            " **You're bringing a knife to a gun fight**. By that I mean you're jumping into a conversation that has been going on for eons without any theoretical background. Because, strangely enough, this conversation has been happening since time immemorial and there are those who would agree with your view. They are those who would destroy it. Where you situate yourself in that conversation, where you position yourself within it, is interesting. But to try to state a position within it, without understanding the conversation, proves that you haven't thought it through.   >Even if something is made to not be photo realistic or give a perfect impression of reality (Like Impressionism) It still has a form, the form is simply a creation from the artist's own impression rather than an imitation of reality ...] Even many subjective forms might try to imitative objective reality in one way, but choose to ignore or exaggerate certain elements to bring that element of reality to the forefront never the less, it still has form.  Here you're cribbing Plato. Well, sort of cribbing Plato, you haven't gone totally bug-nutty on the ideal form of a flower, but you're more or less making his case. There's there's the flower itself, the actual flower, growing in the dirt. Then there's a photo of the flower, a thousand photos of the flower, trying for representation. Then I paint the flower. I try to paint with perfect representation. I won't get perfect, but I attempt for it. Then I can go out into abstractions of the flower (like Monet, like an impressionist). Maybe I paint a cubist flower. The petals are coming out the stem, round shapes are refracted and disordered into rectangular forms, but at the end of the day, I still have a flower. But then I take my cubist painting, hand it to my impressionist friend, and he paints an impressionist form of my painting. Now, we're still painting the flower but we're painting and impressionist rendition of a cubist's rendition of the flower. Is it still a flower? Hmm...maybe. But then I give that painting to my abstract expressionist friend and he draws a big, yellow streak down the canvas, takes a green line and cuts the yellow streak at a diagonal.   And he says, \"Behold! My flower. It is art!\" And you say, \"No, a bridge too far, that's just two fucking lines of paint\".   And many agree.   **It is not about form**. That's where your argument goes off the rails.   Art has form(s). Form doesn't define art. Art is the relationship between sign and signified. If you give an eight year old an Iphone and send them out in a field, they will take a picture of that flower. But we also agree photography is an art form. What makes my cousin's shitty photo of a flower just a flower photograph versus a photo we'd hang in a gallery? What makes a Georgia O'Keeffe painting different than a bad, finger-painted daisy? It's not a set of rules, a sense of style, technique, or form.   **What makes something 'art' is when it transcends the boundaries of sign and signifier**. Art is what happens when you can signify MORE than the connotative value of the sign.   **Here's a word-based example**: no matter what, I can't make you feel what I feel, right? Like, we both see the color blue but there's no way to prove that my subjective experience of blue is the same as yours. Yet, we know there's a similarity because we both see the same \"blue\" things as blue. But I can't jump inside your head and share your vision. At least, not yet. So if I want to express how I'm feeling, I can't just use connotative language. After the miscarriage, I felt sad. That descriptive, it is accurate, but it doesn't make you feel anything. After the miscarriage, I felt depressed. I felt crushed. I felt hopeless. All true, all descriptive, not making you feel my pain. After the miscarriage, my sadness was like cottonmouth in a sandstorm. Metaphor (or simile in this case) is not descriptive. By taking something that does NOT connote, is not literal, but in fact creates a gap or space in meaning, you create an emotion. You still can't feel what i feel, but you will feel something and that something is closer than I could gt you by descriptive language alone. You explain feelings, you create emotions, within the space that can't be descriptive, that is subjective, that defies regular connotation. It's the difference between the finger painting and the O'Keeffe.   **Here's an art example**: [Abstract Expressionism looks like a lot of shitty paint on a canvas. But it was an attempt to answer this question: how do I paint the atom bomb? How to I paint the holocaust? How do I paint fascism? How do I paint my feelings after the miscarriage. Artists using this form did NOT want to represent things. They did not want to paint a mushroom cloud and say, \"Look, there it is\". They went back to primitive forms, to what they thought of as a kind of Jungian, collective mythology of violence and desire. If you think of surrealism as representational dream landscapes, you can think of AE as a kind of non-representational way of visually embodying a nightmare.   **Why was it art and not just paint thrown around?** Because when people looked at it, they didn't see the paint. They saw the nightmare. The art communicated to people that vastness, the blackness, the despair, the frenetic energy, the walls closing in. They looked and the message got across. Not because they were told to feel that, but because the art and the mood connected to the audience.   **But then we take it a step further** and we get to the glass of water on a table. Normal glass, tap water, little placard (*Still* by Exis007). Or you get a Zebra suspended in Listerine ala Damien Hirst. You want to say, \"I look at that and it means fucking nothing to me\" and I'll agree with you. The edge of art has always been, will always be, a kind of con-job. Like...how far can we take this, how much can we push, how esoteric can the communication be and still \"work\" in the sense that working is connecting to the audience. Love or hate that fucking zebra, I feel something when I look at it. What I feel is something akin to rage, but I feel...something. I don't feel anything when I look at my cousin's shitty finger painting. Is it art? I don't know.   **You want there to be rules**. But that misses the point. You want it to work like math, like physics, like logic. But that can't happen because art happens in gaps, in subjective experience, in what we feel but cannot rationally explain. I don't know why WCW's The Red Wheelbarrow fills me with sorrow, but it does. I can't explain it. I can explain the form, I can break it down in terms of historicism, I can analyze the line breaks and the twisting and how the little trickle of information brings out a sense of foreboding. I can tell you HOW he does it. I just can't tell you why.   >I have to ask how does one discriminate what pieces of art are more \"valuable\" than others, what one's we choose to put on display and celebrate, and if art is truly only decided by personal opinion  That's just the metric. Sorry. \"Value\" isn't subjective. Value is decided by auctions, by what people will pay. So, that's objective inasmuch as it is a show of hands. If Billy will pay 10 million dollars for the Listerine Zebra, that's what its worth even if you'd have to pay ME 10 mil to let you put that thing in my house. And, as for what goes in a museum, we all collectively decide that too by a show of hands. People pay other people to decide what will trigger an emotional reaction. If they are good at their jobs, people come. If they are bad at their jobs, people won't come and museum closes. You want a better metric. So have a billion people before you. They want to define it, to say what it is and it isn't, to apply rules.   And they've failed. Every time. Because inevitably someone comes and puts a glass of water on a little pedestal, calls it *Still* by Exis007 and someone feels...something. Rage? Curiosity? It hangs in their brain, it haunts their dreams. It said SOMETHING to them. It was more than a glass of water because it meant more than what it said.   And that's the ballgame.",
            " But who is gonna define what and what isn't art? and on what criteria?  Art, at his most fundamental level, is a communication between an artist and the audience. You can say that a message is stupid but it's still a message so the only debate about any form of art is not to decide whether or not it's art but whether or not it's good.",
            " I think you are missing the purpose and intent of modern art. Modern art isn't saying that anything can be art and that there should be no form in art. There is a story about Jackson Pollack being super drunk and getting mad at other artists in his studio eluding that his work lacked form. He flung paint from his paint brush and hit the door knob 50 feet away and told them that was where the door was and that they could leave.   You are conflating poor attempts at modern art with real meaningful work. Pollack and Kandinsky were both very accomplished in a variety of different types of art before developing their own methods of expression. The concept that perspective and meaning should be binary in a work of art is oppressive.",

            " First I would like to say that I'm not a big fan of modern art either, so I'm basically just going for devil's advocate here  Now, what exactly are you discussing here? Because the meaning of \"art\" is certainly anything you want. Unless you can objectively define art, the only alternative is that it's anything one considers it to be  In a more constrained sense, the art industry makes their own rules. Just like any other industry. In that case, modern art is also indisputably art since there's art being bought, art being sold, people being paid to make modern art etc  On the previous point, it's important to remember that it's not that \"anything is art\", it's that those pieces that you think look bad or whatever are art. That's very different. Being arbitrary is different than being anything at all   I would also like to give some historical background. Modern art exists for a reason. You see, in the past, the art we know as *classical* is very easy to admire. They are trying to mimic reality and some are unbelievably good  The problem is that in the last two centuries we started using something called *photography*. That killed classical art. There was no competing with a camera. That pushed art towards what we now call the modern vanguards or *avant-garde*. Expression of what a camera could never capture or in a way that a camera could never capture  The modern art you're complaining about is the combination of the *avant-garde* movements and the biggest event of the XX century: the WWII. Artists went insane with WWII. As a side-node, art culminated in the nazi movement (there's a great documentary called The Art of Destruction). So what many artists did was completely eradicate, completely negate, what came past. It's from this sentiment that the modern art we know now was born. It's the \"anti-art\" and that's by design  Finally, I would like to point out that modern art can be highly \"scientific\"",
            " So if you ever take an art history class (quite a fun elective even if you're not an arts student. I'm in a Science field and having a blast!)   You will know that good or bad is irrelevant. For 600 years after greek sculptures they were objectively worse in other parts of the world. But they still are important to that era, because they incited an emotional response.   The issue with urban art is we have people who can paint/draw as if they printed something, and we have hyper-realistic art. Computers are doing art now. So our era is dropping the importance of skill as 4 years at an arts academy puts you at printer level. So what gets peoples attention now are the skilled artists that not only do something different from what you're used to seeing, but also something that has meaning. While some art seems like 2 strokes of red, I'll admit, I don't see it, and most people don't but there is one person that might look at that and buy it purely because he knows the painter went through some depression at his life and this could be during the time he didn't have motivation to complete a painting. So to that person that piece is worth a lot. But modern art isn't supposed to be white canvases and splotches it's supposed to be something we know, but done differently, (another) something that isn't just a difficult picture, but something with meaning.   In art history a new era always brings experimentation. They want to see what incites emotion. Stuff like this is more of an outlier in modern art, sadly that is what most people say is modern art. But it's actually just experimentation that will probably fade away as people don't have that much interest. Remember that good art is timeless and bad art will fade away, we won't know what \"modern\" art is for many years. Then we will know the new styles we have brought. between this and  this there is probably less than 200 studied sculptures. But we know there are easily thousands of projects between those, and tons were probably weird expirimentations.   My point is we have had the ability to make near perfect replicas of real-life for some time. Now we have to go way outside the box to still continue an era of artistic creation. And during this time a lot of it is going to look stupid, but as i linked earlier there are some interesting things as well.",

But to try to state a position within it, without understanding the conversation, proves that you haven't thought it through.   >Even if something is made to not be photo realistic or give a perfect impression of reality (Like Impressionism) It still has a form, the form is simply a creation from the artist's own impression rather than an imitation of reality ...] Even many subjective forms might try to imitative objective reality in one way, but choose to ignore or exaggerate certain elements to bring that element of reality to the forefront never the less, it still has form.  Here you're cribbing Plato. Well, sort of cribbing Plato, you haven't gone totally bug-nutty on the ideal form of a flower, but you're more or less making his case. There's there's the flower itself, the actual flower, growing in the dirt. Then there's a photo of the flower, a thousand photos of the flower, trying for representation. Then I paint the flower. I try to paint with perfect representation. I won't get perfect, but I attempt for it. Then I can go out into abstractions of the flower (like Monet, like an impressionist). Maybe I paint a cubist flower. The petals are coming out the stem, round shapes are refracted and disordered into rectangular forms, but at the end of the day, I still have a flower. But then I take my cubist painting, hand it to my impressionist friend, and he paints an impressionist form of my painting. Now, we're still painting the flower but we're painting and impressionist rendition of a cubist's rendition of the flower. Is it still a flower? Hmm...maybe. But then I give that painting to my abstract expressionist friend and he draws a big, yellow streak down the canvas, takes a green line and cuts the yellow streak at a diagonal.   And he says, \"Behold! My flower. It is art!\" And you say, \"No, a bridge too far, that's just two fucking lines of paint\".   And many agree.   **It is not about form**. That's where your argument goes off the rails.   Art has form(s). Form doesn't define art. Art is the relationship between sign and signified. If you give an eight year old an Iphone and send them out in a field, they will take a picture of that flower. But we also agree photography is an art form. What makes my cousin's shitty photo of a flower just a flower photograph versus a photo we'd hang in a gallery? What makes a Georgia O'Keeffe painting different than a bad, finger-painted daisy? It's not a set of rules, a sense of style, technique, or form.   **What makes something 'art' is when it transcends the boundaries of sign and signifier**. Art is what happens when you can signify MORE than the connotative value of the sign.   **Here's a word-based example**: no matter what, I can't make you feel what I feel, right? Like, we both see the color blue but there's no way to prove that my subjective experience of blue is the same as yours. Yet, we know there's a similarity because we both see the same \"blue\" things as blue. But I can't jump inside your head and share your vision. At least, not yet. So if I want to express how I'm feeling, I can't just use connotative language. After the miscarriage, I felt sad. That descriptive, it is accurate, but it doesn't make you feel anything. After the miscarriage, I felt depressed. I felt crushed. I felt hopeless. All true, all descriptive, not making you feel my pain. After the miscarriage, my sadness was like cottonmouth in a sandstorm. Metaphor (or simile in this case) is not descriptive. By taking something that does NOT connote, is not literal, but in fact creates a gap or space in meaning, you create an emotion. You still can't feel what i feel, but you will feel something and that something is closer than I could gt you by descriptive language alone. You explain feelings, you create emotions, within the space that can't be descriptive, that is subjective, that defies regular connotation. It's the difference between the finger painting and the O'Keeffe.   **Here's an art example**: [Abstract Expressionism looks like a lot of shitty paint on a canvas. But it was an attempt to answer this question: how do I paint the atom bomb? How to I paint the holocaust? How do I paint fascism? How do I paint my feelings after the miscarriage. Artists using this form did NOT want to represent things. They did not want to paint a mushroom cloud and say, \"Look, there it is\". They went back to primitive forms, to what they thought of as a kind of Jungian, collective mythology of violence and desire. If you think of surrealism as representational dream landscapes, you can think of AE as a kind of non-representational way of visually embodying a nightmare.   **Why was it art and not just paint thrown around?** Because when people looked at it, they didn't see the paint. They saw the nightmare. The art communicated to people that vastness, the blackness, the despair, the frenetic energy, the walls closing in. They looked and the message got across. Not because they were told to feel that, but because the art and the mood connected to the audience.   **But then we take it a step further** and we get to the glass of water on a table. Normal glass, tap water, little placard (*Still* by Exis007). Or you get a Zebra suspended in Listerine ala Damien Hirst. You want to say, \"I look at that and it means fucking nothing to me\" and I'll agree with you. The edge of art has always been, will always be, a kind of con-job. Like...how far can we take this, how much can we push, how esoteric can the communication be and still \"work\" in the sense that working is connecting to the audience. Love or hate that fucking zebra, I feel something when I look at it. What I feel is something akin to rage, but I feel...something. I don't feel anything when I look at my cousin's shitty finger painting. Is it art? I don't know.   **You want there to be rules**. But that misses the point. You want it to work like math, like physics, like logic. But that can't happen because art happens in gaps, in subjective experience, in what we feel but cannot rationally explain. I don't know why WCW's The Red Wheelbarrow fills me with sorrow, but it does. I can't explain it. I can explain the form, I can break it down in terms of historicism, I can analyze the line breaks and the twisting and how the little trickle of information brings out a sense of foreboding. I can tell you HOW he does it. I just can't tell you why.   >I have to ask how does one discriminate what pieces of art are more \"valuable\" than others, what one's we choose to put on display and celebrate, and if art is truly only decided by personal opinion  That's just the metric. Sorry. \"Value\" isn't subjective. Value is decided by auctions, by what people will pay. So, that's objective inasmuch as it is a show of hands. If Billy will pay 10 million dollars for the Listerine Zebra, that's what its worth even if you'd have to pay ME 10 mil to let you put that thing in my house. And, as for what goes in a museum, we all collectively decide that too by a show of hands. People pay other people to decide what will trigger an emotional reaction. If they are good at their jobs, people come. If they are bad at their jobs, people won't come and museum closes. You want a better metric. So have a billion people before you. They want to define it, to say what it is and it isn't, to apply rules.   And they've failed. Every time. Because inevitably someone comes and puts a glass of water on a little pedestal, calls it *Still* by Exis007 and someone feels...something. Rage? Curiosity? It hangs in their brain, it haunts their dreams. It said SOMETHING to them. It was more than a glass of water because it meant more than what it said.   And that's the ballgame.",
            " It seems to me that you are trying to consider \"modern\" (a term you used incorrectly- Modern refers to a specific period that does not cover the examples you provided. The term you are looking for is avant garde) art as it's own separate entity, as a clearly bounded movement, when in reality it's a continuation of a very long history spanning hundreds of years.  What we consider today to be \"avant garde\" (which loosely translates to cutting edge) is the result of people trying to do the very thing it seems you're trying to do in this post- find out what art really is. Throughout the past couple of hundred years, we developed many new styles, from Picasso's cubism, to Monet's impressionism, to the minimalism of Mondrian, and it shook up our definition of what art was. Where Christianity had for millennia dominated western art with its religious abstraction, and the Renaissance put a massive emphasis on realism, there was instead a growing fascination with pure abstraction: how far could we remove art from object?  It's not really about the object in these cases (especially in the case of \"ready-mades\" or performance art) so much as a form of meta-art, in that their purpose is sort of to call into question the nature of art. It's not about visual representation, and in many cases it's not about representation at all.  Take minimalism (Mondrian is a key artist here), for example, which tries to get at the core principles of art by stripping away everything else. While these works aren't the most complex or the most demanding in terms of technique, they try to do something entirely different than realist art- they try to show what is at the core of art. Mondrian, for example, was attempting to use simple arrangements of primary colors to create the \"perfect\" art, to approximate true beauty through getting rid of everything else.  And the same can be said for pretty much any artist, and pretty much any artistic movement, even if some of them are extremely nihilist (like ready-mades). This isn't art for wide audiences though, instead, it's better to think of it as art for artists. Generally, people want to be able to look at a work of art and fully understand it just from what is visually available to them, and that's fine. But there is a large subset of art that is heavily contextual, and that attempts to break down just what art is. This is no less art than traditional art.",
            " What's missing from your analysis is context of the time in which these objects were created. The latrine piece you mention, *Fountain* by Marcel Duchamp, was created in 1917, when Modernism was very much in its infancy. Cubism, the genre created in part by Picasso, was less than 10 years old. Surrealism, Dali's genre, had yet to be developed, and on the examples go. We can look back today and see clear developments within Modernism, but in 1917, the period was anything but clear and nailed down, with new forms of art heretofore unseen popping up every year or two and no one sure where things would go.    *Fountain* was born in this environment. Duchamp saw an advertisement for an art show by the Society of Independent Artists wherein so long as each artist paid the entrance fee, all pieces would be accepted. Duchamp sent it in as an experiment. Would they accept it? Would they think it was some new artistic breakthrough? Would they draw the line? They rejected the piece. But what did that mean for art in this tumultuous period of development? Clearly some people, even those directly involved in art, drew the line somewhere, but where exactly *was* that line? Duchamp had a new data point to answer that question.     That's why the piece is famous, not because it was some grand expression on Duchamp's part but because of the intent behind it. Pushing the boundaries of the maybe acceptable as far as he thought they could go just to see if he hit a brick wall along the way. At least then the period would be a bit more defined for him. A lot of the other pieces you would likely be turned off by have similar backstories and aren't just putting a toilet in a museum for the hell of it.",
            " I think you are missing the purpose and intent of modern art. Modern art isn't saying that anything can be art and that there should be no form in art. There is a story about Jackson Pollack being super drunk and getting mad at other artists in his studio eluding that his work lacked form. He flung paint from his paint brush and hit the door knob 50 feet away and told them that was where the door was and that they could leave.   You are conflating poor attempts at modern art with real meaningful work. Pollack and Kandinsky were both very accomplished in a variety of different types of art before developing their own methods of expression. The concept that perspective and meaning should be binary in a work of art is oppressive.",

            " First I would like to say that I'm not a big fan of modern art either, so I'm basically just going for devil's advocate here  Now, what exactly are you discussing here? Because the meaning of \"art\" is certainly anything you want. Unless you can objectively define art, the only alternative is that it's anything one considers it to be  In a more constrained sense, the art industry makes their own rules. Just like any other industry. In that case, modern art is also indisputably art since there's art being bought, art being sold, people being paid to make modern art etc  On the previous point, it's important to remember that it's not that \"anything is art\", it's that those pieces that you think look bad or whatever are art. That's very different. Being arbitrary is different than being anything at all   I would also like to give some historical background. Modern art exists for a reason. You see, in the past, the art we know as *classical* is very easy to admire. They are trying to mimic reality and some are unbelievably good  The problem is that in the last two centuries we started using something called *photography*. That killed classical art. There was no competing with a camera. That pushed art towards what we now call the modern vanguards or *avant-garde*. Expression of what a camera could never capture or in a way that a camera could never capture  The modern art you're complaining about is the combination of the *avant-garde* movements and the biggest event of the XX century: the WWII. Artists went insane with WWII. As a side-node, art culminated in the nazi movement (there's a great documentary called The Art of Destruction). So what many artists did was completely eradicate, completely negate, what came past. It's from this sentiment that the modern art we know now was born. It's the \"anti-art\" and that's by design  Finally, I would like to point out that modern art can be highly \"scientific\"",

You will know that good or bad is irrelevant. For 600 years after greek sculptures they were objectively worse in other parts of the world. But they still are important to that era, because they incited an emotional response.   The issue with urban art is we have people who can paint/draw as if they printed something, and we have hyper-realistic art. Computers are doing art now. So our era is dropping the importance of skill as 4 years at an arts academy puts you at printer level. So what gets peoples attention now are the skilled artists that not only do something different from what you're used to seeing, but also something that has meaning.

But it's actually just experimentation that will probably fade away as people don't have that much interest. Remember that good art is timeless and bad art will fade away, we won't know what \"modern\" art is for many years. Then we will know the new styles we have brought. between this and  this there is probably less than 200 studied sculptures.

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: The same logic that argues for the acceptance of transgender people can be applied to 'trans-race' people Please let me preface by saying that I do believe trans men are men and trans women are women. If you want to challenge that part of my view, fine, but I'd rather have a focus on the 'transrace' concept. I'm a POC, and while I would be somewhat more skeptical of 'transrace' people than transgender people (which is in part due to stigma and in part due to the lack of research that has actually been done into being 'transrace'), I don't understand why so many people who believe being transgender is valid are so quick to dismiss people who say they are trans-race.  * Trans people experience gender dysphoria, the 'cure' for which is to transition. Hypothetically, if a person felt physically and mentally uncomfortable with their own appearance to the degree of dysphoria in terms of race or ethnicity, would the 'cure' not be to transition to a different race? * Many people say that trans people don't necessarily need dysphoria, just the desire for society to perceive them as a gender that isn't the one they were assigned at birth. In this case, if someone wanted society to perceive them as another race/ethnicity, is there any significant difference? * It's true that being a part of a certain race or ethnicity isn't a 'feeling' but rather more of a cultural experience, or even just a different appearance from other ethnicities or races. However, many people could argue the same about gender--there isn't any way to 'feel' like a certain gender outside of the cultural experience and societal perception. * Having people be trans-race isn't technically harming anyone. Acknowledging trans women are women does not harm cis women, and I feel that being transrace could even be considered less controversial, just because there would be no arguments about sports or bathrooms or other transgender 'hot topics.'  I do realize that there are a lot less people claiming to be trans race, and there is a lot less history backing it up, but I don't think it can entirely be dismissed because of the strong pushback against it--I'm sure that fifty years ago, many transgender people were closeted too. I also realize there's almost no hard science behind it, but it's so quickly dismissed that I don't believe it's even been studied seriously.  Please CMV.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " There\u2019s a lot of emerging science behind the idea that transgenderism is rooted in genetic/biological differences, whereas the concept of trans-race is really a social phenomenon.  Just from Wikipedia:   Transgender brain studies, especially those on trans women who are sexually attracted to women (gynephilic), and those on trans men who are sexually attracted to men (androphilic), are limited, as they include a small number of tested individuals.[2] The available research indicates that the brain structure of androphilic trans women with early-onset gender dysphoria is similar to the brain structure of cisgender women's and unlike cisgender men's.[2] It also reports that both androphilic trans women and trans women with late-onset gender dysphoria who are gynephilic have different brain phenotypes, and that gynephilic trans women differ from both cisgender male and female controls in non-dimorphic brain areas.[2] Cortical thickness, which is generally thicker in cisgender women's brains than in cisgender men's brains, may also be thicker in trans women's brains, but is present in a different location to cisgender women's brains.[2] For trans men, research indicates that those with early-onset gender dysphoria and who are gynephilic have brains that generally correspond to their assigned sex, but that they have their own phenotype with respect to cortical thickness, subcortical structures, and white matter microstructure, especially in the right hemisphere.[2] Hormone use can also affect transgender people's brain structure; it can cause transgender women's brains to become closer to those of cisgender women, and morphological increments observed in the brains of trans men might be due to the anabolic effects of testosterone.[2]  Twin studies suggest that there are likely genetic causes of transsexuality, although the precise genes involved are not fully understood.",

            " > The same logic that argues for the acceptance of transgender people can be applied to 'trans-race' people  You're basically arguing by analogy - some things can be viewed the same, therefore the conclusion must be the same.  Support for trans rights is supported by medical science and research, with decades of documented cases of transgender people that demonstrate that enabling them to live as their identified gender (including gender reassignment in many cases) is beneficial to their mental health, well-being, and social functioning, as this alleviates the distress they feel from the mismatch between their sex and gender assigned at birth.  Just because one can make an analogy with transgender people, doesn't mean that people (e.g. like Dolezal) who claim to be transracial are having an equivalent experience with race instead of gender, or that letting transracial persons live as their preferred race (and modify their bodies), is going to be just as beneficial to their mental health and well-being, as letting people live as their experienced gender. There are no documented cases of transracial dysphoria or lesser levels of distress of a similar kind (yet?) And the fact that there aren't already thousands of Dolezals around the world gives us at least some clue as to how likely that is.  If there really is such a thing as being transracial, it will need to be researched separately, to see what kinds of distress are (potentially) involved, and which treatment or approach best serves their needs. One can't just conclude that because living as the identified gender works in the case of trans persons, it is therefore necessarily also the best approach for alleged transracial persons. That would be medically irresponsible. For all we know, someone like Dolezal might be better served by psychological treatment to accept their \"birth race\", the equivalent of which has not been shown to work for transgender persons.",

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: We have enough food to feed everyone, the concept of sharing has not been applied well I read on various websites that we have enough food to feed the world, the problem with starvation comes from the ability to actually give the food. Now, it is my belief that sharing is caring. I also believe that entire concept got really messed up during the Cold War. Basically, maybe I'm really crazy but America promoted Capitalism, which is to say they promoted having a good quality of food. They kept improving their stuff such that it became a competition of quality against quality rather than quality against quantity. This created the unintended affect of people becoming very greedy, unwilling to share cause the quality of their food was top notch so giving it away felt like a burden.   On the opposite end of this was the U.S.S.R. They fed everyone but the quality was barely sub par. This, combined with higher ranking officers getting a better quality of life, led to a stigma where the lower class citizens would get lower class food.  Finally, propaganda from both sides against each other meant that people would 1)stick to their borders for sharing as to not upset either of them and 2) believe in both sides. This has lead to today, where the rich and powerful are not willing to share and end the hunger problems. And I don't see any way to change.

I think you need to understand that before you start mis-attributing where the problem lies. The fundamental problem lies with people having power who are not answerable to the people who might suffer starvation, once you have that situation then a famine is easily possible.   So in principle we do have enough food to feed everyone but if you think capitalism is the problem you have rather missed the problem. Yes a capitalist system can have famines (British India) but generally when run within a functioning democracy it never does.

Less and less people are going hungry because of our efforts to get food to needy places but that doesn't mean we can get food everywhere all the time logistics are a bitch.   Second  >On the opposite end of this was the U.S.S.R. They fed everyone but the quality was barely sub par. This, combined with higher ranking officers getting a better quality of life, led to a stigma where the lower class citizens would get lower class food.  Communism has never fed everyone in the U.S.S.R. people were digging up their dead toddlers to eat... that's how fucking bad it got, this isn't propaganda this is what literally happened it's a matter of historical record it's just been memory holed and that was just in their own country dealing with the logistics of feeding the whole world would be orders of magnitudes harder than the thing they failed to accomplish.",
        "rejected_target": " >This created the unintended affect of people becoming very greedy, unwilling to share cause the quality of their food was top notch so giving it away felt like a burden.  People have never been any more generous than they are right now. The problem is that is incredibly difficult to distribute food to people who live in areas controlled by warlords. Also, you can't just give people food willy nilly. You may mess up the local economy because farmers will have to compete against free food. You need a deep knowledge of an area if you want to help it."

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: Most of the times that people describe someone they disagree with as a \"narcissist\" or \"lacking empathy\", it's not even remotely accurate and it's cause they can't accept the fact that other people just disagree with them. Example.  Person1: I agree with anti-homeless benches. The less homeless people in this area the better.  Person2: You are such a narcissist! I can't believe you're so lacking in empathy!  &#x200B;  Let's assume for a moment that Person1 isn't a sociopathic serial killer and has a more realistic motivation. Let's say that Person1 thinks that homeless people are generally a detriment to the safety of a given area, and that the safety of the general population is more important than the comfort of homeless people.  &#x200B;  Is Person1 lacking in empathy? Is this thinking narcissistic?  Obviously not. Person1 is just empathizing with a different group that Person2.  &#x200B;  However, Person2 likely BELIEVES in the validity of their statement. Despite the factual inaccuracy.  &#x200B;  Since I see this sort of scenario play out hundreds if not 1000s of times a day on Reddit, this is why I believe in the validity of MY OWN statement.  &#x200B;  People call each other names because they can't accept the fact that other people just disagree with them.  &#x200B;  Change my mind.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: The Body Positivity Movement should be about becoming a healthier and better person, instead it just supports and promotes stagnant acceptance. There are a few points I will make right off the bat:  * It's well known that the body positivity movement is primarily catered to those who are overweight/obese, this specific group and message are what I will be specifically discussing. While this movement does include things like skin conditions, burns, etc. These are not things someone can generally change, and are irrelevant to my argument. * Acceptance of ones weight regardless of the size is one of the founding principles of this movement * I do not believe anyone is morally in the wrong for choosing to LIVE an unhealthy lifestyle themselves. My qualms are with those that PROMOTE an unhealthy lifestyle as healthy to others. * I do not believe it should be anyone's goal to meet any sort of socially constructed beauty standards * I was born in and reside in the U.S. so due to that my examples and beliefs are directed there.  Okay now that those are out of the way I can begin (PLEASE make sure you read everything thoroughly before commenting)  It is my belief that the current body positivity movement is actually more damaging to the health and lifestyles of those in society. The current body positivity movement promotes heavily the acceptance of \"all sizes\" this is directed of course to your weight. This is damaging because it convinces people to simply accept whatever stage they are at in life weight-wise and it promotes stagnation. No matter how tolerant you want to be, it is illogical and unscientific to deny that at some point weight becomes a health factor/problem. This movement is essentially saying that you need to ignore these things and simply accept your weight as \"who you are\" and it claims that trying to lose weight through a better diet, exercise, etc, is only due to a need to fit into these hypothetical socially constructed beauty standards (I say hypothetical because the topic of beauty standards is something that is still debated and i dont want to take away from my point in this post). This brings me to my next point which is that beauty standards are not primarily the reason someone who is overweight is going to want to lose weight; and even if it is there is nothing inherently wrong with someone who wants to look better and feel better about themselves as long as they are doing so in a healthy manner. By healthy manner i mean proper meal plans, exercise, changing bad habits, etc. This movement tries to demonize anyone who is trying to actively change themselves for the better so that those who are in stagnation and just accept where they are at can feel better about themselves.  Now here is my idea of what the body positivity could and should be. I imagine a movement that encourages people to NOT accept where they are and to continuously try to better themselves physically and mentally. In all aspects of life if you stagnate and stop trying to improve you will stop making progress, why should we treat our own bodies any differently? at what point did it become bad to encourage a healthy and active lifestyle? Obesity is a huge problem that has gotten exponentially worse in America which everyone can agree on; and while there are many aspects to this problem i believe that lifestyle choices are THE PRIMARY reason. I think we need a positivity movement that encourages you to live a better and healthier lifestyle! Not to meet some stupid social standards but instead so that as a society we can live healthier and happier lives. The current movement does not encourage this and would rather you resign to whatever current condition your body is in. I think true body positivity is being able to love yourself enough to put in that extra effort to live a happier and healthier life.   This is my view, I am always trying to hear and consider all sides of a discussion so please, try to change my mind!\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: cmv: Metric is better than imperial and the US should switch Quickly, how many pounds are there in 100 ounces? How many feet are there in a mile? Which is greater: 5.5 pints, 94 fluid ounces, or 3 quarts? How many square yards are there in an acre?   At the very least, most people would fumble a bit before seriously answering any of these questions. Maybe even use a calculator or reference guide. At worse, some people would not try or be able to answer some of these questions.   The Imperial System is obviously very clumsy and confusing to use even for Americans. This is the reason why the United States of America should finally stop using the Imperial System of measurement. To be fair, there are two other countries that also use the Imperial System, and they are Liberia and Myanmar (Burma).    These three countries should instead use the Metric System. The Metric System is superior to the Imperial System for three reasons.   First, the Metric System is simple to understand. The simplicity of a base 10 system of measurement, such as the Metric System, makes it extremely easy to understand especially when dealing different scales of measures, such as meters versus kilometers. For example, it is obvious that 100 meters is 1/10 of a kilometer. No serious thinking is necessary.   Second, calculations in the Metric System are also easier. This is probably why most researchers, doctors, and scientists use the Metric System even in the United States. For example, which is greater: 989 grams, 1.1 kilograms, or 1 million milligrams? How many meters are there in a kilometer? How many milliliters are there in 1.25 liters?   Third, the Metric System is the international standard. This is probably the most important reason. Car manufacturers already realized that having similar parts in different measurements for different countries was a waste of resources, so all cars are now built using the Metric System for redundancy eliminations and cost reductions. Furthermore, all goods exported outside of the United States have to be label in metrics, or else they can not be sold. N.A.S.A. actually lost a $125 million dollar spacecraft, called the Mars Climate Orbiter, over the planet Mars, because one team was using the Metric System and another team was using the Imperial System. That was a very costly mistake that could have been avoided if everyone in the world used the same system of measurement. Since over 90% of the world uses the Metric System, it is by default the international standard.    The Metric System has been proven to be far superior than the Imperial System, so why hasn't the United States of America converted? I believe it is NOT because Americans are afraid of the Metric System, but rather Americans are concerned over how painful the conversion process would be. In the long term, I believe the benefits and cost savings to convert to the Metric System would greatly offset the short term inconveniences.   As a result, the United States of America should finally and completely stop using the Imperial System of measurement for the Metric System that has been proven to be simpler to understand, easier to calculate, the international standard, and reduce redundancies, errors, and costs.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " So I gotta say, I really can't think of an industry that would benefit from adopting metric that hasn't already adopted metric.  Aerospace? Metric. Pharmaceuticals? Metric. Etc etc.  Where metric hasn't been adopted, there clearly hasn't been a huge *reason* to adopt it. e.g.,:  * Street signs? How *often* do you need to convert miles to feet, and feet to miles? At what level of precision? Sure, I agree, 5,280 is super arbitrary... but it doesn't stop me from knowing that 500 feet is about .1 miles, which is all I need to understand my GPS. Where's the driving reason to convert? * Recipes? Sure, if I want to get scientific about it, I'll weigh it all out in grams and ml ... but outside of baking (where many have already switched), how often is that the case? Most recipes are based on ratios, and \"1/2 a cup of this, 1/4 of a cup of that\" is intuitive and simple, and *would not benefit from more precision.* Where's the driving reason to convert? * Carpentry and construction? Sure, I get that it's easier to *conceptualize* cutting a meter in half and getting 50 centimeters than it is to conceptualize cutting a yard in half and getting 18 inches, but using a base 12 system and fractions is generally actually easier *in real life* than using a base 10 system and decimalization, because the cuts you're doing aren't arbitrary -- they're generally in half, quarter, or thirds, which (in Imperial) all come out to nice round numbers that are themselves easily divisible. Half a foot? six inches. A third of a foot? four inches. A quarter of a foot? three inches. Etc. What's the driving reason to convert?  The Imperial system's main advantage is that its units of measure are intended to make it easy to do day-to-day hand-tasks (like gauge traveling distance, or make soup, or build a dresser). That's the *reason* it's so inconsistent -- but it also makes it very sticky, and means that adoption of metric tends to happen quickly *where it makes life more convenient,* and happen much more slowly where it doesn't.  Cases in point: you mentioned the US is one of only three countries using the imperial system ... it actually isn't. It's one of many countries having *incompletely converted.*  * Height and weight? Those'll be in feet and inches anywhere in North America. Weight'll be in stone in the UK, for crying out loud ... *and* they use feet and inches for height. * How fast are you going on the highway? Canada'll use km/h... but if you're in the UK or America, or anywhere in the Carribean, or you're a railway system anywhere in North America (which is expensive to convert), speed of a vehicle is measured in miles / hour. * Buying gasoline? For some reason about 30 countries have decided to use gallons for gasoline, even if they use liters for everything else. * For that matter, buying beer? You still buy that in pints in a dozen countries (but what \"pint\" means differs).  Basically, the more benefit there is to having an innate sense for what a measurement \"means\", and the less detriment there is to having to do conversions, the less likely it is for people to make the shift.",
            " Many Americans use both systems.  We use metric when it is the more convenient system and US Customary when it is the most convenient system.  What hasn't been done is enforcing the removal of US Customary.  This is because the upfront costs are massive.  Tons of machines and devices are already geared and calibrated for US Customary.  Tons of people are already used to using a certain set of units and getting them to learn a new set of units that they aren't already familiar with will take a lot of time and effort.  The US has been slowly progressing towards using more and more Metric.  We've just adapted a slow conversion where we switch to metric where it makes sense and don't bother with the unnecessary effort and expense to convert to metric where it doesn't.  For a sense of the cost of such a conversion, just changing road signs is estimated to be $750 million.  That's only changing the road signs and doesn't account for things like are likely more extensive such as retooling factories.  If we were building everything from the ground up, maybe starting with Metric would make sense.  But we were already heavily industrialized by the time it was proposed.    >How many square yards are there in an acre?  Side note that most people would struggle to convert square meters to square kilometers.  It's not as neat of a conversion as simply going meter to kilometer and I have watched it confuse a lot of people.    For the other examples, yes converting between metric equivalents is easier.  But, the main factor is how infrequently these conversions are done.  For example, no one works with both feet and miles at the same time.  It is either one or the other.   The negatives of the US Customary system are not as significant as you seem to think.  Also, Metric is not without it's flawed units where other systems are better.  Fahrenheit is superior to Celsius for weather reporting.  Freezing to boiling is not a useful scale for describing weather but having 0 and 100 be roughly the lower end and the upper end of the typical temperatures experienced on Earth makes it a very handy system for describing weather events.  Yes, there are outliers to either end, but they are rare.  Not like how the Celcius scale needs to go negative all the time but we rarely get above 40.  With pressure, I absolutely hate Pa.  Psi is also stupid, but the Metric unit isn't much better.  We should be standardized globally to atm or if we want something that makes physics calculations a bit smoother something like bar.  I have no idea why Metric settled on Pa, but I wouldn't call it a smart decision.",

Etc etc.  Where metric hasn't been adopted, there clearly hasn't been a huge *reason* to adopt it. e.g.,:  * Street signs? How *often* do you need to convert miles to feet, and feet to miles? At what level of precision? Sure, I agree, 5,280 is super arbitrary... but it doesn't stop me from knowing that 500 feet is about .1 miles, which is all I need to understand my GPS. Where's the driving reason to convert? * Recipes? Sure, if I want to get scientific about it, I'll weigh it all out in grams and ml ... but outside of baking (where many have already switched), how often is that the case? Most recipes are based on ratios, and \"1/2 a cup of this, 1/4 of a cup of that\" is intuitive and simple, and *would not benefit from more precision.* Where's the driving reason to convert? * Carpentry and construction? Sure, I get that it's easier to *conceptualize* cutting a meter in half and getting 50 centimeters than it is to conceptualize cutting a yard in half and getting 18 inches, but using a base 12 system and fractions is generally actually easier *in real life* than using a base 10 system and decimalization, because the cuts you're doing aren't arbitrary -- they're generally in half, quarter, or thirds, which (in Imperial) all come out to nice round numbers that are themselves easily divisible. Half a foot? six inches. A third of a foot? four inches. A quarter of a foot? three inches. Etc. What's the driving reason to convert?  The Imperial system's main advantage is that its units of measure are intended to make it easy to do day-to-day hand-tasks (like gauge traveling distance, or make soup, or build a dresser). That's the *reason* it's so inconsistent -- but it also makes it very sticky, and means that adoption of metric tends to happen quickly *where it makes life more convenient,* and happen much more slowly where it doesn't.  Cases in point: you mentioned the US is one of only three countries using the imperial system ... it actually isn't. It's one of many countries having *incompletely converted.*  * Height and weight? Those'll be in feet and inches anywhere in North America. Weight'll be in stone in the UK, for crying out loud ... *and* they use feet and inches for height. * How fast are you going on the highway? Canada'll use km/h... but if you're in the UK or America, or anywhere in the Carribean, or you're a railway system anywhere in North America (which is expensive to convert), speed of a vehicle is measured in miles / hour. * Buying gasoline? For some reason about 30 countries have decided to use gallons for gasoline, even if they use liters for everything else. * For that matter, buying beer? You still buy that in pints in a dozen countries (but what \"pint\" means differs).  Basically, the more benefit there is to having an innate sense for what a measurement \"means\", and the less detriment there is to having to do conversions, the less likely it is for people to make the shift.",
        "rejected_target": " Why are you doing unit analysis on the fly all day? When do you need to make an important decision that involves converting between units where you can\u2019t use a calculator or pen and paper?  On another note, why should units that are used in everyday civilian life be tied to bizarre natural phenomena? \u201cHow far is a meter?\u201d \u201cOh you know, about how far light travels in a vacuum is 1/xth of a second.\u201d   Why should we measure mass according to the mass of some small unit of water? We should measure things in units that are sensible for their scale. Humans are 100 to 300 pounds usually, which means they are 45,000 to 136,000 grams. That\u2019s not an intuitive scale. \u201cHow long is this movie?\u201d \u201c450,000 seconds.\u201d It\u2019s incomprehensible, and you need to use all sorts of prefixes to make it easier to grasp.

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: keeping children \"innocent\" is detrimental to their development I am M/24 and thinking about having kids in the next 3-4 years.   One of the concepts that I've always disagreed with is \"robbing kids of their innocence.\" I just don't feel like time spent being innocent is important to have a fulfilling childhood. Also, kids that did have their innocence taken away early on - such as the age of 4-12 grow up with more maturity and develop better ability to handle complex situations effectively.   I understand this could put a lot of pressure on young minds and could have detrimental effects - some situations where I would treat the child as an adult vs. where I wouldn't;  If I can afford food, clothing and shelter, then I will explain to my child if we are poor/rich and how it impacts us. If we are barely scaping by, I would try to make them understand that while its unfair, its how life is right now - that things can change.   I would teach my kids about death as a natural process if a distant relative died, but I wouldn't tell them their dog died because that could cause emotional trauma.   These lessons would have the most impact on a younger mind, I would have to be careful not to say anything disturbing but I believe its well worth the effort.  I believe you should take away a child's innocence if it can be done in a healthy way.   \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  My dad was blunt with me, he ran a business and would come home stressed when his accounts receivable was adding up. We had bills and mortgage to pay and he was very transparent about not being able to meet payments. It made me value money more, question why things cost as much as they do and I think I have a better understanding than others from an early age.   While it did cause stress, it gave me a head start when compared to the blissfully ignorant kids that could not understand why their parents wouldn't buy what they wanted - these were the kids saying shit like \"my moms a b\\*tch.\" When my dad said NO to buying an Xbox, I understood and didn't pester him, I didn't throw a tantrum because I understood he would have bought me one if he could. My innocence wasn't robbed, I was taught the importance of spending when you don't have it. Later down the line, I did end up getting an Xbox, just had to wait an additional 8 months for my dad to have that kind of discretionary spending (\\~$400).   Should I not take opportunities to teach my kids about gender inequality, stereotyping, financial stability, death, being born lucky, war, drug abuse, or grandparents going senile? (just some examples off the top of my head).   All for the sake of innocence, which I just don't see any benefits to. I feel like it should be my parental duty to teach these things in a warm and supportive environment and not let life be the only teacher.  &#x200B;  CMV reddit.\n\nAssistant:": {

I am not a parent but I have a degree in neuroscience with a minor in cognitive science. I worked in a research lab for a little bit that focused on adults with anxiety and/or emotional dysregulation disorder secondary to C-PTSD. We see a pattern with adults who have C-PTSD.

As I said before - too much worry about the how\u2019s, what\u2019s and when\u2019s as a child puts them into survival mode and they fail to learn how to regulate emotions among many other things.

Now, please understand I am not saying that you as an individual are not healthy, stable or \u201cnormal\u201d. I don\u2019t know you or the whole story. But my from a psychological science stand point, it\u2019s not healthy for a child. Bottom line. It sounds like you turned out lovely and I\u2019m happy for that. But there is such a fine line and since we can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on the child\u2019s brain, why tip toe it? There will be plenty of time to teach these lessons. My parents struggled a lot when we were children and we had *no idea.* But when I was six and I didn\u2019t understand why I couldn\u2019t have a bounce house at my birthday party like Becky down the street, my parents took it as a learning opportunity. They sat me down and explained to me that some families have more extra cash than others. They made sure I understood that because they love me, first priority is making sure I have the clothes I need, the food I eat and the roof over my head. If it were up to them, they would buy me everything I *wanted* but at this point in time there isn\u2019t a lot of money for wants once the needs are taken care of. When I asked why some families have more money than others, my dad told me it was the jobs they chose. They didn\u2019t make a lot of money, but they didn\u2019t work a lot of hours either and that meant more time spent at home. I understood and hearing no in the future was easy but I still never had to worry if my needs would be neglected. They taught me not only the value of a dollar but also planted the seed for learning the lesson of valuing my time later in life.   Let kids be kids. They have their whole life to worry about stability/security. There\u2019s actually a nice little inverted bell curve that shows as children we feel safe/secure/stable. We lose that sense around the time we go to college and it doesn\u2019t return until around 50-60yo. Just some food for thought. If you\u2019re thinking \u201cWell that\u2019s my point! Maybe they would still feel secure/stable once they leave for college if I teach them about the real world at a young age!\u201d Even the best parent who prepares their child before leaving home by teaching them everything about the world isn\u2019t going to change this. Nothing is promised and the future is unknown which is why most people reported having the sense of insecurity. Once you reach your 50s, you\u2019re usually secure and probably headed for retirement so the future is pretty clear.   Be honest and teach lessons but consider not letting your future children see the \u201cadult struggles\u201d you deal with as an adult. That can be scary and confusing at a young age!  Edit: I also want to add that I\u2019ve thought about how my parents raised me quite a bit. If I had realized how much my parents struggled despite having college degrees, I would have probably been more hard pressed to get a graduate degree or become a doctor.

Had I decided to just get a bachelors, that would have been fine too because poor or not, my parents were always one thing: *happy.*",
            " I would argue that neither extreme is good. There's a middle ground of introducing the hard topics slowly, as they come up, instead of hiding them forever or introducing them willy-nilly. And, of course, as the children are mentally, intellectually, and emotionally ready to handle it.  To use an example from my own life that has earned itself a place in family lore, one year while on vacation my parents sat me (six) and my brother (four) down and placed four $20 bills on the table in front of us. They presented us with a choice: we could either use the money to go to a water park for the day, or we could have the money to spend on whatever we wanted. I started thinking about what I could buy with forty whole dollars, got choice paralysis, and froze up. My brother burst into tears.  This was about two months after my grandma had died. The night after the funeral I realized that since grandma died, my new cousin who had been born a few months before would never have a memory of her. I didn't have a memory of grandma's mom, or grandma, etc etc, so everyone before must have died as well. If everyone else dies, I probably will too. Huh. That's interesting. Time to go to sleep.  I was able to come to terms with my own mortality on my own, but drop forty dollars in front of me and I didn't know what to do. Everyone is ready for different things at different times, and in different levels.  What do I mean by different levels? Let's take your example of grandparents going senile, as that one is near and dear to my heart as I'm going through it now with my other grandma.   * There's the full-on innocence protection method, which would be to have as little contact as possible to let the kids have only good memories of grandma, if any. * There's the middle ground method, where they're told that grandma isn't quite alright, it's kind of like how when you were sick with a bad fever and didn't know what was going on around you. Adjust based on age and maturity. * Then there's the full disclosure method, where the kids are told in no uncertain terms that grandma thinks it's 1972 and doesn't know that they exist, so she'll probably confuse you for your dad. Come here and help me change her diaper - oh yeah, she can't go to the bathroom by herself either. Welcome to adulting.  There's a balance, and that's the trick of parenting - figuring out how much your kid is able to handle. My family had a great discussion about the history of racism when we read Tom Sawyer when I was... Eight? Nine? Somewhere around there. But I wasn't at a point where I could have understood the more subtle problems like Stop And Frisk, or the deeper long-lasting effects of Jim Crow laws, or the vastness of the issues with police brutality. You actually summed it up pretty well with your example of the death of a distant relative vs the family dog. One is far easier for a young mind to wrap its head around.  In summary, every kid is different. Some are able to handle more than others, and if they aren't at a point where they can handle something then yes you should absolutely work to preserve their innocence surrounding it. Because while it's certainly not optimal to be thrown into life without experience, it can be detrimental to be forced into that experience before you're ready.",

            " I think that when people talk of 'preserving a child's innocence', what they mean isn't necessarily that children should be shielded from all of the things you list above until they run into them unprepared in adult life. Mostly, what they mean is that children should be exposed to these things as gradually as possible, at the right age, and in a developmentally appropriate way. E.g., you could do real damage if you were openly complaining about money problems all the time to your eight-year-old, telling them that you find life without a lot of income unbearable, making them feel like it's (in part) their responsibility to solve your money problems and make you happy. Which, by virtue of them being eight years old and unable to go out and get a job, is too much responsibility to lay on an eight-year-old.      There is nothing inherently wrong with the way your father exposed you to the realities of life, and in: we can't all get what we want whenever we want it. You'll have to wait a few months for your Xbox, or maybe save up for it yourself. There are limits to the money we can spend. There \\*are\\*, however, also limits on the kinds of responsibility you can expect a child to bear. If you're bad at money management and have brought a child into the world that you actually can't afford to raise, and you are not meeting their basic needs because of that, it's not on your child to solve that problem. That's on you.",

Sure, if by innocence you mean they don't know about death or financial matters, or that they believe in Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy, then I agree with you.

            " I'm struggling to understand your view here because it feels inadequately defined.  There's no clear definition of innocence and you directly state that you wouldn't say anything that's detrimental to the child or which the child cannot understand.  So what's left?  Are you basically arguing that we ought to teach our children things they are capable of learning?  That's what a lot of educators already think, and it's basically the concept of the Zone of Proximal Development.  If your view is that we should make an effort to teach children *all the things* they are capable of learning, that goes against current thinking.  Overloading a child with information and concepts isn't beneficial to them, even when your goal is to prepare them for school and/or \"the real world.\"",

Adjust based on age and maturity. * Then there's the full disclosure method, where the kids are told in no uncertain terms that grandma thinks it's 1972 and doesn't know that they exist, so she'll probably confuse you for your dad.

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: Pet ownership should be strictly regulated and licensed; a prospective owner should be required to demonstrate their ability to care for an animal before a pet license is granted and an animal is purchased or (ideally) adopted. Hi folks.  I think it's commonly acknowledged that many pet owners are not fit to properly care for their animal.  Quite aside from active abuse, there is significant passive abuse that has been normalised in western cultures, e.g.:  * Leaving co-dependent pets locked alone in small spaces for much of the day * Providing poor quality, excessive or insufficiently varied diets * Providing insufficient mental or physical exercise * Raising animals in conditions that are antithetical to their natural environment (this is a little subjective, perhaps) * Selling or giving away co-dependent pets when they no longer \"fit for purpose\"  So my dangerous idea, that seems to be quite unpopular amongst everyone I've talked to, is that pet ownership should be regulated and licensed in much the same way as human adoption. It seems odd to me that we bring these animals into our lives to raise them, essentially, as our children, but we don't seem to confer on them the same living conditions as we would a child.  This view does not necessarily cover service or working animals, that's a whole different matter.  Why do I want my view changed? Two reasons:  1. I have locked horns with some of my pet-owning friends about this; their argument being that such regulations would restrict their freedom to own a thing that they want (which is precisely the point). I want to understand where they're coming from, and either they don't have the patience to articulate it in terms I can understand, or I don't have the patience to understand how they've articulated it. I'm not sure which. 2. I would really love to get a dog or cat as a companion animal, but as a city dwelling, working single person, I feel very far from being able to morally do so considering the above. If it were my job to set the terms on which a \"pet license\" is granted, my current lifestyle (and that of most city-dwelling single folks) would not pass muster. **That said, please keep in mind that my CMV appeal is about the wider issue of pet ownership, not my view that I shouldn't get a dog**.  Thanks for reading, I'll try to engage as best I can. :)\n\nAssistant:": {

So who's license should I buy? Customs officers want to know that a dog has had a rabies shot, apart from that there are no universal rules, people are free to go where they want with their dog.

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: Conscription has no place in civilised society. Or any society for that matter. I inherently disagree with war but unfortunately it seems to be something that will never go away, maybe I\u2019m wrong. The government should not be able to infringe on your civil liberties and make you fight, possibly to your death for your government for a war you may not support, then leave you traumatised for life with little to no support. There are still many counties in the developed world where conscription is a thing like Finland, Italy, Japan, Switzerland and France to name a few. We speak about civil liberties and human rights but conscription by its nature infringes our right to life\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Here are a couple of things to consider.  First, when a country has conscription it makes it much more difficult to go to war.  This is because a huge segment of the population will be involved and dead young men and usually not very popular.  Notice that most powerful and militarily active country in the world, the United States, does not have conscription.  This is a direct result of the Vietnam War which was massively unpopular.  The U.S. did not abandon poorly conceived military adventurism, however, as you probably noticed.  They just created and all volunteer force to wage wars.  The result, twenty year long conflicts in the Middle East that the average American barely cares about.  This would not be possible if the U.S. had a conscript army.  Secondly, notice who joins the military.  It is largely people with poor education and blacks and people of Hispanic origin are over represented.   So, essentially the U.S. is getting the poorest and most at risk members of its population to do the most dangerous work.  Were the U.S. to reintroduce compulsory conscription, it would be a great equalizer.  The sons and (possibly) daughters of the most affluent and privileged would literally rub shoulders with the most marginalized.  I could imagine that would do a lot to decrease the polarization that the U.S. is currently experiencing.  This will not happen, however.

    "\n\nHuman: Change my view thatFemale Dating Strategy feels like the woman version of neck beards/Incels. I just stumbled upon the FDS community and the posts there are just utterly terrifying. The expectations and \u201crules\u201d of dating are next to impossible. The entire subreddit is toxic and enabling to woman of all ages. They created these abbreviations of how they view men, and see themselves as \u201cbetter\u201d than men in some way. I\u2019ve went through numerous posts and read through the comments, that is why I created this post. I would like to see if my view can be changed on this subreddit or Reddit agrees with me and believes this is just as terrifying/Incel like behavior as well. These woman create their own barriers for dating and then wonder why they end up single or hated by these \u201cmen\u201d that they see. I believe there are deep rooted cause, that may be behaviorally driven or emotionally driven, maybe traumas were involved. As an ex-mental health clinician I think some of these subscribers to that subreddit need professional help (not trying to be rude or disrespectful). CMV\n\nAssistant:": {

            " I agree with you that some of the people on that sub should be seeking professional help, and that certain parts of their ideology are pretty fucked. That's the case for a lot of \"advice\" subreddits. I won't try to change your opinion on that because I think you're right; instead, I'll try to convince you that the ideology has some merit and is not entirely predatory/toxic.   First: FDS evolved in direct response to the redpill/pick-up-artist movement, meaning it is a reaction to a specific threat: men who see women as objects, children, and/or targets of conquest. These guys inarguably exist, they suck, and at their worst (as mentioned by other posters) they are dangerous. So, while the redpill/PUA circles were created to fan the flames of fragile, isolated male egos, FDS was created to respond to that fire, which is demonstrably damaging to women. This does not make FDS inherently beneficial, but it does distinguish it from the guy versions.  Second: FDS is specifically intended for cis-het women seeking committed, long-term relationships. The name is something of a misnomer, as it's not really intended for \"dating\" in general--a more accurate name might be \"Cis-het Female Mate-Finding Strategy.\" If you're fine with casual sex or don't fit into typical gender norms, their rules won't be useful to you. If you're looking for a faithful guy to marry, it probably is a good idea to take it slow and avoid dudes who frequent prostitutes, have porn addictions, or are texting 60 girls from Tinder. (I also think their views on sex workers, trans people, and BDSM are pretty fucked; that doesn't change the fact that some of this advice could still be useful.)

It actually used to be illegal in the US but as of 2005 you can now buy it   The reason salt and pepper came to grace restaurant tables with all those other spices out there is **French cooking and Louis XIV. **  At the time that formal dining came into fashion, French culture was influential throughout the western world. Louis XIV was an influential man as the king of France. He didn't like as much salt or pepper in his food but others did so he created the custom of having his chefs put it on the table rather than cooked in. The custom spread and western culture helped spread it all over the world.   Edit: black pepper contains piperine not capsaicin.  Edit 2: Chinese is hard. La (not Lada) and Ma are more nuanced and appear to refer to different things. La is the word spicy generically. And by region (Hunan vs Szechuan) Ma la refers to the numbing spice (that I described as electric feeling) see the comments below for detail.",

            " I remember reading the correct answer to this about 6 months ago.  Hold my beer while I butcher it.  Salt suppresses bitter tastes/unpleasant flavours in a lot (all?) foods. Which gives a more balanced flavour which humans like. You can add a small amount to coffee beans that are a bit old to negate the \"old and bitter\" flavour coffee gets later on.  Given the choice, we'll tolerate something that's too salty over something that's too bitter.

It actually used to be illegal in the US but as of 2005 you can now buy it   The reason salt and pepper came to grace restaurant tables with all those other spices out there is **French cooking and Louis XIV. **  At the time that formal dining came into fashion, French culture was influential throughout the western world. Louis XIV was an influential man as the king of France. He didn't like as much salt or pepper in his food but others did so he created the custom of having his chefs put it on the table rather than cooked in. The custom spread and western culture helped spread it all over the world.   Edit: black pepper contains piperine not capsaicin.  Edit 2: Chinese is hard. La (not Lada) and Ma are more nuanced and appear to refer to different things. La is the word spicy generically. And by region (Hunan vs Szechuan) Ma la refers to the numbing spice (that I described as electric feeling) see the comments below for detail.",
        "rejected_target": " Mainly because of 3 reasons.  * 1) Salt and Pepper are both fairly ubiquitous, being among some of the most abundant resources known to man. Salt, makes up much of our water, and is easy to de-salinate from water and then use, or mine from vast salt mines. Pepper, in it's various forms and incarnations, is fairly robust a plant and has many varieties that make them easily grown in most climates without many issues. * 2) They are some of the best spices known. Salt and pepper usually take very little to alter flavors of the food they are added to. Salt is usually tastable by humans by as little as 1 part per 1 million, and pepper at the most mild of capsacin levels can be tasted at around 1 part per 10,000. Both spices can be used at relatively small quantities that provide significant effects on the food it's used on.  * 3) Mainly salt on it's ability to perserve foods. Salt has been used for millenia to dry and perserve foods. Running pepper in with it helps add flavoring to an otherwise VERY salty piece of meat once it's treated and produced."

Imagine this: We know nothing about you and we show an advertisement on Channel 6 at 7.30PM for a Simon & Garfunkel concert.  What are the chances you're going to engage?  Now imagine we know you like cars, specifically BMWs, more specifically black BMW SUVs AND we know you live in Vancouver. What's the likelyhood of you opening an ad/article that shows a black BMW SUV and dealership info for Vancouver?  But that's half the equation: your profile. Now we need to learn the other half: when/how you engage. Could we infer that you are likely commuting if you open emails & play mobile games on a mobile device at 7.30-8.30 AM each day? What would we learn about you if you watched 90% of a BMW review video, only 20% of a Volvo review and didn't read any articles on any cars.  Now we can make assumptions about the when and how.  Can you imagine how likely you be to engage with us if we knew all this stuff? We know 'who' you are, what you want and when/how to put it in your face. That's why your data is collected.  Now add a 3rd dimesion: Your emotional state. What if we knew how you are feeling and in the right frame of mind you'd be in to consume our content/ad/products?  Eg. Could we infer that when you are on dating apps that you're feeling lonely? Tinder did.

    "\n\nHuman: Explain like I'm five years old: Why are so many old websites hosted at universities like MIT? I Googled for the lyrics to \"You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch\" and up came this ancient HTML document from the days of Web 2.0.  I've noticed that Google will often point me to these very old, rudimentary webpages that are 20 years old or so, and often hosted at American universities like MIT.

            " Several things lined up in the early days of computing where it just made sense.   * Universities being at the forefront of science, meant they had alot of computer science researchers doing research on the bounds of computing. This meant they had the latest and greatest computers for the time. * The internet was formed as a research in trying to understand the best ways to link multiple computers together. Eventually as this research grew, multiple universities worked together to try and test how far this idea could go.  *  HTML is just a normal text file that is designed to be read and understood by a web browser. Text is ***CHEAP*** to store on a computer, even back when computers took up entire rooms. When compared to something like a single image, you can store thousands of lines of text and be far more information dense.   * Early day web hosting was far less difficult to manage as both the total users expected and complexity was far simpler. Serving 92kB of text to 100 people vs 4k video 500k users, are 2 completely different problems. Since the university would already have a webpage, and all of the infrastructure has already been paid for web hosting. It was basically free to offer a folder that people can place files into where they would be served to anyone on the internet.   As time has progressed, it has only become easier and cheaper to host those webpages due to moorses law. That $100k dollar server they started hosting on, could be replaced with a $30 raspberry pi and no one would be able to tell the difference.",

Others who misclicked or dont enjoy it can just return and not request that many infos from the server. If a server experiences heavy load and more requests than it can handle you change your website in a way that decreases it.    PS: This is just a guess. But ads don't usually pay more per page interaction, the advertiser still pays for the same amount of appearance. Unless the page completely refreshes or renews after pressing the button the pageowners don't get a benefit so in this case it would be smarter for them to show all the ads in the beginning to not risk potential readers to not click the \"continue reading\" button in order for the ad to show - they would straight up show the ad to make more net-profit.",

The main purpose of this is to slow the vehicle down without using the breaks (extended use of the breaks can cause them to heat up and eventually fail).  There are two different methods of using the engine to break. Engine breaks, which open cylinder valves at a different timing, allowing the engine to waste work rather than generate it. The second option is the use of a Jake Break, which is basically a valve that restricts the exhaust flow, resulting in the wasting of work.  In order for either system to work the truck needs to be in the correct gear which results in downshifting while slowing down.",

Normally adding gas and spark causes little explosions inside the engine, which force it to turn and move the truck.   When you stop adding gas to the engine it slows down as fast and as much as it can. If it is connected to the wheels of the truck (in gear, clutch disengaged), it will slow down the truck as well. Which gear the driver has the truck in will determine how effective the engine can slow the truck down, lower gears working better (and being louder).   I read the assignment.",

            " To understand what happens you need to understand how an engine works:    * The piston moves down, sucking in air and fuel.  * The piston moves up, compressing the air and fuel to a very high pressure.  This obviously requires quite a bit of force to compress the air that much.  * The compressed air and fuel are ignited, resulting in heat and gases from burning that have an even higher pressure than what was previously compressed.  This pushes the piston down, with a very high force.  * Valves open to let the smoke out and the piston moves back up to push all the smoke out.  Then the cycle repeats.  So basically what you have in an engine is multiple cylinders, with one piston in the process of the explosion that creates so much force, and the other cylinders in the process of using some of that force to compress the air and fuel that they have in the cylinder.  If you cut the fuel to the engine, there will be no explosions and no force being generated, but all of the compression of the air still happens, so bottom line you have to manually put a lot of force into trying to turn an engine by hand, because of all the compression that happens inside.  So semi trucks use that for braking.  They keep the transmission \"locked\" into a lower gear so that the wheels are forced to keep turning the engine, and the huge resistance from the compression phase in all the cylinders can act as a huge brake and slow down the truck."

So basically what you have in an engine is multiple cylinders, with one piston in the process of the explosion that creates so much force, and the other cylinders in the process of using some of that force to compress the air and fuel that they have in the cylinder.  If you cut the fuel to the engine, there will be no explosions and no force being generated, but all of the compression of the air still happens, so bottom line you have to manually put a lot of force into trying to turn an engine by hand, because of all the compression that happens inside.  So semi trucks use that for braking.  They keep the transmission \"locked\" into a lower gear so that the wheels are forced to keep turning the engine, and the huge resistance from the compression phase in all the cylinders can act as a huge brake and slow down the truck."

But very few disputes go to this level.  However in most cases people will still have some sort of relationship with their former employer after they have left. Either as a referance when getting new jobs, returning to the job, conducting business with them or interact with others who have also left the job. So hurting the relationship with them can be bad in the long run."

It\u2019s more advanced than Hubble, so is able to see more interesting wavelengths of light, and is more precise than Hubble is capable of.   Another important part of all this is that while the Hubble telescope was in Low earth orbit (similar to the ISS) at an altitude of about 550 km, the James Webb Telescope will be over 200,000Km away from earth, at the L2 Lagrange point.

Also, lost track of what sub I was in and made this not very Explain like I'm five years old.  Sorry.  Internal computer memory (RAM or Random Access Memory) is built and accessed in multiples and powers of two (binary).  You still buy computer memory sticks in capacities like 512 MB or 2 GB.  These aren't really \"real\" mega- and giga-bytes because in the old days computer people borrowed some metric terms like kilo that meant exactly 1000 and used them as a shorthand to refer to 1024.  Even today, some operating systems and programs (and programmers) still use the \"wrong\" 1024 value when calculating both computer memory and storage.  When computer hard disk drives were invented, they weren't electronic structures built on powers of two, so the marketing people used the \"correct\" multiples of 1000 when talking about storage capacity (decimal).  If nothing else, it makes the capacity look slightly bigger, and marketing always likes bigger.  Marketing also really likes round numbers.  So hard disk drives are advertised in terms like 250 GB or 2 TB.  Solid state drives are internally more structured like computer memory (built in binary) than mechanical hard disks (measured in decimal for convenience).  A 240 GB SSD probably has a \"raw\" storage capacity more like 256x1024x1024x1024 bytes (and 8x that many bits).  So why not call it 256 GB (using the old binary method) or even 275 GB (using the newer decimal method) SSD?  Again, marketing people like round numbers.  Also, the buying public (as opposed to just computer geeks) has figured out that hard drives never seem to have the full storage capacity that is advertised.  With old mechanical disks, this was mostly due to the binary/decimal measuring difference.  With SSDs, it's mostly due to something called over-provisioning.  So, the marketing people pick a smaller round number that more or less reasonably reflects the actual usable space.  Over-provisioning is when some of the SSD storage capacity is marked as off limits right from the get go.  Your 256 GB SSD has 16 GB set aside for future use, leaving 240.  If the SSD internal control electronics notices that sector 18 (for example) is developing a fault, it will copy the information to a new sector in the 16 GB.  Old sector 18 will be permanently disabled.  The new sector 18 will be marked as in use.  The SSD's total amount of storage, as reported to the end user, remains the same at 240.  A 480 GB SSD is probably a 512 GB SSD with 32 GB of over-provisioning.    I just did a quick search on Amazon and I see 240 GB, 250 GB, 256 GB, and 275 GB SSDs from different manufacturers which I'm pretty sure all have the same amount of actual storage, so it's not like the marketing people are consistent.  edit: some numbers formatting",
            " SSDs are composed of multiple flash chips, which are produced in sizes power of two. Why? These chips come with a number of pins called an address bus, naturally allowing for 2^N different addresses. When combining chips to form a bigger chip, you'd prefer it if these address busses combined to form one contiguous adress space (without holes, addresses you aren't allowed to use)  For harddisks, this simply doesn't matter.  EDIT: Oh, right, you mentioned 240 and 480. That would be due to extra backup space needed for when parts of chips fail, as extra buffer to move things around, or for wear levelling.",
            " It's called \"Over-Provisioning\". SSD technology limits the number of times each storage \"unit\" can be written to. So if some \"unit\" has already too much writes the drive can use this over-provisioned space to compensate. It's actually more on-the-fly but that is the general idea.",

Over-provisioning is when some of the SSD storage capacity is marked as off limits right from the get go.  Your 256 GB SSD has 16 GB set aside for future use, leaving 240.  If the SSD internal control electronics notices that sector 18 (for example) is developing a fault, it will copy the information to a new sector in the 16 GB.  Old sector 18 will be permanently disabled.  The new sector 18 will be marked as in use.  The SSD's total amount of storage, as reported to the end user, remains the same at 240.  A 480 GB SSD is probably a 512 GB SSD with 32 GB of over-provisioning.    I just did a quick search on Amazon and I see 240 GB, 250 GB, 256 GB, and 275 GB SSDs from different manufacturers which I'm pretty sure all have the same amount of actual storage, so it's not like the marketing people are consistent.  edit: some numbers formatting",

Let's say I have 256GB.   1) **HDDs and 250**: This is still a piece of paper with 256 lines / a drive with 256 GB. But, the marketing is done either by or for people who aren't particularly tech-savvy: 250 is a nice round number and 256 is not. \"250 lines on this piece of paper!\" vs \"256 lines on this piece of paper!\". 250 sounds nicer.

So maybe out of those 256 lines, there are actually only 240 lines on the paper that you're allowed to use here; the other 16 are extra lines (in case you're writing something and it goes over the last line - it has to go somewhere, so we write the overflow on line 241), or backup lines (oops, let's say you just tore the paper or spilled ink on line 194, let's copy everything on line 194 over to line 242), or just lines to make an index - so maybe lines 243-247 are taken up to say, \"She has the grocery list on line 210\".

        "sft_target": " tl;dr: Marketing, false advertising, GB as used by computer geek vs GB as used by rest of the world, and hidden reserve to make the drive run faster and have a safety buffer in case of failure.  Also, lost track of what sub I was in and made this not very Explain like I'm five years old.  Sorry.  Internal computer memory (RAM or Random Access Memory) is built and accessed in multiples and powers of two (binary).  You still buy computer memory sticks in capacities like 512 MB or 2 GB.  These aren't really \"real\" mega- and giga-bytes because in the old days computer people borrowed some metric terms like kilo that meant exactly 1000 and used them as a shorthand to refer to 1024.  Even today, some operating systems and programs (and programmers) still use the \"wrong\" 1024 value when calculating both computer memory and storage.  When computer hard disk drives were invented, they weren't electronic structures built on powers of two, so the marketing people used the \"correct\" multiples of 1000 when talking about storage capacity (decimal).  If nothing else, it makes the capacity look slightly bigger, and marketing always likes bigger.  Marketing also really likes round numbers.  So hard disk drives are advertised in terms like 250 GB or 2 TB.  Solid state drives are internally more structured like computer memory (built in binary) than mechanical hard disks (measured in decimal for convenience).  A 240 GB SSD probably has a \"raw\" storage capacity more like 256x1024x1024x1024 bytes (and 8x that many bits).  So why not call it 256 GB (using the old binary method) or even 275 GB (using the newer decimal method) SSD?  Again, marketing people like round numbers.  Also, the buying public (as opposed to just computer geeks) has figured out that hard drives never seem to have the full storage capacity that is advertised.  With old mechanical disks, this was mostly due to the binary/decimal measuring difference.  With SSDs, it's mostly due to something called over-provisioning.  So, the marketing people pick a smaller round number that more or less reasonably reflects the actual usable space.

Their bodies are a less tightly regulated (homeostatic) than ours; like, consider that they're cold-blooded and we aren't. Something going wrong with a mammal's internal regulation is just much more likely to cause a cascade of failures, leading to death.

Removing the fat, connective tissue, silver skin, bone and hair during processing lessens the 'gamey' taste.

It has to do with the diet of the animal being far more varied in wild animals (you are what you eat).  Wild animals eat a ton of random roughage, berries, roots and plants while domesticated animals eat mostly corn and silage.  There are other threads you can search for on eli5 which corroborate this. Here's a quote from the University of Michigan  > Venison refers to the meat of antlered animals such as deer, moose, elk and caribou. The 'wild' flavor of venison is directly related to what the animal eats. Corn fed deer will have a milder flavor than those that eat acorns or sage. The 'gamey' flavor is more noticeable in the fat. Removing the fat, connective tissue, silver skin, bone and hair during processing lessens the 'gamey' taste. However, undesirable strong flavors are due to inadequate bleeding, delay in field dressing or failure to cool the carcass promptly  https://www.extension.umn.edu/food/food-safety/preserving/meat-fish/gamey-flavor-and-cooking-venison/",

Then in the late 19th century, the British won the bid to build the first Japanese railway system. So the Brits made all the train tracks run on the left side as well, because that's how the British system worked. In 1924, an official law was passed to codify that all traffic in Japan, on rails or roads, needs to go on the left.",

            " \"Sugar\" is a slightly problematic term, because it is a term for a class of compounds.   Table sugar, which is normally what we have around, is sucrose, which is made up of two simple sugars stuck together. Your body has no issue splitting them up, so each molecule of sucrose becomes 1 glucose and 1 fructose.  Most sweet foods contain either sucrose directly, or \"high fructose corn syrup\" which, is a mixture of fructose and glucose all mixed together.  Carbs are mostly just long chains of glucose, and enzymes happily cleave off glucose from the chains and use it. So carbs become sugar, but mostly, become glucose. This is energy for the whole body, every cell.  The difference comes with fructose.... remember the sucrose is a source of it.... When your liver processes sugars, it makes fats and cholesterol. This is \"de novo lipogenysis\" which is just the fancy latin way of saying \"the creation of new fat\".  The thing is, remember how I said glucose is food for your whole body? Because of that, only a small percentage <10% ever gets processed by the liver.  Fructose however is not an energy source for every cell. Fructose is processed in the liver, and 90% of it goes there. Fructolysis is the process: > Unlike glucose, which is directly metabolized widely in the body, fructose is almost entirely metabolized in the liver in humans, where it is directed toward replenishment of liver glycogen and triglyceride synthesis.[1] Under one percent of ingested fructose is directly converted to plasma triglyceride.[2] 29% - 54% of fructose is converted in liver to glucose, and about a quarter of fructose is converted to lactate. 15% - 18% is converted to glycogen.[3] Glucose and lactate are then used normally as energy to fuel cells all over the body.[2]",
            " What does it mean \"unhealthy\" exactly? It's a very vague term. A tablespoon of sugar is just too much sugar to be used immediately by the average human, so most of it becomes stored as fat. If that is what you consider unhealthy, then yes, it's unhealthy. But if you need the carbohydrates, because you are doing heavy work, then a tablespoon of sugar is \"fine\".",
            " Not all carbs do.  Some fibers get broken down to component parts only by the bacteria in your colon, at the very end of the digestive tract.  Others are somewhere in the middle but are still used mainly by bacteria without resulting in sugars that get absorbed.  These bacteria are very important for your digestive and nervous systems as a whole.",

Most sweet foods contain either sucrose directly, or \"high fructose corn syrup\" which, is a mixture of fructose and glucose all mixed together.  Carbs are mostly just long chains of glucose, and enzymes happily cleave off glucose from the chains and use it. So carbs become sugar, but mostly, become glucose.

Because of that, only a small percentage <10% ever gets processed by the liver.  Fructose however is not an energy source for every cell. Fructose is processed in the liver, and 90% of it goes there. Fructolysis is the process: > Unlike glucose, which is directly metabolized widely in the body, fructose is almost entirely metabolized in the liver in humans, where it is directed toward replenishment of liver glycogen and triglyceride synthesis.[1] Under one percent of ingested fructose is directly converted to plasma triglyceride.[2] 29% - 54% of fructose is converted in liver to glucose, and about a quarter of fructose is converted to lactate. 15% - 18% is converted to glycogen.[3] Glucose and lactate are then used normally as energy to fuel cells all over the body.[2]"

A tablespoon of sugar is just too much sugar to be used immediately by the average human, so most of it becomes stored as fat. If that is what you consider unhealthy, then yes, it's unhealthy. But if you need the carbohydrates, because you are doing heavy work, then a tablespoon of sugar is \"fine\"."

            " Rolling blackouts become necessary when there is far more demand than supply of electric power.  In developed countries with stable and reliable grids they are rare, but in places where the infrastructure is not really fit for purpose you may end up in situations where there is more demand for electricity than you can supply with the power plants you have.  Normally you have vast interconnected power grids where these things can be even out across many different countries and also have power plants that stand by and can be brought online to make up for the shortfall.  In some cases such as isolated power grids on islands, places with poorly maintained infrastructure and developing countries you may find yourself in a situation where there simply is not more power to be had.  If the operators in this case the operators have a choice. If they do nothing, physics happen, the frequency of the electricity on the grid goes down and either breaks a lot of stuff or causes things to automatically shut down to prevent being broken. This would mean no electricity for anyone for a long time.  The other choice is to cut of some customers until the remaining demand matches what you can supply. Critical infrastructure like hospitals etc and things necessary to keep the grid itself running are not going to be cut of.  You could either pick a neighborhood to have no power for a day or you can pick 24 neighborhoods to have no power for an hour each one after the other to lessen the misery by spreading it around.  That is a rolling blackout. The are that gets blacked out rolls around and affects most people for a short time.  It is not good but better then the alternative.  However many people in many places especially ones where corruption is rampant will pointed out that poor neighborhoods seems to be more likely to be hit by that supposedly equal spread of the blackout.

            " Rolling blackouts happen when the energy demands on the grid cannot be sustained by the grid production. So, a small portion of the grid shuts off to reduce overall demand. They represent a LOSS of money by energy companies, not a net gain. This is because there is demand they are not fulfilling, meaning they are losing sales.  Balencing a grid is very difficult, because production needs to exactly equal demand as much as possible. You don't want to waste money producing excess electricity, but you also want to meet the demand levels. This Balencing act is very complicated, and places many demands on the grid (such as peak demand plants that are only intended to operate during times of the highest levels of consumption).",

Electricity is billed based on the amount you use, and if you can't use it (because there's no power), then the power company doesn't make money.  A rolling blackout happens when the power company can't provide enough power to everyone that wants it, so some people don't get it. The power company realizes that people and businesses need electricity, so they shut off one group for a while, then another group, so everyone gets a turn with some electricity.",

Shortly after, when I was about 15, a family court judge granted me right of self-determination due to the trauma he had put me through (domestic violence, exposure to pornographic material, verbal, mental and emotional abuse on too many occasions to list).  Since that time, I maybe spoke to him once or twice.  We have not exchanged words in a decade.  Out of his four children, only one of them is in contact with him - he was much younger than I was and had a different parental experience.  I have requested many times that this brother and his wife do not tell our father about my personal life.  And yet, they have told him personal details about my relationships, my job, etc.  I went no contact with them, but they still receive information through my mom.  The chain of fuckery goes like this : ME > MOM > BROTHER > STALKER.  This week he sent a completely unhinged letter to my work address, where it was received and opened by a coworker.  (It's a government office and pretty routine for us to receive personally addressed mail due to the calls we get, so this isn't surprising or out of the scope of their job).  It has a lot of personal information in it, and while my coworker said she didn't read it, it's possible that she did or others did - it is my belief he did this in an attempt to injure me professionally.  He knows  I don't want any contact with him, but every once in a while he pops up like a herpes sore to send me some reminder that if he wants, he can find me no matter where I go in the country.  I'm filing a police report and a TPO, but I doubt the TPO will be granted because his physical violence and abuse took place 20 years ago and because my mother is so conflict-avoidant it went undocumented by police.  Also, I live in NV and he lives in VA  I need some guidance on how to protect myself from my father, my brother and maybe even my mom.  I don't want to go no contact with her but it's on the table after twenty years of just wanting to be left alone to have a normal life without my abuser in it.  What can I do?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Landlord thinks my house is his Y\u2019all. I\u2019m so annoyed. we\u2019ve been living in our new place for less than a full week and our landlord has popped up over here and tried to just walk in with his key three times. Today I drove up just as he was unlocking our door to walk in and I\u2019m just like \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d   The first time I walked out of my bedroom up to see him just standing in my living room looking at my thermostat. Literally didn\u2019t even acknowledge the fact that he was in the unit like by saying \u201canyone home\u201d or anything. I was about to pepper spray the fuck out of him because his back was to me and I was home alone.   Today he said he needed to do maintenance on the a/c and proceeded to crane his neck to look in every room with a door open and rummage through my cabinets in my kitchen.   I really don\u2019t wanna be THAT tenant but I can\u2019t do this for a year. It\u2019s always just him telling me some small shit that could have been said over the phone. The anxiety of thinking someone is in my house when I\u2019m not home is too much. I\u2019ve rented since I was 18 and never had a landlord who just pops up at all hours of the day.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " &#x200B;  OP I don't see a state and landlord/tenant law can get pretty state specific so most of what I can offer you is broad strokes.   1) Generally speaking a landlord has to give you 24 hours notice before entering into the dwelling. Violations like this, at least in my state and I'm sure other ones, can be a cause to break the lease. In my state you can only recover actual damages though from these kinds of intrusions. Although I am certain that a crafty attorney could plead other damages if you wanted to go the lawsuit route.   2) Zonk gives some good advice about going through your lease, just double check what you signed and make sure that you didn't agree to any ridiculous terms. I'm not sure calling the police on your landlord is going to be an exemplary idea, but if you are worried it might escalate definitely call the cops first and worry about your relationship with the landlord later.   3) Please do not assault your landlord. He might not have a legal right to be there when he hasn't gone through the proper procedures but that doesn't mean that he won't try and slap you with assault charges or try and perform some form of illegal eviction that will just be a massive headache for you.   4) Finally, express to him next time you see him that you do not want him coming into the dwelling without notice, it would be a good idea to write him a letter/email too and make sure you have a copy. Try and document any interactions you have with him with both physical and electronic copies. These serve to prove that the landlord had notice of the lease violation and helps document how many times it occurred.   Best of luck.",

            " I'm confused - how does your LL know to do maintenance on the A/C without you calling in and letting him know there's a problem?  (I am assuming you did not call in a problem based on your post).     The fact that he comes in and looks into your rooms is also suggestive he's more nosy than there to provide a service.  BEcause you don't mention where you live, your rights may vary with respect to notice, as others have noted. You should check the terms of your lease for specifics.  In addition, you are entitled to a \"quiet enjoyment\" in the home you rent: that means it's YOUR home and the LL cannot just enter the property without notice absent an emergency.  Typically, this covenant is implied into leases (where it is not explicitly stated) but not all states imply the covenant of quiet enjoyment into the lease (e.g. it must be written into the document).  repeated breaches of the covenant of quiet enjoyment (without excuse) *could* give you the option to terminate the lease (also, depending on your state).       I agree the best course of action is to send LL a letter (certified mail return receipt requested) or email (bcc yourself) politely asking LL to stop entering the unit without prior permission and/or full notice of when he's coming over b/c it's *your home now.*  Obviously, emergencies are different things, but this sounds more like a nosy LL that could lead to something worse.     Good luck",
            " First, tell him to stop showing up and give you the notice required by your state. He sounds like a nosy guy/pervert who wants access to your personal life, or to see you naked.  Get cameras. Also, get gate hooks for the doors when you're home.   Check for cameras.",

I\u2019m so annoyed. we\u2019ve been living in our new place for less than a full week and our landlord has popped up over here and tried to just walk in with his key three times. Today I drove up just as he was unlocking our door to walk in and I\u2019m just like \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d  >  > The first time I walked out of my bedroom up to see him just standing in my living room looking at my thermostat. Literally didn\u2019t even acknowledge the fact that he was in the unit like by saying \u201canyone home\u201d or anything. I was about to pepper spray the fuck out of him because his back was to me and I was home alone.  >  > Today he said he needed to do maintenance on the a/c and proceeded to crane his neck to look in every room with a door open and rummage through my cabinets in my kitchen.  >  > I really don\u2019t wanna be THAT tenant but I can\u2019t do this for a year. It\u2019s always just him telling me some small shit that could have been said over the phone. The anxiety of thinking someone is in my house when I\u2019m not home is too much.

    "\n\nHuman: Sheriff's deputy is renting from me, refuses to remove his dog and is now making threats (Texas) I own and manage a small apartment building (6 units).  One is for my family, one is for my in-laws, and the other 4 are rented to paying tenants.    Our lease clearly says no pets are allowed except service dogs.  However, one of my tenants, who happens to be a sheriff's deputy, obtained two small dogs (I believe they are chihuahuas) last month.  My in-laws, who live next to them, started complaining about barking.  So I sent them a notice saying they have 30 days to either rehome the dogs, or they can end their lease if they desire.    He texted me and said can we meet to discuss this situation.  So I said sure, come over to my apartment.  I thought he was going to claim they are service dogs or something.  But when he came over, he was in normal non-uniform clothes, but wearing his gun.  He walked into my apartment and said something like this: look, I don't really care what the lease says, my wife got these dogs and I'm not going to make her remove them.  I said I'm sorry it doesn't work that way, you have to follow the lease.  Then he put his hand on his gun, and said if you want to make an issue of this, there will be serious consequences.  I was kind of shocked and didn't say anything, and he left.    Now I'm not really sure what to do, to be honest I don't feel safe with him around, but I don't want to piss him off and cause problems for myself either.  If anyone has any advice please tell me how to proceed.\n\nAssistant:": {

You\u2019re lucky it wasn\u2019t a teenager on a joyride or someone actually trying to steal it because cars rarely get recovered in the same condition it\u2019s stolen, even if it was just used for a crime and dumped, they usually trash the car to hide evidence.

If she kept it in a garage for 3 weeks she probably had no need to lock it or just thought the remote didn\u2019t work but when she gets inside it always started so there\u2019s little reason to believe it wasn\u2019t the right car.",

            " I think the issue here is that the post is marked as criminal law.  Criminally, if the facts are as you say, there is no case because it was an honest mistake.  However, just because there is no crime does not mean you cannot be compensated.  In California for example, mistake is NOT a defense to the tort of conversion.  This person took your property and deprived you of it for 3 weeks.  You therefore could be entitled to 3 weeks fair rental value of the vehicle - the amount of value she deprived you of (albeit negligently).    Of course, not every state follows the same rules, and there is no point suing someone who has no mo ey to go after, so make sure to talk to a lawyer in your state before deciding.  Cya disclaimer: Although I am a lawyer (in California) I am not YOUR lawyer.  This post is legal information o ly and not legal advice.

            " It would depend on where you are and the entirety of the situation. Where I live honest mistakes are generally not crimes. The most common example given for theft is the cellphone example. Lets say you place your cellphone down at a party. Another person has the exact same phone with a similar case and they pick up your phone thinking it is there's. They generally would not be liable for the theft as it was an honest mistake. Now if they end up dropping that phone and breaking the screen they can be liable in a civil suit for the damage to the phone. It hasn't been tested with a car but I bet the same printable would apply. If it's a same make model and color and can be easily mistaken for there car then no. However if they damaged that car they can be liable for damages. This all depends on the overall circumstances.",

Property managers who ghost you often have a change in attitude when you cc: your correspondence to the real, actual owners of the property.  You can look them up at your county recorder's office.  It's often an LLC or a trust, but you can Google the names you get and also search them out on your state's corporate registration website and places like US Search, Lexis-Nexis and Spokeo.

    "\n\nHuman: Police thought I was evading arrest, I just didn't want to stop car in the middle of nowhere... I'll keep this brief.  I was on a highway at 3am on Monday, coming home from my job that runs late into the night. I see a cop following me for a few minutes before he begins flashing the lights at me to pull over. Seeing as it was late, and there was basically no one else around, I didn't feel good about pulling over. I slowed down, put my blinkers on, and called 911. I asked the operator to let the cop know that I'd be pulling into the 24/7 Wal*Mart near my home. She claims she complied. The cop began to tailgate me.  It took fifteen minutes for me to get to the Wal*Mart. The cop arrested me for \"Second Degree Police Eluding\". He also suspected I was drunk but I passed my sobriety test. I also got a ticket for \"Reckless Driving\". My court date is around a month from now.   I spoke to an attorney, and asked if I could have the operator vouch for me. Apparently, she can't??? So now I have no proof that I *wasn't* evading police. Am I fucked now? If not that, what can I do to prove that I wasn't trying to outrun the cops?\n\nAssistant:": {

I had literally just gotten out of the shower so I answered them through my Ring.  They asked me if Jacob was home.  I am not Jacob.  I do not know anybody named Jacob.  I have lived here for almost 3 years.  Upon telling the officer this he said I needed to answer the door so he could see my face.  I explained once again I am not who they were looking for.  The officer then said he needed me to let him in so he could look for Jacob.  I said there is nobody here by that name and that I do not even know any Jacob.  The officer then hid off to the side of my porch for almost 20 minutes.  At this point the mailman walked by and put my mail in the box.  After he moved down the street the officer ***went to my mailbox and started reading off information on all the letters I had received into his radio.***  How the fuck is this not an absolute violation of my privacy?

    "\n\nHuman: Employer makes us pay several hundred dollars for parking, and keeps raising the rate. Is this legal? [KY] Parking is somewhat cramped at my employer, so all employees are charged over $350 a year for a \"parking benefit\". It's deducted from our pay-stubs just like health insurance or any other actual benefit.  This rate has increased significantly over the past few years, when the fee was first charged it was fifty or sixty dollars and only for seasonal visitors. But it has proven a significant source of income, and employees are now equally charged. My employer deflects all complaints by explaining that everyone in the organization pays, from the president on down. Which is true, but I imagine when you make $150k a year you really don't miss it.  Recently, most employees were promised a raise. However the *parking benefit* will also be increasing (in what is probably an equivalent amount but we're not sure yet). For most of us, this will negate the improved income, and I imagine a few people will actually be losing money.  Is this kosher, would we have any grounds to challenge this? If it matters, we are technically state employees.\n\nAssistant:": {

Parking would count an \"other facility\" which is customarily furnished by the employer, so perhaps your only angle here is to figure out if the deduction is limited to the employer's reasonable cost.

    "\n\nHuman: Public North Carolina High School. Says my son's hairstyle and color violates school's social norms. I was called to school today and was told that my son has been given a warning that his new hairstyle is against school's social norms. I asked for a copy of a document that describes the school's social norms which they did not provide, they instead said it's a matter of judgement by the school staff.  My son has long hair and has recently dyed it electric blue. He likes it this way. They told me that he has a week to change his hairstyle to an appropriate and acceptable hairstyle or he will be suspended until his hairstyle becomes acceptable. I told them that to me it seems like this is a matter of freedom of expression and the school needs to abide by the first amendment, they told me that there is no first amendment in schools and the freedom of expression of students is only as far as the school staff allow.  I'm not going to tell my son that he can't wear his favorite hairstyle and color only to appease the school administrators, unless they have a legal right in restricting his access to the school and education for his hairstyle.  What is the most reasonable course of action for us? First, is this a first amendment issue? And second, who do I talk to next?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Landlord won't fix malfunctioning fire alarm. It is destroying my quality of life. I am a tenant in Ohio staying in an apartment complex.   My room is on the bottom floor next to a machine room that houses elevator machinery and a boiler.   Beginning in September, a loud, 2-second pulse of a high pitch beep began going off every 8.5 seconds and it is followed by a higher-pitched but slightly quieter beep. The original beep is coming from the room next to mine and the secondary beep is coming from the fire alarm control panel near the entrance.   It is loud and you have to call somebody to shut it off. No maintenance is available after 5 pm or before 9am or on the weekends. So if it goes off in the evening, you have to hear it all night. If it goes off on a Friday night, you have to hear it all weekend. It prohibits me from sleeping, studying, and (I work from home) working in my apartment. I am a student at the University here and the invasiveness of this noise makes me go home every weekend so I can sleep in peace. it is so loud, due to it emanating from right next to my room, and high pitched that you can hear it with white noise playing, tv on, etc.  The frequency at which it is going off is increasing. It used to be once they shut it off it would be a week before it went off again. Now, it goes off again within the hour of them shutting it off. Sometimes, when they are called the maintenance people do not even show up because they are sick of it and I can hear them complaining about me in the hallway. I literally heard one of them say they don't know how to fix it.   I have been repeatedly lied to and/or mislead about the causes of this noise. At first, I was told it just happens sometimes. Then I was accused of vaping and setting it off (I quit vaping in June before I moved into the apartment and have never vaped or smoked in my apartment). Then I was told it is going off because other people are vaping in their apartments. Then I was told the boiler in the machine room is overheating and that is what is causing it.   And now I am being told that the smoke heads on the detector are faulty and they were replaced last week. The alarm went off all weekend and is going off again today.   However, the message on the fire alarm control panel says \"fire trouble\" a quick Google search of the system suggests that this is an electrical issue with the system. A post on the fire alarm subreddit had people telling me that it needs to be fixed by a certified technician not the apartment maintenance staff and that they likely are unaware of the root cause of the problem.   I was originally told they will move me to a new apartment if they cannot fix the issue. Then I was told they will not have any available units until January and they asked for more time to fix it and that in the mean time they will find me a unit in case they can't.   Today, I was told I am not being moved. And that the issue has been fixed. I had to come back with a recording to show them it is not and they acted confused.   I would like to be moved.  The lease states they will if there is cause and they already said they would move me before going back on it. My guess is they got a tenant for the unit they were going to move me to originally.  I would even consider breaking the lease and moving however rent has gone up in the area and leaving would represent a significant increase in monthly rent.  I called the fire Marshall and made an anonymous complaint. I would like to know what other remedies I can pursue on my own. What type of lawyer I should contact and what would they be able to do + any advice.   Thank you.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: (Utah) Found out yesterday my sister has endured domestic violence for years; need help knowing how to dispose properly of a gun in the house My sister told me yesterday that she called the cops on her husband who was in a violent rage. He did not hurt her or her two kids (ages 5 and 2.5) but physically destroyed several things around the house before she called the police. He was arrested and charged with domestic battery and destruction of property. There is currently a restraining order on him to stay away from her & the kids until his court hearing Monday.   I had no idea the extent of it because she kept it all from me (I live several states away so it wasn\u2019t all that difficult), but apparently his anger issues and destructive tendencies have been a reoccurring problem for basically their entire relationship (about 4 years). So this has not been a one-time incident, but rather hallmark DV over the course of several years.   Her husband has a gun (my sister thinks it\u2019s a Ruger 9mm but I don\u2019t know for sure) that my dad sold him within the state of Utah a couple years ago. According to my dad, no paperwork/registration was needed for a gun sale of that nature in the state of Utah. During the course of the DV, he would often threaten to shoot himself or harm himself with said gun. My sister told me she would hide it in various places around the house to keep him from getting to it, and would keep the ammo in a completely separate location from the gun. (I know how incredibly dangerous that is with two young kids, even if gun/ammo are separated. If I would have known...) She is incredibly fortunate (if that\u2019s even the word to use in this kind of situation) that no one has been seriously injured or hurt because of the gun [yet].  I know she needs to get the gun out of her house ASAP, but I also know that she needs to make sure it is 100% above the table and also won\u2019t have any repercussions on any future custody/divorce proceedings that could somehow weaken her case or chances at getting full custody of her child.   A few questions:  1. What\u2019s the best way to get rid of this gun? 2. Would there be any potential repercussions in divorce/legal proceedings if she sold a gun that was his?  3. Can she even sell it? Not having paperwork for a gun sale or not having to register it at all just seems really weird to me, but I know nothing about gun laws.  4. In the meantime, if she isn\u2019t able to get rid of it altogether, can she give it to a trusted friend for safekeeping until she can speak with a lawyer and figure out how to proceed?  He is a legal US resident but does not have citizenship (I don\u2019t know whether this affects anything, gun-wise or otherwise).\n\nAssistant:": {

But if the husband is convicted of a crime of domestic violence, and it he's currently subject to a domestic violence restraining order, he cannot possess a gun under federal law, and I'm sure the police would be happy to take custody of it.",

    "\n\nHuman: Bounty hunter broke into my house and intimidated me with a taser? Why do we allow this? I'm actually so disgusted right now. First of all, I live in Washington state. I recently moved into an apartment -- about a month and a half ago. Tonight, I had someone knock on my door with a camo tactical vest and a taser. Mind you, I wasn't aware at the time that he had these items. He was standing to the side of the peephole. When I opened the door he asked me, \"Is Amara there?\" I said, \"I have no idea who Amara is?\" He then proceeded to ask me other questions. I noticed the taser. That's when I said I don't have to answer your questions and shut the door in his face. Before the door shut he blasted into my apartment with his taser out. I called 911. He searched my premise. I then realized he was a bounty hunter. He never identified himself, nor did he have proper gear on. Which I know is against the law (but the officer didn't care because his partner had the right vest on. Which WASNT the one who entered my premise.) The girl who skipped bail didn't live at my address anymore. The only \"proof\" they have is that this is the residence she listed or last lived at. How is this okay? How is this acceptable? I'm a new fucking tenant. I didn't sign that stupid paper to get rid of my rights. The police said no crimes were committed and I didn't get to file any complaint (except the one that was generated automatically I assume?) Is there anything I can do? We frown at vigilantes yet we allow these thugs to run around and intimidate and harm innocent civilians. Bounty hunters are disgusting.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: My boyfriend was rear ended while traveling from one work location to another last night. Car at fault took off. Work won't let him take anymore days off. Last night my boyfriend got rear ended while driving from one work location to another. He works for a major gas station (think Exxon/Shell, etc) and was told to help out at another location that needed coverage.   During his drive, he was hit by another vehicle, who immediately took off. He chased her but eventually lost her after she got on the highway. He has a dashcam (front view only) so he has her license plate number. He stopped somewhere nearby and called the police. While waiting for the police, another car came by and said they witnessed the whole thing and tried to follow her but to no avail, though they did provide more of a description of the driver to the police officer once he arrived.  Since he was covering another location that night, he was told he didn't have any more available days off and worked the rest of the shift. After work, he went to urgent care on base nearby the house since he's in the reserves.    He had a ct scan done. Called up his insurance which says he has to pay a $500 deductible in regard to the car, but he hasn't called her insurance since his phone died. He was told to not go back to work for another 5 days, but he doesnt have anymore days available to get off, so hes going to work for the rest of his work week (Friday - Tuesday nights) I'm asking him to stay home, but he's adamant on working even though he keeps having back pains from an old injury he received while in the Navy that's now resurface because of this. He's currently asleep (just got home) so he hasn't called her insurance nor the gas stations corporate office about his accident.   Can there be anything done in regard to him staying home and possibly being fired, cost of medical and damage to car?   What can I do for him since he's leaving everything to insurance after he filed that police report? Is there anything we can do in this instance?  Location: Texas\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Airbnb host kicked off platform is threatening to sue me! Last month I reported an Airbnb host for sending me threatening messages and he has since been removed from the platform. Since then he has sent me a few disgruntled messages, the most recent of which threatened legal action for the loss of income related to being kicked off of both Airbnb and VRBO.  Just a few moments ago, I received an email from a lawyer representing the ex-Airbnb host. It is largely a  summary of events where the lawyer explains the situation, apologizes on  behalf of his client for the inappropriate behavior (that he says were sent by his ex-wife, who was listed as a co-host), and makes a request that I contact Airbnb to  get him reinstated to the platform, following which he will relinquish  any claim he may have against me and resolve all outstanding issues  between us. The message ends with \"this offer will remain open for 21  days, after which time it will no longer be open for acceptance.\"  It's pretty obvious to me at this point that I should contact a lawyer, but  does he really have any ground to stand on here? I know I'm not being officially sued quite yet, but the threat is still there. I documented all of our interactions, including my correspondence with Airbnb that lead to him being removed from the platform, so I have everything in order if needed. I'm not entirely surprised he's  gone this far, but I think I would be very surprised if this somehow went to court **and** I lost. Any thoughts? I've never been sued before, so  advice and feedback is very welcome!\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Quit Claim Title Fraud and now they sold my home out from under my feet. AmIFucked? On the 12th of December, I woke up to find a notice posted on the garage door to my home, which was a notice to Quit & Vacate to any and all occupants. The notice also says that my right to possession of my property has been terminated because the property has been sold on 30 November. This notice was posted by a representative from a local LLC that buys the property. I did not participate in any agreement to sell my property, nor do I intend to sell my home. I then went online to check the status of my property deed on the county assessor parcel map. To my surprise, I found that the property deed was now a \u201cquit claim\u201d deed posted on the 27th of September. This fictitious deed is stating that I am relinquishing 100% of my ownership to Someone Else. This Someone is someone who pretended to be a close friend of mine and gained my trust. I never suspected that he would go to the lengths he went to, or that he would do anything like this to me. When I asked him what this was all about he said it would be in my best interest to just go along with what he was doing and not litigate or go to the police. I fear for my safety and for the safety of my loved ones, should he find out that I am not going along with his plan. I never agreed to any of this, and I don\u2019t want to lose my home. This is the house I grew up in and it was left to me by my parents after they passed away. My parents worked hard to make sure that I would have this house when I came of age, and they would be so disappointed and upset to see this happen to me. There must be a way to reverse the damage done by Someone, there must be some action I can take to prevent the damage from becoming permanent. Or AmIFucked?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Can my wife get in trouble for taking and posting pictures of kid in my son's class after the school said not to? The situation: My son is in kindergarten and at the beginning of the year his teacher and the principal of the school had a meeting with all of the parents of the kids because they said there was one student who had family court issues. They asked that all parents be careful when taking pictures of their kids and to not show, share or post any pictures with her in them and to edit her out if we want to post them online or otherwise keep them.  My wife has taken my pictures of this son since it is his first year of school. Some of the ones she posted on Facebook and Instagram had the girl in question in the background but not in the focus or centre of the picture so she thought it was fine.  The teacher and principal have asked to meet with us and the teacher emailed us that someone from the girl's family who wasn't supposed to have contact with her saw a picture my wife posted. The girl's guardian ended up in the hospital, the girl is no longer coming to school and her family member was arrested.  My question: Can the school do anything to my wife? She didn't do anything illegal but the teacher and principal have talked to the police and given them my wife's name since our son was the focus of the pictures found with the family member. Were they legally allowed to do this? Can we forgo the meeting? It's a public school if that makes a difference.  The location: the state of Florida\n\nAssistant:": {

Express any regrets you might have and apologize.  3. I doubt your wife can be criminally charged. I think she should be, but I don't make the laws.

    "\n\nHuman: [NSW, Australia] Private Investigator has contacted me asking questions about my estranged brother. I'm getting a bad vibe from him, and I think there's more to the story than that. How much do I legally have to say? Do I even need to state truths to him? Short backstory, I distanced myself from my family years ago. I had a really bad living situation with my brother and myself and it ended with my mother attempting to take hold of most of my life. I haven't had more than passing contact with my family in a long while and I very much like it that way.  I had a fellow doorknock earlier in the week, and he's stated straight up that he's investigating my brother and would like information on a few bits of his past. I said very little more than verified indirectly that yes he's my brother and I don't speak to him.  Since then I've been contacted via email (not hard to find) and phone (several times) by the same guy, who is getting pushy and asking questions that lead me to think this isn't an investigation of my brother, but an investigation of me by my mother.  Am I required to say anything to the PI? Is there any way to verify he's even a private investigator? is this some authorised status or can anyone claim to be a private investigator? The fellow has stated that this is his \"official investigation into <brothersname>\".   Is he required to tell me the truth about his investigations? Do I even have to tell him the truth? Can I legally lie to him?  My initial gut feeling is I can lie my arse off to him and he to me and it has no bearing on anything, but I'd like to know where it stands legally.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: [California] Crazy Neighbor Keeps Shutting Off My Electricity Hi all,  Got a weird one for you. I have a crazy neighbor. Like actually crazy - talks about aliens and randomly cusses in his backyard at invisible people. Turns out he also likes to shut off people's electricity.  I live in a townhome where our electrical panels are outside the building and unlocked. A few months back, my power went out and I had no idea why so I called an electrician since none of my breakers were tripped. Turns out the outside panel was switched off.  Weird, we figured it was a neighborhood kid or something.  But the panel happens to be close to one of the windows where I work, so now I'm on the lookout for my building in case it happens again.  Turns out it's a full grown man. I was in disbelief at first and just shouted 'why' out the window and in response he flipped me off and ran away. Keep in mind I recently moved in so nobody should have a beef with me so far, especially not somebody I don't even know.  I called the police and they told me since the panel is an open access panel no crime was committed and it is a civil matter. I was a bit shocked that anybody can turn off our building's power without consequence.  I asked around, and turns out people in my building know him. Local crazy neighbor. So now I have his address and name.  My question is, what can I do if he keeps shutting off our power? Our HOA said they would look into adding a lock for the panel but are concerned about emergency access with a lock so they may not add one.  Off the top of my head I considered suing for damages if he shuts off my power while I'm working from home or something, just to have him face some sort of minor consequence. Just really surprised it's not a criminal act and not sure where to go from here. I can think of a lot of actions to remedy this that aren't legal but I'd love to hear what I can do legally.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: My company has added a coworkers income into my draw because \"most of the work she does benefits me\". My wife and I work for the same company. She is salaried and I work on commission, paid a draw abd then my commissions are to be paid out monthly. I put in my notice two weeks ago because I haven't seen commission since February. With my notice I noted that the state law around termination of employment for a commissioned sales person is that they pay me 100% up to date within 30 days of my last day.   Today I received my commission statement and when they figured my draw against my commission, for the first time in five years, the deducted my wifes salary in full from my commissions. So effectively, I paid her for the last 5 months instead of the company.   My CEO says we discussed this but we definitely never did. What does my recourse look like here if he does not correct this? I'm in Missouri and he is in California if that matters.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: (Illinois) My aunt died and left me her record collection. I found out some of the records are extremely rare and worth alot of money. Now my relatives are foaming at the mouth trying to get their hands on the records and are threatening to take me to court. Hey reddit... Well, like the title says, we lost my aunt in January. It really wasn't totally unexpected but it was still really hard to deal with. My aunt didn't have any kids of her own, so her nieces and nephews were her kids. She was close to all of us and she was really like a second mom. My aunt loved her vinyl collection and we'd listen to her records and talk about her favorite bands together for as long back as I can remember. Before she died she told me she wanted me to take the records and her turntable and made me promise not to sell them which of course I said I wouldn't. I took them with me at her insistence maybe several days before she passed.  Since the funeral I've finally sat down and looked at all the records with my best friend who's a huge vinyl lover. It turns out that some of the records in her collection are worth hundred and or thousands of dollars. It was kind of cool to find that out but again, no big because I promised I wasn't gonna sell.  Well I made the mistake of telling my sister....who then told my mom....and now word has leaked out to the other neices and nephews. My mom is telling me that it isn't fair that my aunt left me something so valuable and that it isn't right for me to keep what she says is a small fortune to myself. The others (my aunt's two neices and nephew that aren't my siblings) are saying that I had no right to take the records and that I need to return them before they get the court involved. They said that we can settle the matter out of court if I agree to take the records to an appraiser, sell them, and split the amount from the sales with them with a portion going to everyone and that it's what my aunt would've wanted because she loved all the kids equally.  I don't think so. She gave these to me and not them and they just want to sell them because they want the money. My question is can they take me to court? I don't want to sell them but I don't know how any of that works.   Help? Anyone?  tldr: my aunt left me very rare and valuable records. My family didn't care until they found out how much they were worth. Now they're pissed at me and trying to pressure me to sell them and are threatening to take me to court.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: I think my boyfriend has been drugging me to make me forget things. He is a doctor. This is in north Texas.   Hey so I must apologize if this post is jumbled a bit. I started typing it up in Word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today.   I think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. I know this is going to be hard to explain, but I have been having gaps in memory that I have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  I was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then I started to notice that this seems to happen when I go on dates with him.   I know it must be crazy, but I have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  I know its him as\u2026 well I wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would\u2026   The first time it happened was when we were drinking and I wrote it off as too much to drink. We get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. But then there were a few times when I KNOW we were not drinking.   I decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. I had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time I talked with him. I remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. My car and his car was in the parking lot too so I was confused.   I decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.  After 3 days at his place I remembered everything so I was started to trust him again. Knowing he was an ENT I know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. I was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said I should be treating those sores.   I had completely forgotten they were there. These little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. I got so freaked out he mentioned them that I decided to leave.   The next day he came over to \u201cCheck on me\u201d and I remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest.   Then today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. I never agreed to me with him and would never want to. He does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something I have no memory of.   I am sick and tired of it and want him punished.   This has started to affect my work life as well as I start to get paranoid when I see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. I get paranoid that they are about to fire me. My friends also state I have been acting strangely and out of character. I have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when I do.    Is there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? I do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so I want to be damn sure when I go to the police.\n\nAssistant:": {

My first bit of advice is for you to get professional treatment of the bed bugs. It is not cheap, but they are incredibly difficult to get rid of. Bed bugs can survive a year or more without feeding and do cause a wide array of psychological issues due to prolonged extremely poor sleep. I sincerely hope this is the cause of your issues, but I would also talk to your doctor (not your boyfriend) about your symptoms. Request bloodwork.",

    "\n\nHuman: Turned down unidentified school resource officer, received a ticket, can I contest this? I'm sorry, this is a really strange situation for me, I'd love some advice on where to go from here   On friday I was picking up my daughter at school, we live on a military base in Colorado.  The school has a small roundabout in the front for afterschool activity buses and special circumstance pickups, my daughter has cerebral palsy so I pick her up and drop her off here every day, which has been okayed by the school since it's a way shorter walk than the regular designated pick up spot and she has so many appointments that we're coming and going multiple times most days.   After I parked in visitor parking to wait for her a man dressed all in black (polo and slacks) came up to my car door and stood almost touching the window, staring in at me smiling, I turned my body away from the window to try to signal that I didnt want to engage and called my daughters phone to see where she was. The man kept staring at me so I locked the doors, he tapped on the glass and said \"I just want to talk\".  I was starting to get nervous so I said through the glass \"Please go away, you're creeping me out!\"   He immediately looked offended, walked behind my car and blocked me in, I texted my husband to ask him to please come, then started to call the school to ask for help when the parking lot monitor came up to talk to him. I see her everyday so I hung up & hopped out of the car and told her this guy was making me nervous, he yelled at me that units were on the way and that I was violating federal installation procedures. I asked the parking monitor what was happening and she said he was the school resource officer and to just go get my daughter.   I went inside and helped my daughter out to the car, the whole time I walked out he was glaring at me. I said \"I'm sorry, I didn't know you were an officer, what's happening?\"  He said I had failed to identify myself on a military installation, was belligerent, and would not be allowed to leave until more units arrived. He made me wait outside of the car and when I asked if I could go to my daughter who was scared and crying in the car he said no I needed to remain in sight. It wasnt super cold that day but still I was in leggings and a tank top and its winter in CO, we waited around 10 minutes.   I asked him to please call the principal or a school authority out to witness since he was scaring me being so visibly angry. He refused at first but after the 4(!) military police officers he called came he did contact the school. The officers talked to him and he told them I refused to tell him my name and had expired paperwork. An MP came and asked why my registration was expired. I said \"no, it's not\" and after he gave me the okay to go in my car I showed him my current registration and IDs, he said \"oh, officer XYZ must be confused\" I told him he'd never asked for my info and that there must have been a mix up since I didn't know he was an officer. He asked if he'd told me he was an officer and when I said no he rolled his eyes.  The principal came out and asked what was going on, then told the officers that I'm allowed to use the roundabout since I have a special needs student. The officers said that they could only go by what the schools officer reported and that he'd reported I was going  the wrong way down a one way (there is only 1 access point for cars).   The school resource officer was standing maybe 10 feet away during the whole exchange just staring at me until my husband showed up, then he moved across the roundabout but continued glaring at me.  The MPs ticketed me per his request but told me\"we don't see you being belligerent, you've been helpful to us the whole time but we can only go off what he says\".   The ticket says it is for \"drove wrong way on one way roadway\" and carries a $100 fine. There's only 1 way in and out for personal vehicles and theres no posted 1 way sign.    Before they left the main officer gave me a card and said *if* I were going to want to file a complaint I should contact these numbers. The principal apologized and said that he'd never seen the SRO acting this way and when we come back from break he would have a special sticker made to identify that I'm allowed to pick up and drop off my disabled student there.   I called the complaint/compliment line from the card after I got home and of course no answer, voicemailbox was full then disconnected. The sergeants number on the card just rang with no answer. I googled the main line and was transferred to him and when I told him how weird the whole thing was he just kind of laughed at me and said he'd talk to him later.  It's a little thing but it shook me up, I'm nervous about possibly  having to see him for the rest of the school year, I'm wondering if it's okay to contest the ticket and what I would say.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " I'm assuming you are dealing with the on base court system since you were on base. One thing that can help is your husband complaining. He can file a complaint but he can also ask his command to help him file one. It depends on what rank he is and what rank the person who helps him is but usually having the person actually in the military complain gets you farther in the military system. Is the resourse officer active duty or a civilian contractor? The places to complain to change based on who is in charge of him. Make sure to file an ICE complaint for you and have your husband file one as well. The more complaints you file the more likely they will listen.

    "\n\nHuman: Cut my self at work, I needed stitches. Company told me to make a workman\u2019s comp claim. The next day my boss said he would pay half of the bill. So now I owe 300$ if I would have just used my insurance I would have only had to pay 25$ I\u2019m in Iowa, the headline pretty much sums it up. I\u2019m in construction, I cut myself with my razor knife by accident. I called my HR, she told me to go to the urgent care of my choosing. I was told to tell the doctor it happened at work. I had to go into the office the next morning to fill out a accident report. Then the bill came in the mail to my house. I was told bring the bill into the office. Then my boss called the doctors office and paid half the bill over the phone. Now I have to pay the other 300$. If I would have just left work and not told anybody anything and gone to the doc it would have only been a 25$ co pay. Is this the way workmans comp is supposed to work, I\u2019ve never done this before?\n\nAssistant:": {
