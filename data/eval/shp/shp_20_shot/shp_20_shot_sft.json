So at the moment I am a PhD student in physics, 1st year in the US (MA) and will definitely stay on this track. But, I also really enjoy mathematics, and it helps me every single time I know an entire structure of math, not just one particular theorem from some field I have never heard of, but can be applied to physics.  So I love math enough that I would be willing to do a Masters work in it while doing research for my PhD in physics (by the way, I am in theory). But the catch is how to get around, or convince the graduate school to let me do this.  Every course I take in the math department would help me in my research in physics and knowledge. I would have taken enough courses to earn myself a Masters in mathematics, and I kind of what that piece of paper since I might want to teach not just physics but math also in the future.   My guess for letting the graduate school let me do this (since the math department has no issue) is that I would **not** accept my Masters in physics, and go straight to the PhD, therefore \"substituting\" one Masters for another. I was wondering if there is anything else (like arguments) I could use to reinforce this, or just in general if this even makes sense to do. (I should not, even if I can't get the Masters in math, I will still be taking courses, they are too important).   Thanks.\n\nAssistant:"

My relationship with my supervisor was always a little tense. He never gave useful input but I actually loved that because then I was able to do my own work and write papers I would be interested in. Due to coronavirus shutdown, I accelerated progress and was able to write 3 papers in 2020 and basically am on my way out.   One of our submissions was just returned with request for major revisions due in 15 days. I asked immediately for a meeting, which he ignored and even told me to not use lab resources to make room for other people. Luckily his input is worthless anyway and I am almost done with the revisions.   The problem is he wants me to work for him as much as possible in the lab as well as for his company. I said I don't want to pursue this field and will do something else and while I think he got the message, he now seems to think if he can't benefit off me (he once told me verbatim \"he will milk me as much as he can\" LOL), he has no problem extending my stay.   I will quit if I don't graduate by this summer (I wrote a first draft for my thesis and surprise, he hasn't read it). It may sound stupid and dramatic, but I need money (my family needs support + I just bought an expensive computer thinking I would be out in a few months). I don't want to give an ultimatum because at worst he'll have someone else carry on the last mile and publish those papers + even if not, he is a tenured professor who is in his 60s, doesn't give a shit.   What do I do?   \\--------------  Some other gems:  \\- When my first paper was submitted, he told me it needs more work and probably will be rejected. When it got into a really good journal, he was shocked and visibly upset (cause we need only 3 papers)  \\- We discussed me leaving before and even though I had 2 conference + 1 journal + 2 in review, he said what's the rush? He was so happy to pay me $25k/year when an engineer at that level asks for $200k+/year for a starting salary. Mentioned it a bunch of times.  \\- His instincts are terrible. Every time I get a note \"add this\" or \"remove that\", we get feedback saying this is unrelated or why didn't you describe this in detail. I don't think he is sabotaging me here, it's more like he takes about 15 minutes to review the work and just wants to say things.  \\- Since I completed my thesis and every single requirement, I asked him if I could work full time (or even part time). He said no way, people never finish their thesis if they work because they underestimate the work required to complete (exam, revising thesis etc). Now I'm sitting here and before this rejection/rebuttal had nothing to do. But he found me work: I help some of the newcomers, comment my code and prepare documents for future use. I don't object to these, even though in my last 4 years this type of work never amounted to anything.\n\nAssistant:"

For the sake of academic survival, many researchers try to forge a very positive and optimistic interpretation of what the have or plan to achieve. No one will fund you if you fairly disclose that your methods and data are questionable... but this doesn't excuse overselling \"bad\" science.   It's also important to consider whether the 2nd person in that mtg will side with the PI and claim that you grossly misunderstood the conversation. So I strongly suggest that you follow up with an email or documented conversation that can be read by a 3rd party and objectively conclude that they were asking you to do something clearly unethical.    And beware: Universities from any country will always act on blatant law breaking...but when it comes to the grey zone of ethics, they will most often give the PI the benefit of the doubt. As leaders in their own field and research niche, administrators often consider the \"expert\" in deciding what is okay and what is not to be the PI. Unless there is documented evidence, paper trails, or direct proof, I would expect the university to chalk your situation up to a simple miscommunication.   I encourage you to do the right thing, but also to tread carefully. Consider another serious conversation with the PI and ask for clarification. Make your concerns clear and then decide what to do based on their response. A premature jump to reporting them can do more harm to you than to them, and it could get you \"blacklisted\" in terms of your professional career if this person is truly unethical but able to escape justice.

Most had to start over or received limited credit (1-2 years) toward tenure at their second institution.   Here's the rub: I've served on far too many faculty searches over the years and have seen how search committees respond to denials of tenure. No matter what the file might say, they tend to think \"There's something wrong with this person, is s/he worth the risk to us?\" because obviously another institution rejected them. When you have a flooded market and dozens, if not hundreds, of qualified candidates applying for every job people are looking for any excuse to weed the pool. The fact that someone was effectively fired from a previous job is a pretty good excuse in some people's minds.  There are two exceptions: everyone knows that Harvard/Yale et. al don't typically tenure junior faculty so they get a pass, as do most people who come with $$$ external grants. But there is a very strong bias against anyone perceived to be \"damaged goods\" in the US market, and nobody will trust letters of recommendation from a former department because they believe (with some reason) that those often omit serious problems because the writers/school don't want a lawsuit. So unless there's an inside connection-- someone in the hiring department knows someone in the former department --the odds are the committee is going to balk.  For the majority of US academics, I'd say, a failed tenure bid is a career-ending event. Certainly the vast majority of people I know who have been denied tenure never earned tenure at a second institution."

Our study shows that the validity of citation-based measures is being compromised and their usefulness is lessening. In particular, the number of publications has ceased to be a good metric as a result of longer author lists, shorter papers, and surging publication numbers. Citation-based metrics, such citation number and h-index, are likewise affected by the flood of papers, self-citations, and lengthy reference lists. Measures such as a journal\u2019s impact factor have also ceased to be good metrics due to the soaring numbers of papers that are published in top journals, particularly from the same pool of authors. Moreover, by analyzing properties of >2,600 research fields, we observed that citation-based metrics are not beneficial for comparing researchers in different fields, or even in the same department.  **Conclusions**  > Academic publishing has changed considerably; now we need to reconsider how we measure success.\n\nAssistant:"

In essence, to provide evidence to the thesis one would have to show that the two quantities are no longer statistically correlated.  *Nothing in this paper remotely demonstrates that. Nothing in it even tries to.*  Of course if one WERE to try and do such a thing one would have a bit of a tautological difficulty as how does one assess \"real\" research success without employing a metric? I suppose one would maybe poll people in a field and ask them who they feel are the top researchers and then see if those people also have the top h-indices or the like (I suspect they largely would, invalidating the thesis).  Instead this paper basically just shows that more people are publishing shorter papers , with more co-authors and self-cite more. Again, this does nothing to validate their alleged point."

The reason I'm posing this question is that it seems like a quiet storm that nobody wants to openly discuss and address, which is very upsetting considering that people I love are dead, or have almost died.

I am a second-year postdoc assigned to work on a continuing project. A Ph.D. student and another postdoc have been working on this project. I was given a new but connected part to work on by our PI.   The issue I am having is with this other postdoc on this project. Specifically, this other postdoc sees himself at a higher rank than me (i.e., the project manager), despite us being both postdocs. This could be because this is a continuation of his Ph.D. work (6 years Ph.D. + 1-year postdoc) or because he has been at the same lab for seven years. I find this \u201cmanager behavior\u201d problematic (specifics below). Before I continue, note that I am very receptive to **technical** feedback on my work, which is NOT the issue here.  Examples of this problematic \u201cmanager\u201d behavior are:  * Tries to set my weekly deadlines and tasks for me.     * Example: I was considering learning a simulation tool. He asked me to contact other people who used the tool and ask them, \u201cHow long did it take them to learn it?\u201d The purpose of this question is to set a deadline for me. * Always asking: How long is this going to take you? He sends emails and checks up on me constantly, always starting with \u201chave you had the chance to finish \\[insert task\\].\u201d  * Pushing for a plan: He wants me to write all my tasks for this project and how long each task will take.    * I suspect he will present this plan to our industrial collaborators himself as: \u201cHere is what my team will do.\u201d    * I do not like these plans as each task in my research takes varying lengths of time depending on complexity, which I cannot estimate. I do not see the point. I feel like this plan will be used later as \"Gotcha! You are late doing this!\".   * At some point, he changed pronouns from \u201cI\u201d to \u201cwe\u201d in my slides to be presented to our industrial collaborators, where I talked about my progress. He did not contribute to that work and made it seem like that work was a group effort. * Very pushy in deciding how things on MY part should be done. * Creates a sense of panic and rush (This project is on a short deadline, but still, the behavior is too much).  * Generally, being a micromanager.   Again, we are both at the identical rank.   I want to be left alone and not deal with this behavior. He is not my manager, and I handle my tasks in a certain way, and this behavior affects my productivity. Having weekly meetings where I present my work and receive feedback is fine with me and is appreciated, but none of this other BS he is doing.  I have been trying to push back by arguing my points and explaining that I disagree with his approach, but he is relentless and getting on my nerves.  Final note: Our PI is absent and likely does not want to be involved. The PI never indicated that I should report to this other postdoc. So this behavior is unwarranted from what I can tell.   **Question**: How do I deal with this? I have been trying to remain calm, but it is getting challenging, affecting my productivity as I am constantly angry and frustrated with his behavior. I am afraid I will have to confront him and put him in his place, but I would like to leave that as a last resort and try to resolve this amicably.\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " Okay, the way you describe things does make him sound overbearing, but there are certain aspects of this that don't *necessarily* seem that out of line to me. For context, I'm coming at this from the perspective of someone working in particle physics, an inherently collaborative field, and so people having interconnected work (and as such requiring cooperation on timelines and outputs) is a given. And we're not that hung up on rank; if a PhD student is leading work and they need something from a postdoc, for example, the postdoc isn't going to get het up by the student trying to get updates/a timeline on that work.  With regards to this:  > Specifically, this other postdoc sees himself at a higher rank than me (i.e., the project manager), despite us being both postdocs. This could be because this is a continuation of his Ph.D. work (6 years Ph.D. + 1-year postdoc) or because he has been at the same lab for seven years.  I think you're getting way too caught up on \"rank\" here. Yes, you might both have the same job title and pay grade, but think instead of your positions *functionally* with regards to the project. He might not be the project manager, but I think we need to acknowledge that he has been working on this project a lot longer than you, and if you (as you say) have a largely absent PI, then that is the role he will have naturally performed. You have been given a connected piece of work to this project he has been working on for a much longer time, and if his work is in any way dependent on your work, then it is perfectly reasonable that he would want to know how long your work will take.  Now my clear caveat to that point is if absolutely nothing you do impacts his work then he has no grounds to do that, but from what you've written it sounds like your tasks are interconnected and your working group is on a pretty short deadline.  If that caveat does not apply though, I think it is perfectly reasonable for him to want an idea of your timelines. It is entirely possible that he is going about asking for this information in an unreasonable way. Similarly, on pushing for the \"how\" things should be done, giving you advice about something he has more experience in would be reasonable, but it sounds like he is doing that in an unreasonable way.  A point about you:  > * Pushing for a plan: He wants me to write all my tasks for this project and how long each task will take.  > * I suspect he will present this plan to our industrial collaborators himself as: \u201cHere is what my team will do.\u201d  > * I do not like these plans as each task in my research takes varying lengths of time depending on complexity, which I cannot estimate. I do not see the point. I feel like this plan will be used later as \"Gotcha! You are late doing this!\".  So the \"here is what my team will do\" is entirely supposition on your part, and isn't a fair reason not to give a plan. And it is entirely reasonable to want to have a plan for a project that is working to a short deadline. Your argument not to give any estimates is not a good one. Yes, things can take varying amounts of time, but you should at least be able to give a rough estimate. It speaks to a lack of experience/care that you cannot. You can't possibly plan a project with zero idea of how long things will take. This is why project managers love their gantt charts, because without a plan things can easily fall apart.  > I want to be left alone and not deal with this behavior.   But you work in a team that is doing a shared project. That will never be possible.  > I have been trying to push back by arguing my points and explaining that I disagree with his approach, but he is relentless and getting on my nerves.  The issue with that is you're assuming his approach is the (only) wrong one. Having read your post I think you're both in the wrong. He is clearly being pushy in his approach to querying your work, but you're so hung up on \"rank\" that you're ignoring the very good reasons he might have for doing so, and you seem unwilling to commit to timelines on a project where there are short deadlines. And if you consistently do so, I could see why he'd just push harder to try and get a timeline.  -------------------------------------------------------------------  On to practical advice:  Arrange a meeting with him, say that you want to discuss the project milestones and timelines. Get both of you on the same page about what needs to be done and when. Figure out which parts of the work are dependent on others, and negotiate fair lead times to get these things done. Turn this into a partnership, so that you both have ownership of how the project is managed. You can absolutely make the point that you don't feel comfortable being told how to do something without having asked. And that you don't want to feel like he is trying to micromanage your time.   But at the same time, you need to recognise that in a shared project, the time you take to do things does impact other people, and you can't take a laissez faire attitude to providing estimates. You need to be able to say how long things will take so that people have reasonable expectations and they can plan around your work. Even when things take \"varying lengths of time depending on complexity\", you should be able to judge the complexity appropriately to be able to give some kind of estimate."

As well as the point that since the Neanderthals didn't leave any writing behind we can't ever know for sure what was going on in their heads. So even academics are still just making educated guesses. As long as posters admit they are not speaking authoritatively, for posts like this it is hard to require \"accurate\" answers because there aren't any.   But for a more academic approach, you can read this article, which discusses whether they were intentional and the different arguments about it.. Essentially, the primary hypotheses are:   1. Burying dead for practical reasons: prevent scavengers from coming around, bad smells, disease, etc. 2. Accidental burials: Bodies just happened to end up in holes because they died there, scavengers drop them there, or it was a trash pit and bodies were among other trash thrown in there (this last point arguing against items found with bodies being offerings.) 3. Burying the dead because of sentiment: there may have been no concept of an afterlife but they still didn't want to watch a loved one rot and/or be consumed by scavengers & bugs.  4. Burying for religious reasons: there was a concept that some part of the person continued after death, which is why some sites may indicate the presence of grave goods. Heavy emphasis on later more well understood burial practices of *Homo sapien sapiens* being a continuation of this line of thinking/belief.   You may have seen the recent interest in a study about Neanderthal burials. The primary reason it was exciting was that the authors claimed it definitively proved the burials at their site were purposeful. The bones had no evidence of being gnawed on by scavengers and they argued that the holes were not naturally made."

How to explain Mesolithic graves where someone stood and knapped an entire blade core into the grave, blades are functional no? Why would they need them in the grave? Take Skateholm in Sweden, why would a buried dog need an antler hammer? Look at the Langdale greenstone axes, axes are functional or are they attractive, or is there some quality we don't understand that straddles both? We are missing the context in which material culture arises in almost all of prehistory, why would someone go to the trouble of carving out an ornate beetle from lignite and carry it around alongside an actual necklace trilobite fossil? Unless perhaps there were taboos that had been violated and needed restoring thus allowing animals to be fished and hunted. We just don't know.

In all likelihood, bottle gourds probably had many uses. Immature gourds are technically edible.  Additionally, dried gourds could be rattles used in entertainment and ritual purposes for example. In many parts of West Africa, the gourds were historically decorated and used in divination rituals or containers for ritual substances and its no stretch to suppose they had similar functions in other places and times. As you point out, more practical uses would be bottles for liquids (water, beer, milk, etc\u2026) or as containers and tools like bowls or ladles.  For early hunter gatherers though, the most vital and attractive feature probably was for storing water.  Consider how wide-spread and populous humanity became after the end of the Pleistocene coinciding with the hypothetical domestication of the bottle gourd.  That kind of distribution and adaptation could only have been possible in many parts of the world if humans had a way to store and transport potable water in areas where such water was scarce.

Adams and Mt. Hood (They both have different names in the various local languages, so I'm keeping it simple and using their contemporary Anglo names).  Mssrs Lewis and Clark didn't necessarily know what to make of such tales, but come to find out, some 200 years later, geologists and hydrologists have definitively affirmed that such a thing did in fact occur; that there was once a giant sort of natural bridge across the Columbia Gorge, that there was a massive Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake roughly 150 years prior to the L and C Expedition, and that said massive earthquake definitely caused the collapse of said giant natural bridge, which is kind of a shame, since it must have been one of the great natural wonders of the world when it existed."

There are a number of reasons that skin colour and altitude are correlated, but there are two mains ones. #1 Melanin protects the skin from heavy sun exposure and prevents the destruction of some vital light sensitive nutrients (e.g. Folate). #2 Melanin blocks sunlight which is necessary for vitamin D synthesis - in areas with low sunlight having darker skin increases the risk of vitamin D deficiency and rickets.  I can't comment on your the specific populations you used as examples. However, in general, skin colour does not exactly correlate to latitude for a number of reasons.  1) Similar latitudes do not necessarily have similar UV exposure. There might, for example, be differences in cloud cover. Or less protection from the ozone layer. I'm no expert on this, but UV lines are a little wobbly!  **2)** Population migration - quite simply, those populations who have migrated more recently are less likely to match up to the expected level of skin reflectance and skin colouration. After 10-20,000 people seem to conform to expected skin reflectivity values - but humans are a lot more antsy than that! Migration seems to account for most outliers.  3) Skin colour is plastic and changes with sun exposure - one population where most people have jobs indoors will likely have a lighter average skin colour than a similar population who often work outside... or take long holidays in the bahamas. Tanning!!  4) There is more to skin colour than just melenin. All sorts of things can affect skin colour - to pick just one example, the number of capillaries on the skins surface can have a marked effect. I know less about this, but two skins of somewhat different hues may have similar melenin levels and, thus, be equality efficient at protecting against UV.  For more on this #1 & 2 Jablonski's 2000 article \"The Evolution of Skin Colouration\" has you covered. Or is that \"coloration\"? Help me out here."

One culture might see reliable river transportation as a problem to be solved, and another may not. One culture might derive value from the commodification of resources and another might derive value in largesse and sharing: both of those cultures will solve the knock-on problems of those value judgements very differently. So if one culture develops industrial capitalism as a result and another develops potlatching, they can't be judged in the same way, because ultimately they're expressions of a totally different set of problems to be solved.   Like another poster mentioned, a lot of seemingly simple solutions to common problems are technology. Birchbark or dugout canoes are technology. Trap building is technology. Enthnogeography is technology. Social hierarchies built around trade and hunting are technology.   If we look at technology only as the stuff that created ocean sailing vessels or spaceships, then we're falling into the trap created by enlightenment and imperialist thinkers that were asking the question \"why did white people win history\" instead of \"how did cultures perceive their needs and solve their problems related to those needs.\""

Some all powerful father figure who loves them unconditionally. Thats not how polytheistic religions, or even early monotheistic religions viewed their gods, like at all.   Most ancient gods honestly didn't give a shit about humans. Look at ancient mythology and humans are depicted more as a mistake or a curiosity to the gods than as children to be loved and groomed and cared for. The gods weren't nice, they weren't kind they were fearful awesome things that had their own lives and issues (seriously look to the greek gods or babylonian mythos to see how true that one is).   The only reason ancient gods gave any shit about humans was to play games with them (even the bible has the story of Job which can basically be summed up as the story of God and his drinking buddy the Devil take a bet that the Devil can fuck with this dude's life enough to get him to stop loving God, and God's response is \"go ahead I have that dude so whipped nothing you could do will change him\"). So a sacrifice in their honor was a way to appease these wrathful and often vain and greedy deities. In a religion with sacrifice you didn't sacrifice the whole animal, you would sacrifice the best and most desirable parts of the animal, and then either the priests, the community or your family got to keep the rest. It was a way of inviting the god into, and then bribing the god to take interest and take part in your community (since you know you don't normally want to harm people giving you free good food).  Gods weren't things to be loved, they were things to be feared and respected.  And you can partially look at that in relation to the environments and conditions these religions evolved in. The Babylonians are a really good example of this when compared to the Egyptians. Though both pantheons are rather dysfunctional in ways they are markedly different in that the Babylonian gods are basically the cause of all the problems in the stories while the egyptian gods are far more pacific by any stretch and mostly keep to themselves. In many ways this is similar to the environments the cultures are in. The Nile is an incredibly predictable river in how an when it floods, and the environment is fairly stable. The Tigris and Euphrates where the Babylonians on the other hand flooded unpredictably in both how high they flood and when. So for the people who lived around these rivers the gods who can be seen as representations of natural forces. So for the Egyptians their religion was strict and needed, but fair and predictable; for the Babylonians the gods were pretty much just unpredictable forces that must be appeased.  That sort of HBE approch to religion can also describe how religion today has shaped and changed, today's world is far more predictable and good to live in for it's populace, so gods tend to be seen more loving and caring rather than awesome and awful."

It seems like you're in the US, which means it can feel awfully weird that the two aren't one field. We're used to things being easily divided based on what you study, and both anthropology and sociology study, well, people. The separation is mostly a quirk of history. American anthropology began as ethnological studies of Native American tribes; biological anthropology and archaeology developed to supplement this with different datasets. US anthro departments grew via the work of the American Bureau of Ethnology, of the Smithsonian/AMNH/Field Museums, and of Morgan, Tyler, and Boas. European anthropology was shaped by the likes of Tylor and Malinowski out of the primordial social science soup of Marx/Durkheim/Weber/etc. Thus you get the fields of social anthropology, cultural anthropology, and sociology developing in tandem based on which scholarly precedent you followed. The difference between social and cultural anthropology just doesn't exist in the US, because the departments here began rather untethered from the general thread of \"Social Science.\"  At the end of the day, these are just labels that people put on departments, journals, and professional associations; people who police what counts as counts as one field or another are being pedantic."

Their allergies are as follows- cow dairy, corn, cane sugar, agave, dates, peanuts, soy. Really not much of an issue as far as savory courses go, but I'm having a hard time coming up with a dessert dish for them that isn't just a pudding or a sorbet, the no dates or cow dairy make it kind of hard, and I'd really like to make a cake with frosting if possible.

It's a very particular recipe as the technique and leavening agent used should result in a honeycomb striation. Otherwise, it could result in a dense fallen cake.

I understand that single-acting baking powder activates on contact with liquid, while double-acting baking powder activates once when added and again when heated.

If the goal is to get the cake to rise and create bubbly striations, wouldn't the double-acting baking powder be more effective?

I thought maybe there was something wrong with one of the ingredients, so today I replaced most of the ingredients and tried again. Same smell, except maybe slightly less so.

I don't know what could have changed, and I've replaced most of the ingredients already with fresh(er) ones. Could it be because I added salt in with the eggs before mixing and it's messing with them somehow? Could it be the remains from something previously cooked in the oven being absorbed into the cookies somehow? Could I have been unlucky and got bad eggs twice in a row in 2 different cartons?

Round Cake pan- start small with an 6inch round cake pan 3. Square pan- get a big one, rectangle or square. 8inch atleast. Good for cinnamon rolls, brownies, bars, sponges, dinner rolls. Very versatile.  4. Flat sheet trays- cookies, macarons, etc. handy to have extra on hand for big batches of bakes  5. Oven thermometer- just for better oven temp reading. 6. Silicon spatula- get small, medium, and large. Great for cooking stuff like compote, caramel, creme anglaise, pastry cream. The way silicon spatula bends allows better scrapping to prevent burns on the bottom of pan. Not all spatula are made equal, good ones usually has burgandy red handle and white scraper tip. 7. Rolling pins- i prefer just the slab of wood, ive never liked metals with mechanical handles that rotates on its own as they break easily. 8. Hand mixer- if you cant afford a stand mixer, atleast get a hand mixer. Good for heavy duty mixing like meringue, buttercream, frosting, foams. 9. Palette knife aka metal spatula- good for spreading batters, leveling frosting, decorating, etc.  10. Whisk- get a medium and large ones, get ones with thick flexible wires and very wide balloon shapes as that whips and mixes better.  11. Basic piping tips- small round (2mm) for lettering, a medium round, large round, medium star, and large star. Those are the essentials for beginner decorating.  12. Fine mesh strainer or Tamis- for sifting and straining."

I took my 2022 Subaru BRZ to a well-reviewed family owned muffler shop 10 days ago and had them install an exhaust for me. Last Friday while washing my car I found this damage on my car, paint completely stripped off under my passenger door, and a lazy attempt to hide it. I keep my car in a secured garage and hadn\u2019t taken it to a different shop aside from them. My mechanic friends confirmed it and said the damage was right where an  arm from a 2-post lift would swing under if the tech was careless and didn\u2019t realize my car sits lower than your typical SUV, so he swung it under without checking and damaged it.  On Friday I called the muffler shop owner politely asking them if it was them, and he denied and said his tech didn\u2019t do it and that they were \u201cgood guys\u201d. I was furious because clearly they wouldn\u2019t admit if if they tried to cover it up with white tape.

Mechanic says he can't find anything wrong. 2012 Honda Civic - what in the world happened that no one is thinking of? Hi car guys!     So, I just got off of the phone with my mechanic and am sitting here in a very confused state. The first thing that popped into my head was to google \"car help\" and \"Reddit\" - I need you guys. Here's what's going on with me: I drive a 2012 Honda Civic. I don't know if I need to specify it's a hybrid - I know nothing about cars and if that's an assumed thing with this vehicle. Last Friday, I was doing 80 down the highway in the left lane, heard something hit the bottom of my car, looked in the rearview just out of reaction and saw a little black thing bouncing to the next car behind me. Nothing major.  So, not even 3 minutes later, you guys, my vision on the sides goes black, my heart is RACING and I feel like I have to puke. I pull over to the shoulder, flung the door open and got out with the dog. I was bent over the median, breathing and trying to regain my composure when luckily a state cop came up behind me and helped me out. I told him, \"I was driving perfectly fine, I THINK I heard or felt something scrape or hit the bottom of the car - but nothing bigger than a normal like, rock or take out cup, and then I smelt a weird smell in my car through the AC, lost my peripheral vision, heart started going wild and I had to throw up.\" He's looking at me like I'm insane. He says that he sees no leak, to get back in my car and keep going - that I am fine.   I get back in, I start the car up, I pull back into the flow of traffic and within a minute, I feel sick again and think I smell a weird smell. I'm not talking eggs, it was not sulfuric at all. There WAS a mix of a gas smell, but the only way I can accurately and best describe it is just: \"chemically\". So I feel sick, get off the closest exit, pull into the truck stop, turn it off and get out and walk away from it again with my dog. For 3 hours, I sat and waited for a tow. I ended up having it towed to the mechanic's because every time I tried turning it on and getting it going, I would feel sick and have to throw up. It was so BIZARRE. My dad calls, says \"roll down all of your windows, turn off all AC/heat/everything and pull your mask up over your face, tell me what happens.\" I do this, I'm fine for like 5 minutes, then it hits again and I get sick and I turn it off. That's when I did decide to have it towed, cause he said that was too weird to chance me driving it back myself.   I had it dropped off at the mechanic's and it's been there a week now. I just got off of the phone with him, finally, and he's like, \"....I cannot find anything wrong with it. I checked your fluids, I've been looking, but nothing. Your Hybrid light just came on, that's new, so I don't know if it's that but I'm going to keep looking and I'll call you back tonight again,\" and now here I am. I trust our guy with everything - I've gone to him for like 8 years now - he isn't full of shit. I am sitting here questioning my sanity now though. What in the WORLD happened, is happening and is going to happen if I drive it again!? I am now like, \"Did your body freak out and you had a weird attack and it had nothing to do with the car?\" I'll tell you, that's never happened to me before but I guess there's a first for everything.  Again, 2012 Honda Civic, Hybrid. Bought from a dealership in 2017. We have 100k miles on it right now. Have had zero issues with it and we keep up with it like it's our baby.

Yeah, firstly, I'm a huge dumbass, get your laughs in lol. I'm no car guy. Lesson learned. Don't buy used without making sure it has passed a smog check in the Golden State.  It's a 2002 Camry LE which looks awful, but runs great. Problem is, both of the car's catalytic converters need to be replaced, and to do so would cost way more than a sane person ought to spend on this car (more than I spent on buying it, and way more than I have laying around my account).  Since you're legally not supposed to sell a car without also including a smog check pass, I tried to contact the seller, but of course he ran off. That's another long story, I'm certain I just got duped. I don't know what part of his story or information is legit, and at this point it seems like it will be too much money to track him down and open a case against him in court.  So, basically, I have this unregistered car in my driveway. I have the old title and old registration in the seller's name (my name is on the title on the transfer side), but no documentation under my name.  My goal is to get rid of this car and hopefully get some portion of my money back. Cash for Clunkers can't take it without its cat converts and no title/reg. Kars 4 Kids could take it, but the tax rebate would go to the seller (because the title is in his name). It seems like selling to a junkyard also requires some registration and such.  Does anyone know what a dumbass like me can do to maybe, hopefully, get rid of this car and get any amount of money back on this landmine of a craigslist purchase? Hell, what can I do even if I give up on getting any money back? Happy to answer any questions, maybe through DM if sensitive. Thanks all.\n\nAssistant:"

I'd love to serve this for lunch, but I'd also love to not have to wake up before 4am on Christmas Day.  Would it be possible to do the 8-hour roast on the 24th, let the pork cool to room temperature and stick it in the fridge overnight, and then do the high-temp 20-minute roast shortly before my guests sit down to lunch on the 25th?  This other Serious Eats recipe for a roasted prime rib is pretty similar and indicates that if the first roast is finished way before guests arrive, the meat can be brought back up to temp by cooking for 45 minutes in a 200F oven before the final high-temp roast. Is there any reason that wouldn't work for a pork shoulder?  Thanks!  Also, if anyone has an recommendations for good sides with a roasted pork shoulder, I'm all ears.\n\nAssistant:"

Grill: Looks pretty, you get that char-broiled flavor, depending on fuel for the fire (wood/coal/etc.) you get those flavors as well, and grill marks (which are aesthetically pleasing but do not offer much in terms of flavor change).  You're also left with less fat in the patty, losing the taste of the rendered fat which yields a lot of that beefy flavor.  The differences aren't too significant.  If you love a burger, then you love a burger, though you may have a preference, both are still enjoyable.  Personal preference though is griddled on a flat top or in a searing hot cast iron.

The problem with sweet potatoes is that they're high in sugar and they'll burn far easier than they'll crisp up.  The solution is to remove as much starch as possible by cutting, rinsing, blanching, chilling and cooking them again to get them crispy.  The second part is to inhibit the starches from caramelizing in the first place by acidifying the wedges slightly.  Caramelization and the maillard reaction is delayed the lower the pH goes.  A healthy squeeze of lemon juice in the blanching water is a good start since citric acid is a very effective acid.  Even better would be granulated citric acid in the lukewarm soaking water.  Not too much though.  Maybe 1tbsp per gallon of water."

It is difficult to give advice on these things without a relationship with the patient. Especially because you have minimal support from medical professionals if the advice leads to complications.   That being said, I will write out my general counseling when I have helped a woman with a medication abortion in the past.   In the US, we only use mifepristone and misoprostol for medication abortion. Methergine is a medicine used to make the uterus contract and decrease bleeding. It is contraindicated in hypertension. Without going into details with a physician and monitoring, I would not use methergine.   How I counsel patients: 1. Medication administration: take the mifepristone, and 24-48 hours later take the misoprostol (800mcg). You should start to have cramping and bleeding within 12 hours of taking this.  2. What to expect: Nausea and cramping (usually more than period cramps) and bleeding like a heavy period. You may or may not pass clots and tissue. By the end of 24 hours from the start of bleeding, it should be tapering off to a lighter flow similar to a period.  I usually send medication for nausea to help.  For the cramping: Ibuprofen 800mg every 8 hours, staggered with Acetaminophen 1000mg every 6 hours. Some providers will give even stronger medication such as narcotics.  Please note, ibuprofen should be avoided in patients with kidney disease.  Please don\u2019t use anything in the vagina for bleeding.  3. When to go to the emergency room: Fever, feeling very unwell/severe dizziness. Especially with a history of anemia, she is at risk of heavy bleeding that could cause problems. Severe pain could be a sign of a complication as well. Lastly, heavy bleeding where you fill a pad an hour for more than two hours in a row should prompt going to the ED immediately.  4. Risks of the procedure: Heavy bleeding or life-threatening bleeding, failure of the medication (about 5-10% if less than 8 weeks along) and infection. These risks are substantially higher at more than 10 weeks gestation.   One last thought, in the unlikely event that she needs to go to the emergency room it is very difficult to tell the difference of a complicated medication abortion and natural miscarriage. A physician cannot tell the difference unless you disclose that information. I never recommend hiding information from your doctor, but I would also not want you to be discouraged from going to the emergency room in the interest of secrecy.    Hopefully, this if helpful to you!  EDIT:  5. Follow up: please follow up with a medical professional to ensure everything has passed safely and get effective contraception.  If the medication is unsuccessful you can have infections and other complications. Prevention of unintended pregnancy is the most important aspect of abortion care.  She should also know her blood type, because some guidelines recommend receiving a medication called Rhogam at the time of bleeding. This is to prevent antibodies from the embryo if you are Rh negative. Antibodies in your blood make future pregnancies and blood transfusions complicated and riskier."

I was alerted to it because I heard his his head hit the tile floor in our kitchen. This isn\u2019t the first time he has been injured in one of these falls.  In addition to that his appetite has become increasingly poor. The only foods he can tolerate are rice milk, rice cereal and peanut butter toast. He has also lost a fair amount of weight (20 lbs in the last 6 months).  He has had a Colonoscopy/Endoscopy within the last several months that was clear. He was also tested for food sensitivities/allergies. He also has had blood work done and everything was good.  His health history has been good with the exception of a parasite he contracted approximately 6 years ago while traveling out of the country. This parasite put him in the ICU and almost killed him. Thankfully the ICU doctors were able to treat the parasite but he was left with holes in his intestines. He is unsure of type of parasite but is confident that he contracted it from water in Uzbekistan. After the parasite he was never able to fully gain all of the healthy weight he had pre-parasite.  All of the doctors he has seen are stumped. Right now it\u2019s a wait and see but with the increasing fainting spells, losing weight and poor appetite we don\u2019t know what to do. At this point I\u2019m afraid to let him out of my sight for too long for fear that he\u2019ll really hurt himself during one of these falls.   Is there any advice on what this could be or what we should have him tested for?\n\nAssistant:"

Please delete if not appropriate.\u00a0  My dad died suddenly at age 65 on 9/24 and the ER doc that pronounced him speculated that the cause was a pulmonary\u00a0embolism. He said that when they put a tube down his throat to open an airway there was blood present which is a sign of a PE. I guess part of my coming to terms with his death involves understanding his last seconds/minutes and what it was like from his perspective. I'm hoping a doctor\u00a0can offer some insight into what it is like to die from a pulmonary embolism.   We were texting back and forth at 7:21 am and he was totally fine; he left the house to go on his morning walk, and my mom found him dead in the middle of the road about an hour later. Looking through his Apple Watch data, his exercise\u00a0app showed 106 bpm and then suddenly went flat at 7:35 am. He was found face down with his arms by his side and a large contusion on his forehead. There was no evidence he even tried to break his fall, so clearly it happened quickly. Things I'm curious about:  Does the clot travel to the lungs and then cause suffocation? Would he have been experiencing lack of air in the moments leading up to his collapse and then just drop from that? What is it that actually happens physiologically from a PE to make someone go from walking to just face planting\u00a0dead? Is it likely he felt \"off\" or had some sort of warning or does it come out of nowhere?  Any insight is very much appreciated.\n\nAssistant:"

Physiologically, the clot gets stuck in the lung, the right side of your heart (which pushes blood through the lungs) can't keep up with the increased strain and pressure because of the clot. Imagine the extra force it takes to push something through a really small hole vs a big hole. If the right heart can't push blood, it doesn't make it to the left side of your heart which pumps blood to the rest of your body. No blood going to your brain causes you first to pass out and then your organs fail quickly.   I'm sorry for your loss. If I were you, I would stick to the idea that he passed out right away and died within minutes, painlessly."

Can't transcribe words when spoken to me if they are longer than 4-5 letters (i.e. a last name I\u2019m supposed to input into a database.) Basically, minimal short-term memory. Possibly a learning disability? Height: 5'4  Weight: 130  Gender: F  Race: White  Medications: none currently, most recent ones were risperidone and lamictal. Discontinued about six months ago due to lack of substantial results with no major emotional changes as a result.  Smoking status: vape often. About a juul pod a day.  Previous medical issues: mentioned below. Few different diagnoses over the years. ADHD first (childhood), then they added major depressive disorder (~2015). In 2018, they both got thrown out and replaced with Bipolar II.   Duration of complaint: Always, really. I feel like it wasn't as bad in elementary school, or maybe it just wasn't something I was really bothered by/aware of. By middle/high school, it was definitely noticeable to me.  Complaint:  I consistently test above average academically. I hate even saying that, but it\u2019s relevant to this concern. I learn easily, I understand easily, I remember LONG-term easily.  I cannot input a debit/credit card number recited to me into our work database if they don\u2019t pause in between groups of numbers. I cannot record a last name or an unfamiliar word down if it isn\u2019t spelled out to me both slowly and a few letters at a time. I absolutely CANNOT verbally spell, though spelling isn\u2019t a problem at all when writing. I cannot visually interpret XYZ grids whatsoever, and I\u2019m proficient at math. I also can\u2019t do division or multiplication in my head. Addition/subtraction over two places is also incredibly difficult if any numbers need to be carried.  Essentially, any thinking process where I have to go past three, maybe four small steps at a time, I forget where I\u2019m at entirely and have to start all over. It\u2019s like my RAM is nearly non-existent. Everything I do on paper works out great because it can\u2019t disappear- it\u2019s permanently on the page. Anything requiring on-the-spot, short-term memory? Forget it... literally.  I have a childhood diagnosis of ADHD. Got diagnosed with major depressive disorder around 21. After a major depressive episode/suicidal issue a few years after that, my psychiatrist shifted my diagnosis/medication to bipolar II. This diagnostic shift was predicated on an event I described when I was 18, where after a traumatic life event (first major death of a loved one), I had a solid month of extremely erratic, reckless and very uncharacteristic behavior combined with a lack of sleep or need/desire for it. Fit every definition I've read of a manic episode, and the age was appropriate for symptoms to start. I haven't had one since, however.   I stopped taking these bipolar medications around six months ago because they weren\u2019t very effective for me in general and I felt they were making focusing on schoolwork even more difficult (caused me to feel lethargic, emotionally numb, sleepy, disinterested, etc. Common side effects.) I definitely have long-standing depression issues, but no present mania or hypomania. I occasionally get bursts of energy/feeling 'up'/overconfidence, but they usually last anywhere from 1-6 hours before they go away entirely. Never days at a time since that manic episode at 18.  I haven\u2019t found anything that falls beneath the scope of either ADHD or bipolar to explain this. Doctors and my past mental health team sort of brushed it off in the face of treating my depression. I just want to know what this specifically is. It feels bigger than just the symptoms described. It\u2019s like I can feel my brain hit some weird wall whenever I try to think steps or moves ahead.  Speaking of which, I\u2019ll throw in one last example. Cannot do strategy games like chess. I just lose my future plans two imagined steps in. They can\u2019t be recalled; they just disappear.  Is this (maybe) a learning disability? What am I (potentially) dealing with?\n\nAssistant:"

I have constant nerve pain through my limbs that feel akin to electric shocks.   Here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019ve been to a few doctors.

Results Were Surprising    Age: 31  Sex: M  Height: 6'6\"  Weight: 250 Athletic  Race: White/Caucasian  Duration: 4 1/2 Months  Location: Lungs/Upper Respiratory, Upper G/I  Current Diagnosis: **Stage 4 Aggressive Gastro-Intestinal Cancer**  Current Meds: Pain Killers, Diuretics  As needed Meds: Lidocaine Patches, Anti-Nausea,  M**elatonin** sleep aid  Original:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/c2ls61/chronic\\_cough\\_and\\_now\\_coughing\\_up\\_blood\\_after/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&utm\\_source=share   So after spending some time at an Urgent Care, getting some scans lined up and trying to be patient, I woke up one morning to pain and compression over my chest. Urgent Care Docs had advised me that any escalation of symptoms should mean I go to the Emergency Room. Once there they almost immediately checked me into the ICU for observation and began running every test you could name. For the next 4/5 days I did just an unreal number of scans, 2 biopsies, and they drew enough blood to fill a small pool. Pain escalated daily while there so finding a solution was a running theme. So after a lot of trails here's what they found:  Current: Stage 4 Aggressive Metastatic Gastrointestinal Cancer ( Adenocarcinoma )  Previous: Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation   After doing a Lymph Node & Bone Marrow Biopsy they found my marrow filled to capacity with dead cancer cells. This pointed them in the right direction. My platelets were crashing daily (20,000 at admission) and I've got inflamed lymph nodes throughout my chest cavity which is one source of my (significant and at time escalating) pain. Its infiltrated my lungs and several vertebrae along my spine (causing vertebrae to show signs of Osteopenia) . Weirdly enough there's no noticeable tumor/mass/lump they can trace it back to. It's kind of just spread throughout (described as Adenocarcinoma) , though they were finally able to locate a small ulcer in my stomach that allowed them to finally be able to classify it. I've currently just completed my 3rd (now weekly) round of chemo (we started asap when other options such as clinical trials were deemed a non-option) and we've been able to stabilize a number of things (blood factors such as platelets, hemoglobin and the like) along the way. Many of my blood counts are still in the trash so clinical trails are not currently an option. In early stages of my 3 weeks hospital visit I was in a state called **DIC (**Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) which caused me to act like something akin to a blood squirt gun if i bled. Essentialy it screws with you clotting factors and any bleeding event is an issue. Any procedure became an issue and many my numbers were artifically raised in order to attempt anything that would cause me to bleed. Fortunately after a week of treatments and what felt like several wheel barrows of infusions we kicked my body out of D.I.C and am more or less clotting normally. Fun story: early one morning after the vampires took their daily does of my blood a CNA came in to do a routine vitals check. This particular morning they took 2 unique sets of blood samples plus a rather large sample for testing against infectious disease. This was also kind of at the height of my \"he's not clotting\" phase. During the blood pressure check it popped open all the fresh holes in my arm, causing them to bleed and freaked/surprised the CNA. Made me laugh. (end of story).  Immunotherapy is what my Oncologist are banking on right now so crossing my fingers. Chemo is causing reasonable progress (numbers are low but stable) so we're staying the course for now. My personal mid->long term goal is to find an alternative to opiates for pain management (who the hell knows why a person tolerates opiates for a buzz cause constipation sucks!!!) so looking at alternatives (THC pills potentially or preferably resolving the issue that's causing me pain)  I've been discharged from the hospital after 3 weeks so now I'm working to find a routine that works. Losing weight so a short term goal is stopping that (I'm rather tall and (was) muscular so my bodies nuking whatever calories I put in and I'm not putting in a lot due to general nausea, but smoothies have been my friend. Please let me know if you have any questions or advice.. I'll answer what I can and absorb what reasonable advice I read.\n\nAssistant:"

While I do agree with him that I did lack a bit of fundamental knowledge but am I being judged a little too hard for this? I've been doing well in school but the industry design game was wayyy more complicated than anything i've seen in school?

Lets start from the foundation up.   The GC will hire a firm that specializes in earth moving and soil preparation.  The firm will have foreman, supers who have presumably been doing this for years and are teaching younger leadsman and laborers how to read the geotechnical report and comply with the geotechnical requirements.  The firm(s) might even have a university educated project engineer/project manager also familiar with the technical specifications.   Moving to the foundation, the GC will hire a firm that does rebar and concrete work. They are familiar with rebar standards, specifications and code and will fabricate and create shop drawings in compliance with the structural engineers specifications.   Moving to columns, if the structure is concrete that same firm who worked on the foundation may work on the columns. But lets assume its a steel building. the GC will hire a trade that again specializes in steel work. Foreman/Supers doing steel for their careers. In my part of the US, we often defer simple connection design to the steel fabricator too. The steel fabricator will have a engineer in house that designs the building connections (for simple ones). He or she will be a registered P.E.   This process repeats for each trade until the building structure is completed. There are specific trades too for architectural components and mechanical/electrical/plumbing.   Ultimately it comes down to standardization, codes, and regulations.

I'm 10 months into my first engineering job and I'm completely burnt out.  I got into engineering because I like solving problems.  Running experiments, analyzing data, and making decisions based on that data has always come naturally to me.  I just can't keep up with all of the issues I'm running into as a new engineer and in the last 10 months of working as a process engineer, there hasn't been one hour of one day that I haven't felt completely overwhelmed and in over my head.  Every day I deal with new fires that come up in MRB and am expected to do these root cause analysis projects on them all.  At this point, I have 5 long-term projects and about 8 short-term RCA projects that I'm having to juggle around daily manufacturing issues.  I'm not getting anything done and upper management is getting frustrated with the lack of progress, but I'm just completely overwhelmed.    On top of that, I was thrown into a new daily role of making formulation changes to our base material with zero training and no engineering passdown (I have an entire post about this already).  Even when I can get the properties in spec, the operators are complaining that it isn't good enough.  I'm trying so hard to get this figured out and in 2 months I haven't had one day where everything worked.    Is it supposed to be like this?  Am I just not good enough at handling the workload that an engineer can expect?  I don't know what I'll do with myself if I can't continue to be an engineer, but at this point I just can't keep going.  Did I really work so hard to get here just to fail?\n\nAssistant:"

            {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": " This is a popular question that I don't think I've ever really tackled head-on, although elements of it have come up in previous answers of mine. A point of mild amusement: all summer long (in the northern hemisphere) we get questions about how they managed in the heat in such warm clothes, and all winter long we get questions about how they managed to keep warm in the cold.  For a start, as I explained in Why is most historical clothing so complicated? Victorian clothing was not really that \"painfully restrictive and heavily layered\". Women wore a cotton chemise with the corset over it and a pair of long drawers, then a number of starched petticoats or a hoop skirt or bustle, depending on the point in the period, and then their dress; despite the popular impression, corsets were not immobilizing or debilitating. (There were specific corsets to allow for riding horses, and eventually corsets specifically for sports; see my answer on them here.) The starch in the petticoats kept them from tangling the legs and structured skirt supports were also light and facilitated movement. Men wore a shirt with some form of lower-body underwear, trousers, a vest/waistcoat, and a coat. Is that really so much?  The very poor tended to wear clothing that was better for the summer than the winter, since the cheaper fabrics were flimsier and thinner; they had to do more work to layer up when it was cold, and would merely tend to roll up sleeves, etc. in the heat. For those who could afford to have separate wardrobes for different seasons - or even just \"a summer suit\" and \"a winter suit\" - alterations were made to clothes. Men could wear suits of lighter colors and fabrics during the summer - for instance, the stereotypical white linen suit of the Southern (American) gentleman. Someone who was not wealthy might go for something a bit more practical, like a brown serge (cotton twill) or, by the 1890s, seersucker. Women might wear gowns made of sheer cotton, silk, wool, or a blend and sleeves and bodices could be made fuller, all of which would make clothing lighter and airier. By the end of the era, there were also ventilated corsets (as described in the previous link). And in the end, if it were really, really hot, people could stay at home in partial undress.  The last part of the issue \"is more of a science answer than a history answer\": the properties of natural fibers and synthetics are such that clothing made of linen, cotton, and wool are more breathable in the summer than polyester and similar man-made fabrics. Even heavier wools can breathe, but wool can also be made in tropical weights for suits and in sheer challises and bar\u00e8ges for gowns. There is also a decent amount of anecdotal evidence from reenactors that baring more skin doesn't make much of a difference when it's 80+ degrees, that covering up to some extent reduces the heat of the sun, and that avoiding the extremes of air conditioning makes the heat less oppressive in contrast. (I have also found this to be the case, personally.)  Now to add in some examples of lighter summer clothes:  Man's white linen frock coat, 1840-1855; Augusta Auctions  \"Mrs. Adrian Bauker Holmes\" (in a white muslin gown with an open neckline), by Charles Wesley Jarvis, ca. 1850; MMA 13.21.8  Bonnet, ca. 1855; MMA 2009.300.5661 - straw was already a lighter bonnet and hat material worn in the summer to keep from insulating the head too much, and straw could be interspersed with horsehair braid for aesthetics and to let more air in  Bodice of sheer white cotton, ca. 1865; MMA 2009.300.5241  Woman's ensemble, 1864-1867; LACMA M.2007.211.944a-c and a very similar afternoon dress, ca. 1867; MFIT P90.22.2  Semisheer dress, ca. 1870; Rijksmuseum BK-1978-260  \"Spring\", by Philippe-Jacques Linder, ca. 1875; CAI 1955.792  Tennis dress, ca. 1885; LACMA M.2007.211.782a-b  (Sorry, mostly women's, I just don't stockpile the men's images as much!)"

                "content": " It depends on the time and the place.  In France, the French government retained sovereignty over the whole country. After the Battle of France had been decisively lost in 1940, the French Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud, tried and failed to convince the rest of the cabinet to evacuate the government to Algeria or Britain and continue fighting from there. Reynaud resigned rather than carry out the cabinet's desire to sue for peace, and the President (Albert Lebrun) appointed Marshall Philippe Petain (the leader of the surrender faction in the cabinet) to replace him. Petain asked Germany for an armistice, which Germany granted on terms that amounted to a surrender. Among other provisions, Northern and Western France (about 60% of Metropolitan France, including Paris) would be occupied by Germany until a final peace treaty was agreed (it never was, nor were negotiations ever begun in earnest), and France would be assessed an exorbitant fee to pay for the occupation. The rest of France (including the colonies) would remain unoccupied under the direct control of Petain's government.  Petain set up a new capital in Vichy, a small resort town in the unoccupied zone. There, the French Parliament voted itself out of existence and granted Petain dictatorial powers (ending the Third Republic and establishing what we now refer to as Vichy France). In the unoccupied zone, citizens paid their taxes as normal, except they were sent to Vichy instead of Paris. In the occupied zone, the German military and the French civilian administration had overlapping jurisdiction: the French bureaucrats still nominally worked for the government in Vichy, but they were required by the terms of the occupation to follow the policies of the occupation authorities. In the occupied zone, then, taxes were still assessed according to French law, by administrators who worked for the French government, but they operated under the direction and supervision of the German military. In practice, this supervision seemed to be relatively light: Petain's government's policies were aligned enough with German interests, and the German occupation's administrative resources were small enough, that the Germans mostly let Vichy set policy for the occupied zone. In both zones, the taxes went to Vichy, and in accordance with the armistice agreement, Vichy paid Germany the agreed-upon costs of the occupation (which were much higher than the actual costs, so Germany turned a substantial profit).  In November 1942, after Britain, America, and anti-Vichy French exile forces (\"Free France\") successfully invaded France's North African colonies (Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia), Germany executed Case Anton, occupying the remainder of Metropolitan France. The Vichy government remained in operation, however, and the French civilian administration continued running under German occupation.  Nazi-occupied Poland was divided up into two zones (plus a third zone in the East, which was annexed by the Soviet Union). Northern and Western Poland (a bit past the pre-WW1 borders of Imperial Germany) were annexed to the German Reich. They were integral parts of Germany, and were administered and taxed directly by the German government under German law and Nazi policy. The remainder of Poland was put under a special German occupation administration called the General Government, lead by a senior Nazi Party official (Hans Frank) who served as Governor-General of Poland. Frank and the other senior officials of the General Government ruled by decree, and they administered the territory mostly through imported German officials. The existing Polish civilian police were drafted into German service under German senior officers (mostly from the German civilian police) and used to help enforce the General Government's rule. The General Government collected taxes for its own internal use, and as with Vichy, they also sent a substantial portion of their revenue to Germany, officially as a reimbursement for the costs of the occupation.  **Sources:**  * Shirer, William, *The Collapse of the Third Republic*, 1969 * Mazower, Mark, *Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe*, 2008"

I'll try to address them all, though given the scope, I've left out some details.  > *Specifically, were there Southerners on it?*  ..  > *I\u2019m assuming some of the Supreme Court justices were Southerners.*  **THERE WERE EIGHT JUSTICES, INCLUDING FOUR FROM SLAVE STATES, AND ONE EMPTY SEAT**  At the time of Lincoln's election, there were eight living Supreme Court justices. One, Peter Vivian Daniel, a Democrat from Virginia, had died on May 31, 1860, during that year's Presidential campaign. President James Buchanan did not nominate a replacement before Election Day. His party was deeply divided as it was, with a Democratic National Convention less than a month before Daniel's death failing to nominate a presidential candidate. This resulted in a second convention already scheduled just a couple of weeks after Daniel died. And ultimately, that convention also failed, the Democrats could not unify, and they nominated two different presidential candidates at competing conventions.   Rather than risking a campaign issue that might aid the Democrats' opponents and further aggravate the Democrats' divide, Buchanan decided not to nominate anybody until after the election. Of course, immediately after the election, the Secession Crisis erupted, making it even more difficult for Buchanan to actually get anybody through, and the Supreme Court nomination took a back seat. Buchanan finally did make a nomination less than a month before leaving office. On February 5, 1861, he nominated Jeremiah Black but the nomination failed by a vote of 25-26 on February 21. (Black was Buchanan's Attorney General, though stepping in as Secretary of State in the administration's final weeks when SoS Lewis Cass resigned in December 1860 over Buchanan's handling of the Fort Sumter issue. Unlike Cass, Black was very much a \"Doughface\".)  **THERE WERE SEVEN DEMOCRATS AND ONE CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN ON THE BENCH**  Of the eight living justices, the court was decidedly conservative. All eight justices had been nominated by Democratic presidents. Only one non-Democrat was on the court - John McLean, the Whig-turned-conservative Republican, though even he had been nominated to the court by Andrew Jackson.   The other seven were all conservative Democrats, though their brands of conservatism followed the geographic North/South line. Nathan Clifford, Robert Cooper Grier, and Samuel Nelson were Northern Democrats whose pre-war rulings were very much in keeping with what might be expected of Northern Democrats. John Catron, James Moore Wayne, John Archibald Campbell, and Chief Justice Roger B. Taney were all Southern Democrats whose rulings reflected that partisanship - though Taney was actually from a slaveholding family from the non-seceding slave state of Maryland.  The other three - Catron, Wayne, and Campbell - were all from states that seceded (Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama, respectively). Of them, only Campbell actually resigned, and he waited over three months after Alabama seceded to actually hand in his resignation (after Fort Sumter).  > *Were they viewed skeptically by their colleagues if they stayed?*  **THE JUSTICES TRIED TO KEEP THE COURT INTACT**  No, in fact, there was an effort by the Northern Democrats to try to ensure that the three secession-state Democrats remained on the court. McLean, too, was somewhat involved in making sure the court stayed united, but it was really Samuel Nelson of New York who took the lead. Rather than antagonism, there was something of a camaraderie among them, that they didn't want to make the situation worse, and \"break up the court\". They were also all quite old, with six of them having been serving on the court between 15 and 30 years already. Though they had disagreements about law sometimes, socially, they all got along. (A few years earlier, Benjamin Curtis resigned after the *Dred Scott* decision, after having a falling out with Taney, but that's another story).   There were a couple of news reports in April 1861 that Campbell, Wayne, and Taney were going to resign en masse and issue a statement, first reported in the *Richmond Examiner* and *Philadedlphia Inquirer*, but these reports were pretty quickly discredited as inaccurate. Of the eight justices, the only one who really considered resigning is the one who did, and that was Campbell. Campbell would even write later on about telling Wayne of his decision, and while Wayne didn't try to stop him, he disagreed with him, and Campbell defended Wayne's own decision to stay on the court.  Outside their colleagues, there was some criticism by the press. When Campbell took his time in leaving Washington after resigning his seat, the *New York Post* called him a \"convenient spy for the Montgomery mutineers\". On the flipside, when Wayne remained on the court after the war started, the New York newspapers all praised his decision, while Atlanta's *Southern Confederacy* newspaper wrote: \"Georgia does not claim him, and he is no more of us\".  > *Did they remain loyal to the union or leave to join the Confederacy?*  ..  > *Do we know about their thoughts and their decisions?*  Yes, and I'm taking \"decisions\" here to mean their decision to stay on or leave the court. If you're asking about their history of Supreme Court case decisions, that's another matter, but to put it briefly, all except McLean were conservative Democrats, and McLean was a rather conservative Republican - in comparison to a moderate like Abraham Lincoln and a progressive like Sen. Benjamin Wade of Ohio. Though to the South, McLean was way too radical.   Again, there were three justices from seceding states on the court during the Secession Crisis - Catron of Tennessee, Wayne of Georgia, and Campbell of Alabama. And again, of the three, the only one who seriously considered resigning was the one who did, Campbell.  Nobody on the court issued a press release or anything giving a direct reason for deciding to stay or resign. But we can glean from their actions and writings what they believed.  **JOHN CATRON**  At the time of the Civil War, Supreme Court justices actually had two jobs. In February and August, they sat in session with the Supreme Court. At other parts of the year, each sat in session as one of the Circuit Court justices. Even now, each SCOTUS judge is assigned to overseeing one of the nine circuits, but in those days, the SCOTUS judge doubled as an actual Circuit Judge whenever their assigned circuit was in session.  On July 10, 1861, during John Catron's duties as a circuit court judge, he issued what is known as \"The Charge of Judge Catron to the Grand Jury at St. Louis\". These were jury instructions in which he essentially told a grand jury to treat acts committed by Confederates against the U.S. government as treason against the Constitution:  > \"...[T]he crime [of treason] is committed whenever war against the United States by those owing allegiance thereto, is raised, created, made or carried on; or when, daring a war, they adhere to the enemy, giving him aid and comfort. The terms 'levying war' embrace not merely the act of formal or declared war, but any combination, in military array, forcibly to prevent or oppose, generally, the execution of a provision either of the United States Constitution, or a United States statute: or forcibly to subvert the United States Government or any department thereof; or by force to procure the repeal or alteration of the Constitution or laws; if such combination be accompanied or followed by an act of forcible opposition in pursuance of the treasonable design.\"  If that's too obscure, the July 21, 1861, edition of the *Daily Nashville Patriot* printed Catron's Charge at length, and prefaced it with:  > \"We lay before our readers this morning that portion of the charge of Judge Catron to the Grand Jury at St. Louis on the 10th [of July 1861], which relates to the crime of treason. According to the definition of the learned Judge the volunteers of the State of Tennessee are traitors in arms against their Government, and liable to be punished as such. Judge Catron is a citizen of Tennessee, and the Confederate States, yet he clings to his position under the Federal Government, and gives it aid and comfort by holding its courts, and holding over the heads of our patriotic volunteers, struggling in the cause of liberty and independence, the penalties of treason.\"   Just three months after Fort Sumter, Catron was telling a jury in that hotbed of conflict, Missouri, to consider Confederates as traitors if they were to try to resist the enforcement of U.S. Constitutional law."

                "content": " There are two ways to attack the subject at the heart of your excellent question: by using early medieval primary sources (which are always too rare) and by considering early modern folklore collected in the North Sea area and projecting backwards (which has its own problems). At the heart of the problem with projecting backwards using early modern sources is that folklore is not monolithic, by its nature. Folk traditions, beliefs, and the narratives that express those beliefs are subject to change because there is no single dogmatic doctrine that provides an anchor from which the tradition cannot drift. Similarly, it is too easy - and error ridden - to generalize about traditions using rare early-medieval sources. The two types of evidence provide glimpses at a tradition in motion, and yet, they do point to some observations.  There is a reasonably homogeneous tradition of supernatural beings, which people believed lived in family groups and/or communities and which is documented in historic and pre-modern professional collections, ranging from wherever Scandinavian languages are spoken, Britain, Ireland, nearby islands, and Brittany.  Because this generic tradition (acknowledging enormous variation over time and geography and also a wide variety of terms for the entities) is so widespread and appears in some of the oldest documents from the area, so that it is reasonable to conclude that the roots of the tradition is pre-conversion.   At the same time, it seems inevitable that conversion affected the tradition and shaped it over time. That said, the Church appears to have failed at the one thing it strived to achieve - namely, to group these supernatural beings together with the forces of evil. We see evidence of this effort in the passage in the Anglo-Saxon poem, Beowulf, when the poet writes that elves, like the monster Grendel, were descendants of Cain:  >From him the evil brood were all born,  >Giants and elves and evil spirits,  >And also the giants who fought against God  >For a long time; He paid them retribution for that.  That clerical point of view did not generally affect the folk tradition, which maintained that the elves (fairies, sidhe, pixies, hidden folk, or other names) were neither good nor evil. Mind you, people feared them, for they were extraordinarily dangerous and were capable of inflicting terrible harm, not the least of which was abduction, which could last for eternity and deprive the poor soul of salvation. The elves had to be treated with caution, respect, and deference, and most of all, they needed to be avoided. But they were not in league with Satan - that was a different kettle of supernatural beings.  In pre-modern collections from North Sea cultures, we find numerous explanations of the origin of the elves (with all their names), some of which are placed in a Biblical context: the elves were angels who refused to take a side in the battle between God and Satan, so they were cast out of heaven to live on earth (but not Hell) apart from the Christian struggle between good and evil; or the elves were the children of Eve who, when she realized God was coming for a visit, was only able to clean some of her children, and so she hid the others, and God answered that those who were hidden from Him would be hidden from mankind for all time. At the same time, there is a widespread legend that tells of the possible salvation of the elves: a young man is traveling through the forest and sees the elves celebrating, so he calls out and says that they have no reason to celebrate since they cannot know salvation, at which point the elves begin to cry. He goes home and tells his father what happened, and his father tells him to return with word that they will know salvation, which the boy does, and the elves resume their party. Some times the boy tells them that they have no more chance at salvation than does his walking stick have a chance to sprout leaves. The next morning the walking stick is full of leaves, and so the boy goes back and tells the elves the news.  The repeated message in these stories is that the elves are not evil, and that if they lean in one direction or the other, it is on the side of salvation. The Church, however, persisted in its attempt to say that all supernatural beings not specifically identified as being on God's side in the bible are by necessity on the side of evil - maintaining a strict division of the universe into those two halves. During the witch trials, for example, people could be accused of cavorting with the elves, with the consequence being the same as cavorting the demons. Despite that dark chapter in folk belief, the folk persisted in seeing the elves as theologically neutral, and while they were to be feared, there were also stories of these supernatural beings rewarding people of good character and generosity.  That leaves us with the odd tradition of incorporating the word \"Aelf\" into Anglo-Saxon names - Alfred, being one of the more common that descends to this time. There can be no question that people understood the meaning of these names, but that does not mean that they took them to mean that in a literal way. We have names including Rose and Marigold, but that doesn't mean that we automatically think of those flowers when we encounter those people. I knew a fellow named, of all things, Rex King (parents with a sense of humor or a lack of imagination!), and all his schoolmates no doubt understood that Rex meant king, but we didn't think along those terms when we encountered him - or at least I didn't.   It has always struck me as odd that the Anglo-Saxon people might be summoning dangerous supernatural beings with a name that uses their name, but we have to set that aside as something that apparently cannot be resolved, and we must merely accept the fact that the Anglo-Saxon naming tradition included this word, and people did not think of it as taunting the dangerous supernatural beings.  edit: Thanks for the anonymous gilding of the answer - and for the platinum! Much appreciated!"

History is never written in isolation, and public history in particular must be aware of and engaged with current political concerns. This ethos has applied both to the operation of our forum and to our engagement with significant events.  Years of moderating the subreddit have demonstrated that calls for a historical methodology free of contemporary concerns achieve little more than silencing already marginalized narratives. Likewise, many of us on the mod team and panel of flairs do not have the privilege of separating our own personal work from weighty political issues.  Last week, Dr. James Sweet, president of the American Historical Association, published a column for the AHA\u2019s newsmagazine *Perspectives on History* titled \u201cIs History History? Identity Politics and Teleologies of the Present\u201d. Sweet uses the column to address historians whom he believes have given into \u201cthe allure of political relevance\u201d and now \u201cforeshorten or shape history to justify rather than inform contemporary political positions.\u201d The article quickly caught the attention of academics on social media, who have criticized it for dismissing the work of Black authors, for being ignorant of the current political situation, and for employing an uncritical notion of \"presentism\" itself. Sweet\u2019s response two days later, now appended above the column, apologized for his \u201cham-fisted attempt at provocation\u201d but drew further ire for only addressing the harm he didn\u2019t intend to cause and not the ideas that caused that harm.  In response to this ongoing controversy, today\u2019s Monday Methods is a space to provide some much-needed context for the complex historical questions Sweet provokes and discuss the implications of such a statement from the head of one of the field\u2019s most significant organizations.

                "content": " You've asked a few big questions there! I'm going to kind of blend them all together, since they are all somewhat connected.  One of the crucial things about the foreign volunteering phenomenon in Spain is that it happened in waves. Many of the earliest foreigners who fought were either already in Spain when the conflict broke out, or made their way there using their own means or informal networks, and this remained the norm in the first few months of the conflict. This meant that the initial wave of volunteers could be quite heterogeneous, covering not just idealists (for a quite varied set of ideals at this point) but also mercenaries and adventurers who saw the conflict itself as the opportunity rather than the political stakes. Those who made it to Spain integrated themselves into the haphazard structures of the Republican forces as best they could, generally by attaching themselves to whatever militia column best reflected their beliefs and/or would take them. It's important to remember just how chaotic the Republican state and armed forces were in these crucial early weeks - there was no formal centralised process, and getting to fight was more about convincing local militia, political party or trade union leaders that they should trust you and let you join them.  However, in autumn 1936, volunteering started to change drastically. This was partly due to the Republican Government gradually re-establishing itself as a cohesive state, but mostly because the Soviet Union made a decision to actively intervene to support the Republic. Part of this intervention involved selling arms and supplies, providing a safe(ish) home for Spanish gold reserves to finance further overseas purchases and sending military advisors and specialists. For our purposes though, the key decision was that instead of trying to send an entire army to Spain to fight - which Stalin had little desire and most importantly limited capacity to do - they would try and facilitate the recruitment of international volunteers with military experience to bolster the inexperienced and poorly (barely) trained Spanish militias.   This decision was significant because the USSR had spent much of its existence building an international network of communist organisations. This was the Communist International (usually referred to as Comintern), which was based in Moscow and sought to guide and coordinate communist groups around the world. It was the exact kind of network that could sustain a widespread recruitment effort, with experience in operating relatively clandestinely and in many cases illegally, and fostering connections across borders between individuals and affiliated organisations. Culturally, interwar communism was also a natural home for those who might *want* to volunteer - these were organisations that actively sought to emulate and follow the Bolshevik revolutionary model, seeking to foster an elite, disciplined and politically united vanguard of the proletariat. Communists' belligerent attitude towards fascism - advocating confrontation and containment both internationally and on the streets - also meant that communist parties were generally home to those who were keenest to take direct, decisive action against fascism.  The Comintern was put in charge of organising this international army, using its national affiliates to recruit volunteers, its transnational connections to get them Spain and its elite operatives as the military and political leadership. Even when France closed its borders with Spain, the Comintern (and the Communist Party of France) were able to set up an effective system to smuggle volunteers south from Paris and across the Pyrenees. Unlike the first wave of volunteers, this new wave would join dedicated international formations that became known as the International Brigades. They never had a complete monopoly over foreigners fighting for the Republic, but the bulk of foreign volunteers (about 90%) ended up in their ranks. This was due in part to their absorbing many of the ad hoc international formations, but also because the Comintern recruitment networks were much better organised, and the number of volunteers rapidly increased over the winter of 1936-7, with smaller but significant flows being sustained through to spring 1938.  Comintern's involvement meant that the volunteers themselves became more homogenous, both politically and socially. George Orwell is actually a good example of how that might happen - he had applied to join the International Brigades in London, but failed to convince the Communist Party of Great Britain that he was politically reliable enough - they weren't massive fans of his recent writing (this was pre-Animal Fram and 1984, the issue was more that they saw Orwell as middle-class dilettante), and figured he just wanted to go to Spain so he could write about it rather than being fully dedicated to the cause. Orwell instead managing to leverage connections with the British Independent Labour Party, which in turn had connections with a small Spanish revolutionary party (the POUM), and Orwell was able to join a small group of non-communist international volunteers serving in their militia (Hemingway, for the record, did not actually fight in Spain, but went there as a journalist).   The result was that the International Brigades were dominated by the Comintern, with national units generally run by their respective national communist parties (the American Abraham Lincoln Battalion, for instance, was dominated by Communist Party of the USA leaders). Not every volunteer from this point onwards *was* a formal member of a communist party - depending on the national grouping, the figure was usually somewhere between 40-60% - but even those who weren't formal members were those considered politically reliable by the Party (unlike Orwell) and had broadly accepted that the communist policy of confronting fascism was the correct one. While these units were not always politically harmonious in practice, not least because they went through some brutal, disillusioning experiences, they were a far cry from the very varied array of volunteers that first went to Spain. This was a Stalinist army in terms of culture, politics and organisation.  One important caveat to end on here is that it might be tempting to read 'Stalinist' in particular ways here (particularly given the connection with Orwell, who left the conflict as a dedicated anti-Stalinist). It's important to acknowledge though that the Spanish Civil War happened at a key moment of transition for Stalinism - the Great Purge kicked off *during* the war, and in any case, foreign adherents to communism were generally attracted to an imagined, idealised version of Stalinism and the Soviet Union, who took the pretensions of Soviet democracy under Stalin as real. While there were undoubtedly politically dark sides to the International Brigades - the obsession with Trotskyists and other potential enemies within is very obvious in the source material - for the most part, the foreign communist volunteers were trying to run the International Brigades as they imagined their idealised Bolsheviks might, rather than trying to emulate the reality of Stalin's rule.  (while I've touched indirectly on some of the reasons why Spain saw such an unprecedentedly large number of volunteers, if you're after a more specific treatment of the question, I answered it in quite a bit of depth here)."

The Air Force, being a very new element to warfare, was considered to be very gentlemanly, and as a POW, especially one of high rank, he would be normally be accorded many luxuries and privileges. Even in the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of POW is also very detailed about the treatment of POWs, and does accord more rights and privileges to POWs of higher rank, with the most being accorded to Generals, as Goering was. The Allies saw Goering as a criminal, but he no doubt saw himself as simply another military member, and entitled to the full rights of the convention, and not to be treated as a criminal.  Even during WWII, the Luftwaffe handled Allied POWs from the Air Force, who were generally treated better than their Army or Navy counterparts, when under the supervision of the Luftwaffe.   As far as Goering himself, if you read his confessions and testimony at Nuremberg, he's pretty unabashedly unapologetic for his actions. As a General in a time of war, he would expect to be treated as a POW of high rank, not as a murderer on trial.   You also have to look at the Nuremberg trials in the context of the time. The crimes they were being accused of were LITERALLY the very first time anyone were put on trial for Crimes Against Humanity, and the trial of this kind and scope were completely without precedent. For someone who obviously feels their actions were justified in the context of a war, and feels they are no worse than the enemies they faced in the battlefield, how must they have felt to be told that their actions are so heinous, so terrible, that entirely new laws must be written just to put them on trial for them?   We have the luxury of hindsight in this, but when the information of the Holocaust was being released, no one knew what to do. Eisenhower ordered as much footage to be taken as possibly, because he knew no one would believe the size and scope of it. Given the number of holocaust deniers today, it seems a sensible idea. But at the time, it was unfathomable and people couldn't believe that something so horrific could have happened. It wasn't even imaginable. Even Germans living within proximity of a concentration camp didn't always know what was happening, or certainly the full extent of it.   Then you take the attitude towards Jews in general. Not even in Germany, but everywhere in the world. Germany tried to deport millions of Jews prior to the war, but most countries refused, or only took a small number. In Canada, the Immigration minister at the time was infamously quoted as saying \"None is too many\" with regards to allowing Jewish refugees into Canada. In the US there were similar attitudes of anti-semitism, and a dislike of Jewish immigration. While the Allies didn't know the full extent of the Holocaust, they did know some of it, and bear some responsibility for failing to act earlier and more decisively to get Jews out of Europe. Goering would have known all this, and known the very publicly-expressed anti-Semitic sentiments of the Allies, and their actions against Jewish immigration, so it would seem somewhat hypocritical to be put on trial by people who are somewhat complicit (if only by inaction or neglect) in the crimes they're accusing you of."

                "content": " \"The age of cannons and sails and pirates\" is pretty broad, but I think we can fairly say that between a period of say 1650 or so and 1805 or so, naval battles were often quite lethal to the people involved. The caveat here of course is that the tactics used and the motivation of the people involved ebbed and flowed over time, and so there's not really a straight line we can draw among different encounters.   Just to set our parameters: I'm picking 1650ish to bound this on the early end because the first Anglo-Dutch war started in 1652, and the three conflicts (1652-54, 1665-67 and 1672-74) saw the development and codification of what we generally refer to as line-of-battle tactics for fleet engagements.   I'm picking 1805 as the bound on the other end because, of course, the battle of Trafalgar saw a complete abandonment of those tactics and a decisive victory for Britain.   The Anglo-Dutch wars saw the first widespread use of the line-of-battle tactic that would dominate naval tactics for the next 150 years or so. The exact origin of the idea that you would line up ships front to rear and engage the enemy's line arranged in the same way is pretty well disputed -- some people trace this back to 1500, others say that Maarten Tromp used the tactic in 1639 -- but for our purposes that's kind of a moot point, because the line-of-battle tactics used in the Anglo-Dutch wars often produced long-running engagements, many of which resulted in simple mutual exhaustion on both sides. If both sides kept to a strict line, engagements usually ran a fairly regular course of the ships passing one another and firing away until one fleet edged away, enough ships were damaged that the rest tried to flee, or darkness fell and one side broke off the battle.   If that didn't happen, though, and a line became disordered due to damage, lack of leadership, flaws in weather, etc., the battle could turn quite quickly in favor of one side or the other. The Four Days' Battle is probably a good and also bad example of this -- it's quite unusual in being the largest battle of the Age of Sail, though it's not well known, and resulted in a decisive English defeat in the second Anglo-Dutch war.   It was fought from 11-14 June 1666 (New Style) with 54 ships on the English side against 84 on the Dutch side. The English, commanded by George Monck (the duke of Albemarle) decided to attack the numerically superior Dutch fleet commanded by Michiel de Ruyter in hopes of defeating them in detail before the Dutch could combine. In the event, on the first day Albermarle did not double up or fall on a portion of the Dutch fleet but fought a conventional battle at range, to his disadvantage.   On the second day, the ships again formed lines but seem to have quite often cut through one line or the other to attempt to engage with some numerical superiority; the English fleet suffered heavily in this encounter. Admiral de Ruyter's ship was badly damaged and he withdrew from the fighting, but at the end of the day the English fleet was reduced to only 29 ships that were battle-worthy. Albermarle decided to withdraw to the west, and on the third day the Dutch fleet gave chase but stayed out of range, fearing the large English stern-chasers. Albermale's course took the fleet over the Galloper shoal, and several ships grounded, including Admiral George Ayscue's *Prince Royal*; his men, panicking, forced him to surrender the ship. He was, and remains, the highest-ranking English naval officer to have been captured by an enemy.   On the fourth day, the English fleet received some reinforcements, including fireships, and decided to attack the Dutch fleet. Both sides realized that this might be the decisive battle of the war. The English attacked from leeward, in an unfortunate position for a sea-fight, and the Dutch fleet was able to encircle and overwhelm them. Sir Christopher Myngs, taking over as admiral of the van from Ayscue, was shot with a musket-ball and fatally wounded; with the van falling into disarray, de Ruyter attacked Albermale's squadron directly and forced him to retreat into a fog bank.   Both fleets took fairly heavy damage, but the English had the worse, with about 1,500 men killed, 1,500 or so wounded, and 1,800 captured (many of whom served in the Dutch fleet later). The Dutch lost about 1,500 killed and 1,300 wounded, but had the tactical and strategic victory.   What happened between the Anglo-Dutch wars and the Napoleonic period is a time where there was a bit of tactical indecisiveness, not to say outright cowardice, on the part of the British. The battle of Minorca is a good example -- evenly matched British and French fleets fought an indecisive battle, with 38 killed and 150 or so wounded on the British side and 45/160 on the French, after which the British held a council of war and decided to withdraw. This led to John Byng being convicted of cowardice and shot; after which British captains and admirals had a much stronger motivation to seek decisive battle.   I wrote about the battle of Quiberon Bay here before, which I'll c-p below:   > This is exactly what British admiral Sir Edward Hawke did in 1759: the bulk of his fleet lay off the northwest of Ushant, with two small ships of the line under Augustus Hervey anchored off the Black Rocks at the Iroise watching the Goulet. His ships were often blown off station, but a westerly wind usually meant that the French were bottled up in port even as the British ships were blown off blockade.  >The reason for keeping the French fleet in port was that the French, growing desperate at their losses in the Americas, had decided in 1758 upon an invasion of Britain. The invasion fleet was assembling in Vannes, in the west of France, while the battle fleet was at Brest (at the time, there were only sketchy land communications with Brest -- it relied on coastal shipping for nearly everything, and an army couldn't assemble there). The fleet would have to break out of Brest, sail to Vannes to pick up the transports, and then evade the British fleet to land troops somewhere in Britain, which was a tall order.  >The French were increasingly desperate to break out of port as 1759 drew to a close, and when a westerly gale blew Hawke off station in November, the French acted. The same day that the storm died down and Hawke left Torbay, the French left Brest. They were blown far to the west before they could come about and head for Vannes, and had trouble with the fleet because many of its men were inexperienced at sea after being bottled up in port. They sailed for Quiberon Bay, where the transports waited, with the British fleet on their heels, and made it almost there before sighting the British fleet. The French gambled that the British would not follow them into Quiberon Bay, because the British lacked charts of the area, but Hawke attacked at once and the French fleet fled. The British caught up with the tail end of the French fleet just as the van was entering the bay, and at that point the wind backed and headed the French, as well as kicking up an extremely rough sea.  >The battle was a disaster for the French; the Thesee sank attempting to open its lower gunports (the ship flooded) and the Superbe sank after two broadsides from Hawke's flagship. One French ship was captured; three were trapped in the Vilaine river with their guns thrown overboard to lighten ship; and six were wrecked or sunk. Two British ships were also driven ashore and wrecked, but their crews were rescued.  British casualties were about 400 men killed, against French of 2,500 lost in battle and/or drowned.   The best-known battles of the age of sail, of course, were Nelson's three victories at the Nile, Copenhagen, and Trafalgar. I've written about the Nile here and Trafalgar here -- casualties in both battles were quite high.   Of course, that doesn't also mean there were engagements with fewer! The famous action between *HMS Speedy* and the Spanish ship *Gamo* ended with the British losing three killed and nine wounded, in capturing a much larger ship with 14 killed and 41 wounded (more men than were on board *Speedy*).   I'm going to need to stop here for now, but I will come back later and expand!"

                "content": " This is one of those questions that is very hard to answer, but an interesting one (there are no inconsequential questions!). One window into the SF-nerd response to *Galactica*\u2019s premiere is via the magazine *Starlog* (fair warning- Archive.org has the entire print run digitized here - I\u2019m not responsible for time lost down this internet rabbit hole!). Staffed by some hardcore American SF fans and launching in the mid-1970s, *Starlog* was one of the major mainstream sources of information about SF and fantasy media. The magazine ran episode guides, interviews with cast and crew, special effects layouts, and other material not commonly available. Letters to the editor not only weighed in on the merits of various movies, but also asked such minutia like whether or not Patrick McNee did *Battlestar*\u2019s voiceover (he didn\u2019t) or what was the main unit of measurement used in the series. *Starlog*\u2019s main articles could veer into uncritical fluff. For example, one of the issues mentioned below excitedly reports that Star Wars coming to television screens soon in a holiday special complete with photos of Lumpy and the other Wookies celebrating Life Day. Nonetheless, the magazine\u2019s editors and commentators could strike an occasionally critical tone and *Battlestar* was not immune to this occasional censure.  *Starlog*\u2019s editor in chief Howard Zimmerman\u2019s column \u201cLast Word,\u201d was decidedly critical of the pilot and initial episodes in Issue 019. Zimmerman wrote:  >It\u2019s hard to decide whether my basic reaction to ABC\u2019s *Battlestar Galactica* is anger or incredulity; I guess it\u2019s equal parts of both. At the time I write this, the first six hours of the show have aired: the initial three-hour movie, a two-hour film broken into two parts, and one hour-long episode. I\u2019ve seen more than enough. The three-hour premiere suffered from script and film editing problems and an overall sense of confusion. So many lines and scenes raised my hackles that I can\u2019t go into them all.  After raising up a few plot holes, Zimmerman notes \u201cthe sad truth is that the plot inconsistencies are only part of the problem. There is no science background in the show whatsoever.\u201d He concluded his editorial by noting that while *Star Trek* started out as a \u201c*Wagon Train* to the stars,\u201d the show managed to transcend this limitation when \u201cthe role of the *science officer* was expanded [emphasis original,\u201d and its scripts explored legitimate SF concepts.   While Zimmerman\u2019s critique was harsh, he did hold up hope that *Battlestar* could live up to *Star Trek*\u2019s success. David Gerrold, one of *Star Trek*\u2019s writers, did not see much potential in *Battlestar*. In his column \u201cHope-The Human Challenge,\u201d in Issue 026 which was written after the news of *Battlestar*\u2019s cancellation broke, Gerrold noted that the reason both *Battlestar* and its British contemporary *Space:1999* failed directly reflects the reasons for *Star Trek*\u2019s enduring popularity: hope in humanity\u2019s future. Both the cancelled shows showed humanity with its back against the wall amidst a hostile universe, which he contended made these shows not  reflection of the future, but instead a reflection of the malaise of the 1970s. Gerrold contends that:  >The premise[in *Battlestar*] is even less honorable: \u201cThey\u2019re after us! Let\u2019s run like hell!\u201d Perhaps this is why *Battlestar Galactica* has been cancelled. When the viewing audience began to realize these people were not going to find a place to stand and fight back, they lost interest. Who can really care about a show that has cowardice as a part of its basic format? That one simple change, perhaps- letting these survivors find a planet and fight to defend it- might have been enough to save the show. At the very least, it would have provided a reason to care about these people. And that reason would have been called *hope* [Emphasis original].  Both Zimmerman and Gerold damned with faint praise *Battlestar*\u2019s expensive special effects (which were extensively covered in various *Starlog* issues), but warned that effects were no substitute for story, and used *Star Trek* as a benchmark example.   Of course, not all of *Starlog*\u2019s readers agreed with these critical assessments. Zimmerman \u201cLast Word,\u201d in Issue 020 remarked that \u201cMy last editorial on this space opera prompted many readers to write highly emotional letters in defense of the show.\u201dSome of the published letters took issue with Zimmerman\u2019s excessive criticism. Tom Sorlie\u2019s letter in Issue 021 argues that \u201c*Battlestar Galactica* isn\u2019t the only show with faults. All shows have faults. (Yes, even *Trek* has mistakes, trekkies!)\u201d Other letters, while not mentioning *Battlestar*, complained that *Starlog* had a clear pro-*Trek* bias that colored its coverage of new SF. Despite this defense, Zimmerman\u2019s critique of *Battlestar* struck a chord with some readers. Mark Shepherd\u2019s letter in Issue 21 attacked Glen Larson\u2019s privileging of spectacle over substance:  > .There is one fact that is glaring and certainly one of the wonders of Hollywood \u2014 the (*Galactica*) scripts. Granted Glen Larson wanted to do  the job solo, but, er, Glen, it just isn't working. How nice it would indeed be to have culled mainstream writers into this from the start. Consider: The script is the most important element in the world of visuals, and on TV it is the cheapest to come by. Low man on the totem pole is the screenwriter. The smallest part of the budget\u2026  While *Starlog*\u2019s editorial and reader letters are not a comprehensive source about fandom\u2019s response to *Battlestar Galactica*, it was one of the major SF publications of the era. Some clear *Star Trek* partisans like Zimmerman compared Larson\u2019s creation to Roddenberry\u2019s and found the former quite lacking. Not every reader of *Starlog* agreed with this negative assessment, as evidence by letters defending the show and the simple fact that *Starlog* continued to run positive articles on *Battlestar*\u2019s actors and special effects as well as advertisements for official *Battlestar* merchandise well after the show\u2019s cancellation became common knowledge. This suggests that despite their editor\u2019s misgivings about the show, the magazine\u2019s owners still believed that *Starlog*\u2019s readers still desired information about their now-cancelled show."

The program you're talking about was *The Adventures of Superman* which aired from 1940 through 1951 and was sponsored by Kellogg's Pep Cereal (that's going to be important in this story later). Keen comic book historians will note that this show began airing a mere two years after Superman's first comic book appearance in 1938 (Action Comics #1). This shows just how quickly Superman, and the whole concept of superheroes, had risen in popularity (in the wake of Superman, you had Batman, the Human Torch, Namor, and many lesser known debuts before the '30s ended). By the mid-40s, the entire nation was obsessed with superheroes and, of that group, Superman was king.     Of course, one of the biggest reasons for Superman's rapid rise of popularity (and superheroes in general) was WWII. In every iteration (comic book, newspaper strip, radio show), Superman battled Nazis and Axis powers and bolstered the morale of American boys and girls nervous about the fates of their fathers and brothers overseas. It was the perfect combination, a villain so powerful and evil it could only be met by a hero with superpowers.      And then the War ended in 1945 and the creators of these superhero stories were faced with a dilemma. Whom would the most powerful beings in the world face now that Hitler was gone?      Enter human rights activist and author Stetson Kennedy. Kennedy wanted to expose the inner workings of the Ku Klux Klan to the world and so infiltrated the Klan and recorded everything he witnessed. (It should be noted that the Klan during the '40s is considered the Second Klan, and was different from the Klan of the '60s or the Klan of the 1800s. The nation was greatly divided in their opinions about the Klan and many associated the Klan with fascism) Kennedy took all of his notes exposing illegal activity on the part of the Klan to the police, however the local police refused to do anything about it, reportedly because the Klan had infiltrated the police force.      And so you had a group of writers looking for a new villain comparable to the Nazis and an activist wanting to expose a group many saw as fascists in America. It was a match made in heaven.      \"The Clan of the Fiery Cross\" was a fifteen part series that aired in  1946. In the story, an Asian-american kid named Tommy Lee needs Superman's help as he and his family are facing opposition from a mysterious group that wears hoods and terrorizes the minority community. In the series, the writers used the information given to them by Kennedy, including code words, strategies, etc. and built a villain that was recognizable to their audience. And the audience loved it.      And the Klan did not. The Klan petitioned Kellogg's to order the writers to stop the series or drop the show all together. But the reaction of the public was so unbelievably positive, Kellogg's denied the claim. This would prove to be a fatal blow to the Second Klan. The entire organization fell apart on a national level and, from the '50s through the '60s, any Klans that rose up were local groups with no true national leadership. And when the Klan rose up, they faced a reality that America now viewed them as comic book status villains instead of the freedom fighters they had hoped to portray themselves as.      One trivia item of note, you talked about how Superman had as association with \"all-American\" values, and you probably think of the phrase \"Truth, Justice, and the American way.\" The tag on, \"The American way,\" wasn't included in the radio show and only became part of the Superman vernacular until much later.

                "content": " Great question! Unfortunately (or fortunately), it straddles different topics, eras, and historiography which makes it an adventure to answer and difficult to give you a single answer. This doesn't mean it can't be done, but in the spirit of Ask Historians, an answer about the layers of history in your question. And then an attempt at an answer.  First, there's the matter of what we can infer from children\u2019s behavior centuries ago based on what adults put down in writing and which writing endured. There\u2019s the use of your word \u201ctoddler\u201d which is a fairly modernish term (usage dates to the late 1700) that describes a human in a particular stage of development distinct from previous or subsequent stages; and this notion of distinct stages has its own history. Then there's the specificity in your question around the \u201cterrible twos\u201d which is a very short window of time in a human\u2019s life about which an adult may or may not write. (I feel comfortable saying two-year-olds medieval toddlers weren't keeping food and behavior journals.) Finally, there\u2019s how the adults around the child constructed boundaries for behaviors and how they vary in terms of what\u2019s considered an inappropriate tantrum or an appropriate expression of independence. These boundaries are shaped by a society\u2019s \u2013 be it modern or medieval \u2013 thinking about gender, disability status, race, religion, class, the nature of childhood itself, the expectation of children, and in the case of your question, dietary habits.   It's helpful to spend a bit more time thinking about one of the challenges in your question: your precision. It's a great detail, but alas, it makes it a bit harder to answer as a historian of the medieval era can probably shed some light on the eating habits of toddlers but likely won\u2019t be able to explicitly say \u201cyes, this thing happened\u201d because the adults who wrote about children wouldn\u2019t have used your level of precision.   I often experience similar tensions in American education history, I can rattle off anecdotes I've come across from teacher journals from the mid-1800s where a child is described as misbehaving (her words), but the child\u2019s age is often not noted (\u201cthe youngest Smith boy\u201d) or is described in the context of when they attended school (\u201cwinter session.\u201d) However, I also know that her journal writing is informed by the social pressure she experienced related to how well she did her job. So, it's difficult to know for sure if what she's describing as \"misbehavior\" was the sort of thing children did because they're children or truly something dangerous or harmful. And to complicate it, the same teacher might write home that the same child was an absolute hellion to her but through sheer force of will and motherly instincts, she was able to calm him down and teach him his letters. And of by the way, if the school board was interested in buying new books for the school, she knows this particular boy simply loves to read. Which is to say, she's a bit of an unreliable narrator with regards to the things children in her charge did. So, if you asked, \"have 7-year-old boys always hated school?\" I couldn't say for sure. I could tell you there are instances of teachers reporting boys around age 7 or so did not like doing the thing they asked them to do.   Although related in historiography and themes to the history of education, there is a separate branch of historians who study the history of childhood and youth. It's their work that can help us understand the imprecision regarding age I described above is not a universal trait. As an example, Berner (2014) looked at the rituals in the lives of Ashkenazic Jews in the 1700s and could describe down to particular years how children were treated because a child's age played a role in the rituals of the community. From her 2014 article: \"very young infants were often brought to the synagogue, bringing toddlers and children under the age of three or five was usually discouraged.\" So it's possible a historian of Ashkenazic Jewish childhood could speculate how two-year-olds might have responded to food they disliked, but it's difficult for us to extrapolate from one community to the broad category of human two-year-olds across an entire extended era.   Finally, there's the issue of taste. That is, this idea we wouldn't eat something - or allow a toddler to pick and choose - because of the taste or flavor has its own complicated history that I dipped my toe in and promptly turned around. Perhaps a food historian can chime in on the history of food for toddlers - but again, it would difficult for us to extrapolate from taste to behavior to patterns over time.   That said, I'm going to go out on a limb and say no. To be sure, historians can look at the historical record and reach different conclusions. It happens routinely and is, in truth, one of my favorite parts of \"doing\" history. So, it's entirely possible someone is writing another post in which they say, \"yes, and here's what leads me to that conclusion.\" I, however, am going to say no, and here's why.  It's very possible that a two-year-old in 1066, when faced when a spoon full of food, offered a very strong opinion that indicated they did not want to eat that food, thank you very much. And given what we know about universalities of human development, it's very likely they did. However, the heart of your question is how the adults responded, not what the child did. The very notion of a tantrum is a fairly modern - 20th century - concept. That is, the idea of toddler expressing their opinion strongly and vocally in response to a request for an adult deserves its own name (\"tantrum\") emerged from the idea that there is \"typical\" child behavior - or normal and abnormal behavior that needs to be redressed.   I wrote about the field of Child Study in response to the question, \"What is the history behind \"What is your favorite color?\"\" and the movement's impact can be seen in your question, and in fact, the curiosity behind your question. In effect, they asked the same thing you're asking: why do small humans do these things that big humans don't? The founder of the movement, a man named G. Stanley Hall, was fascinated by this idea that the attributes of childhood could be observed and studied in the same way scientists studied the natural world. This isn't to say adults before the Hall came along in the late 1800s weren't curious about children's motivations - or had opinions - but rather, Hall created structures that gave rise to developmental psychology, child psychiatry, and societies for Mental Hygiene focused on children's behavior.   While adults in previous eras would and could describe children's behavior on a continuum or scale in relation to their siblings or other children, what Hall and his contemporaries did was related to scale and norming. They collected thousands of anecdotes about children, detailing everything toddlers did and wrote about patterns. The field of child psychology encouraged doctors and parents to frame children's behaviors as good or bad, healthy or unhealthy. Kathleen Jones 1999 book, *Taming the troublesome child: American families, child guidance, and the limits of psychiatric authority.* goes into more detail about how this history evolved and explores how the theories behind a child's \"tantrum\" ran the gauntlet from \"their mother gave them too much attention as a baby\" to \"their mother didn't give them enough attention as a baby.\" Public health, especially child health, was a very popular social issue in the early 1900s and doctors around the warned of disastrous events if a child's bad behavior weren't fixed. Thus, tantrums became something to be handled and fixed, rather than something children did.   Which is to say, did medieval toddlers strongly and vocally express their opinions about food? Probably. Did parents see such opinions as abnormal behavior that needed to be handled? Likely not.    ________ Berner, T. (2014).

When we read about military archery, generally we only learn about archers firing mass volleys in the general direction of an enemy army.  Are there any examples from any culture of specialized military archery units tasked with taking precise aim at specific targets at long range?  I've heard plenty of stories of individual archers accomplishing such feats under various circumstances, but I'm not aware of any purpose-built precision archery forces from history.  It's possible to reliably strike human sized targets at 100 yards or more with primitive archery tackle, surely this would have come in handy from time to time, such as when a high ranking enemy came within range or a politician needed defending during a public appearance, etc.\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " The short version is no, they didn\u2019t really, at least not during the Middle Ages (I can\u2019t vouch for earlier, not my area). The medieval battlefield wasn\u2019t particularly well suited to long ranged precision archery \u2013 once everyone was in a melee there wasn\u2019t much opportunity to engage in specific targeted shooting without a huge risk of friendly fire. Archers in fact would often be armed with melee weapons of their own and might join in the fight once things got particularly intimate, leaving their shooting to either covering the advance of the army, forcing a repositioning or disadvantageous attack by enemy forces, or covering a retreating force (although retreating in good order wasn\u2019t particularly common in the Middle Ages so this was probably the rarest of all). In essence they were more of a support weapon than one suited to specific deadly killing \u2013 despite what some in the longbow-fandom might have you believe.   As for assassinations, that raises a more interesting question. I\u2019m going to limit my answer a bit by focusing on the crossbow because it\u2019s arguably the weapon better suited to this task. The crossbow was generally more accurate, much easier to aim, and had the advantage of being able to be loaded held ready while the archer lined up the perfect shot (in theory anyway). The crossbow was also used in a few famous assassinations and assassination attempts, a few of which I\u2019m going to discuss below.   Probably the most famous person ever to be killed by a crossbow is King Richard I of England. On the twenty-fifth of March 1199, King Richard I of England decided to patrol the walls of the Ch\u00e2teau de Ch\u00e2lus-Chabrol. He had been besieging the castle for some time and he may have decided that evening to inspect the progress of his sappers in their attempts to breach the castle\u2019s defences, we can\u2019t know for certain. Whatever his reason he very quickly would come to regret his decision as that evening he was shot by a crossbow wielded by one of the castle\u2019s defenders. Richard was transported back to his private tent, where the crossbow bolt was removed a process which, thanks to the dubious qualities of medieval medicine, badly mangled his arm. The wound soon became gangrenous. While the king lay dying in his camp his forces successfully completed the siege and put the defenders to the sword. Richard died on the sixth of April, just over a week after he had been initially wounded. His heart and entrails were buried in the castle\u2019s chapel and his body was transported Fontevraud Abbey in Anjou, where his father had been buried almost a decade earlier.   While King Richard has left us nothing in terms of a description of how he came to be mortally wounded the same cannot be said for contemporary historians. There are numerous accounts of the death of King Richard I \u2013 after all a king dying in a battle or siege was a fairly rare event even in the Middle Ages\u2013 from which we should be able to reconstruct the events of his death in greater detail. Unfortunately for historians, these accounts often disagree on major details and are often filled with errors \u2013 making constructing a single coherent narrative of the death of the king a difficult task. There are many interesting things to be learned from these accounts, though, and it is worth spending a time here exploring a few of the more interesting and informative ones.   Remarking on his death, the French chronicler William le Breton found a certain poetic irony to his fatal wounding by the crossbow, as he accused the vile Richard of having introduced this most sinful weapon to European warfare in the first place, making it only fitting that it be the tool to relieve Europe of his presence. This theory for the origins of the crossbow is patently false. The crossbow, along with the bow, had been banned in inter-Christian warfare at the Second Lateran Council in 1139, nearly twenty years before Richard was born. The ban obviously was not very effective, Richard\u2019s death is a pretty clear testimony to that, but the Lateran ban adds further confusion to the French chronicler\u2019s statement. It seems unlikely that he would be entirely ignorant of the decrees Council of a major papal council.   It is also interesting to note that this anecdote about Richard introducing the crossbow appears in only one of William le Breton\u2019s two accounts of Richard I\u2019s death. In William\u2019s *Gesta Philippi,* a prose chronicle about the life of King Philip II, he nearly exactly copies the version of events presented in the work of Rigord, another French chronicler who was writing a few decades before William. Rigord\u2019s account is not particularly in-depth and describes how Richard besieged the castle because he desired a recently discovered treasure \u2013 a treasure which Rigord describes as a golden figure of a Roman emperor \u2013 before he was shot and killed by an unknown crossbowmen.    It is in his *Philippidos* where William really lets his imagination run wild and the death of Richard I is a 200 line literary set piece that closes out Book V of this panegyric written to praise King Philip II of France in celebration of his victory at Bouvines in 1214. The relevant passage mentioned above comes as part of a 31-line speech delivered by one of the three Fates who has decided that while her sisters are still weaving Richard\u2019s life she feels it must end. She guides Lord Archard of Chalus \u2013 the lord of the castle and person who we are told found the treasure in the first place \u2013 to discover a hidden crossbow bolt because: \"This is how I want Richard to die, for it was he who first introduced the crossbow into France. Now let him suffer the fate he dealt out to others.\" This speech must be seen within the broader context of the work \u2013 the *Philippidos* is a work meant to praise Richard\u2019s long-time rival Philip II and as part of that work it frequently and vehemently condemns the English king in no uncertain terms. We are told that Richard I was killed because of his greed in demanding the treasure for himself despite no claim to it, and that he had no respect for God, broke treaties, and violated holy days. No crime is beneath Richard in this work, and so the suggestion that he was responsible for introducing the crossbow is just another exaggerated crime of the English king.   The English chronicler Roger of Howden wrote what is probably the most famous account of Richard\u2019s death and his confrontation with his killer. Roger of Howden was an English chronicler probably best known for accompanying Richard on the Third Crusade and providing a detailed account of the expedition. Roger tells us that Richard was outside Chalus Castle preparing for the imminent assault when he was shot by the crossbow, and upon being shot Richard rode back to camp and told the captain of his mercenaries to begin the assault without him. Roger tells us that Richard was shot by a man named Bertrannus de Gurdon and that when Richard learned that he would not survive he had Gurdon called before him \u2013 the castle having fallen by this stage and its defenders captured. We are told that Richard asked him: \"What wrong have I done to you that you should kill me?\" To which Gurdon responded: \"You killed my father and my two brothers and you wished to kill me. Take what vengeance you like. So long as you die I shall willingly suffer any torments you may devise.\" Roger says that Richard forgave Gurdon and ordered him be released, but upon the king\u2019s death the captain of his mercenaries, a man named Mercadier, had Gurdon captured and flayed alive. This narrative is probably the closest we come to having a clear assassin who was determined to specifically kill King Richard.  The historian John Gillingham has suggested there are reasons to doubt Roger\u2019s account of events, however. While Roger has generally been regarded as an impartial and reliable source, Gillingham draws a distinction between what Roger was writing in the 1170s and 1180s from his work in the 1190s. While in his younger years Roger had been intimately involved in Anglo-French politics, by the late 1190s he had retired to Howden in Yorkshire and seems to have primarily concerned himself with regional matters in and around northern England. As such, he probably is not a particularly informed source about events in central France during this period. So while we know Roger was writing very close to the event \u2013 he only outlived Richard by a few years \u2013 Gillingham suggests there is reason to interpret the Bertrannus de Gurdon story as myth."

                "content": " There is almost certainly no single origin for the trope of the grim, mysterious, or downright evil wetland. It appears in cultures across the globe, in early texts as well as more recent media. Wetlands cover about a quarter of the Earth\u2019s land area, and there are many, many types\u2014peat bogs, salt marshes, mangrove swamps, floodplains\u2026 Given this impossible-to-cover scope, I\u2019m going to point to just a few factors that may play into the negative perception of such biomes, at least for some cultures, at least some of the time. Also I\u2019m interpreting the \u201cevil and foreboding\u201d of your question pretty widely, to encompass a spectrum of weird, supernatural, and frightening associations. \r    \r   I\u2019ll cover five broad categories of spookiness associated with wetlands: disease, predators, natural dangers, the concept of the liminal, and lawlessness. This isn\u2019t meant to be comprehensive, and there's undoubtedly more to be said. Also, as you\u2019ll see, aspects of each of these qualities inform and shade into one another. \r    \r   /u/lunes8 goes into this in more detail, so just briefly: the association between wetlands and disease isn\u2019t some relic of ancient superstition. Mosquitoes still kill about 700,000 people a year, far more than any other type of animal. As this map shows, more than half of the world\u2019s land was malarial prior to the twentieth century, and this half included nearly all regions that were historically densely populated. Cholera, typhoid, and other nasty diseases are likewise linked to water supply, and so to the landscapes from which people draw their water. In premodern Eurasia, the killing power of wetlands was associated with the \u201cmiasma,\u201d the fetid vapors of decay that rise from swamps. The ancient Greeks and Chinese alike attributed numerous fatal diseases to this fog, and the belief that miasma causes epidemics was prevalent into the 19th century before finally being replaced by germ theory.    \r    \r   Moving on to somewhat larger animals, wetlands are home to a number of dangerous beasts, including crocodilians, snakes, sharks and other predatory fish. The Sundarbans, the world\u2019s largest mangrove forest on the Bay of Bengal, contains a famously deadly population of tigers. Bears, boars, hippos, and other irascible megafauna also frequent these habitats, particularly at times of year when humans may also be more likely to enter them in search of resources like salmon or mast. Alongside\u2014and perhaps at least somewhat inspired by\u2014these biological creatures are the countless monsters said to dwell in swamps, marshes, lakes, and rivers: the Stymphalian birds and Hydra of Greek myth, the Australian bunyip, the mishipeshu or \u201cunderwater panther\u201d of indigenous North/Northeastern America, the nahang of the Iranian world (whose name means something like \u201cthe one who pulls its prey beneath the surface\u201d), and the Swamp Apes and Loch Ness Monsters of modern cryptozoology, to cite just a few. Some scary water dwellers, like Peg Powler of the Tees, may play \u201cnursery bogey\u201d roles, keeping children cautious around dangerous activities (like straying too close to deep water.) Others, like Grendel, are used to express complex anxieties about culture, history, and colonization. But in various forms, their stories are told worldwide, rooting a deep connection between wetlands and uncanny, often malevolent beings.  \r    \r   Probably equally important for the imagining of these monsters are the numerous natural dangers of wetland environments. Quicksand is probably the most cinematic. Drowning remains the leading non-congenital cause of death for children 1-4, and traditional balladry is full of woeful tales of drowned lovers. Simply getting lost in the wilds is incredibly dangerous, and shifting ground, mist, lack of landmarks, and thick vegetation can all make wetlands especially easy (and treacherous) places to get lost. The power of swamps to bewilder travelers is typified by will-o\u2019-the-wisps, glowing atmospheric phenomena (probably including flares of marsh gas as well as bioluminescent animals and plants) imagined as wicked spirits leading the unwary into the mire. \r    \r   The presence of supernatural beings is in turn linked to the perception of wetlands as liminal or transitional zones. They often occur at the junctures between different biomes, and around bodies of water which have often functioned as boundary markers for human societies. Wetland topography is regularly re-shaped by flooding and other forces, and constant transformation is also perceptible in the amphibious creatures that live in these areas. These and other associations have given an explicitly otherworldly cast to wetlands in numerous cultures. Many peoples associated with the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex along and east of the Mississippi River identify the wet, gloomy, and transformational aspects of swamps with the Lower World, a realm of chaos and death as well as wealth and fecundity. In Northwestern Europe, lakes and bogs are frequently depicted as passage points between the human world and otherworldly realms. Medieval texts like *Branwen ferch Ll\u0177r* and *Tydorel* describe the terrifying consequences of human interactions with the denizens of these underwater spaces. As with the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, there was a recognition that wetlands contained great wealth for those who dared to delve into them\u2014but that these rewards were often guarded by uncanny powers. There really was literal treasure in European wetlands\u2014many Bronze and Iron Age goods have been recovered from ritual deposit sites in pools, swamps, and marshes. The occasional association of such items with bog bodies, corpses eerily mummified in peat bogs, may have further contributed to the perception of wetlands as sites inhabited by bizarre and unsettling entities.  \r    \r   And of course, as /u/ThatHapsburgMapGuy says, wetlands have always been inhabited by human societies. While I disagree with their contention that the vilification of wetlands \u201cmust be recognized as a discourse of modernity\u201d--there are few more evil swamps in literature than Grendel and his mother\u2019s lair in Beowulf\u2014I fully agree that it is, also and often, \u201ca discourse of exclusion.\u201d Following their citation of James Scott, it\u2019s reasonable to say that wetlands are up there with mountains and deserts as biomes that have historically resisted systems of state control and legibility. Border zones, difficult to map, dangerous to outsiders for all the reasons discussed above, very hard to pacify with roads and fortresses\u2014wetlands have long attracted those who seek to live outside (or on the margins of) states. People move to, or stay in, these zones for a variety of reasons: for example, holy solitude (like Saint Guthlac), banditry (as depicted in the great Chinese novel *Shuihu zhuan*, \u2018Water Margin\u2019 or \u2018Outlaws of the Marsh\u2019), freedom from taxation and conscription (as with the runaway serfs who contributed to the formation of Cossack communities along the Dnieper), or anticolonial resistance (the last native Prince of Wales, Dafydd ap Gruffydd, and the Wampanoag sachem Metacomet are only two of the many resistance leaders who made their last stands in swamps). From the perspective of central governments, these regions and their intractable communities are easy to depict as enemies of civilization, even as states covet the resources they hold.  \r    \r   All of these features feed into the fictional \u201cbad reputation\u201d of wetlands. Note, though, that especially the last two factors can have a positive valence, depending on narratorial perspective. For every foreboding swamp, there is an idyllic riverbank, Yoda\u2019s hut, or rebel stronghold. These contest the discourse of wetlands as obstacles to human flourishing, and insist instead on their ecological, social, and political importance."

There is some disagreement about whether or not the Van Lews were participants in the Underground Railroad prior to the war, but during the Civil War, she did facilitate the escape of enslaved people and Union soldiers from areas like Libby Prison using a series of safehouses that had been set up to get them North.  Because freeing slaves was \\[edit\\] ~~actually illegal~~ impractical to the point of near-impossibility \\[end edit\\] under Virginia law, she issued informal papers of manumission to enslaved people \"belonging\" to her family, and arranged for them to conduct their own affairs and control their own finances in Richmond.

                "content": " There was no average life for an average slave on an average plantation -- that's one of the reasons I really enjoyed the film *12 Years a Slave*. It shows the multiple ways that slaves existed, and the numerous strategies that slave owners adopted. One strategy was essentially a paternalist approach, epitomized in the film by Benedict Cumberbatch's character. The idea is that the slave owner won't face as much resistance from slaves if he treats them with some measure of decency, and develops a bond of some kind between slave and master. In case you're interested, this way of mediating between master and slave was famously charted by Eugene Genovese in his book *Roll, Jordan, Roll*.   The other major strategy was to inspire terror. I think that you err in assuming that these slave owners' infliction of violence on their slaves was irrational. Your comparison between them and \"Hitler/Satan\" and your example of people not beating their horses suggests this, at least to me. Rather, slave owners' violence was often quite calculated and strategic. As someone else noted in this thread, slaves were much smarter than horses. They saw that they could be beaten or killed for any act of defiance. In the antebellum South, many slave owners maintained a constant atmosphere of violence and fear, in order to keep slaves under control. Slave owners were not simply cruel for no reason. Admittedly, in the film, Epps seemed to be motivated by simple malice. Fassbender's portrayal didn't allow for much nuance. However, slave owners would have known precisely why they were attacking or beating their slaves.   A final point I'll make tonight is that if we look beyond the antebellum South, prior to the abolition of the slave trade, it was not uncommon for slave owners to beat or work their \"property\" to death, knowing that they could cheaply replace them. Admittedly, this changed to an extent after the slave trade was abolished, but I would argue that the logic was not really that much different in the mid-nineteenth century United States. Slaves were replaceable, and a slave that resisted his/her master's tyranny in any way might seem to be more trouble than he or she was worth. This logic certainly holds for other kinds of property - horses, in your example."

David Musto (the god of American narcotics historians) wrote a fascinating 1989 paper entitled \"Why did Sherlock Holmes Use Cocaine?\" that I recommend too.  Before we talk about Arthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes, let's pull back a little bit and talk about late Victorian British society's attitude toward narcotics. Narcotics \u2500 particularly opium and morphine, but also cocaine and other substances \u2500 were a hot-button topic in Victorian Britain and the United States at the time.  As Jay points out, a lot of the discussion on opium portrays it almost as a plague with significant racial undertones, given that most British and American audiences were introduced to opium by Chinese immigrants or a Chinese experience. That's remarkably ironic given the role the British played in spreading opium in China. In Britain, the Anglo-Oriental Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade circulated a journal called *Friend of China* that ostensibly tried to point out all the harm opium had done to China.  In reality, it was a spectacularly racist publication that frequently claimed that the Chinese were piteous children unable to protect themselves against the opium menace, and only Western society could save them. Moreover, the journal warned, the opium menace might spread to Western society, with Biblical allusions to Hosea 8:7 (sowing the wind and reaping the whirlwind).  You see an anti-opium mood spread rapidly into popular culture in the late 1860s and into the 1870s. Dickens' unfinished novel, *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*, for example, features an opium addict and scenes in an opium den. The notion of the opium den as a plague, as something to be feared because it might infect polite society, begins to come to pass at this time. Conan Doyle takes it up, as does Oscar Wilde in *Picture of Dorian Gray.*  Meredith Conti, in a paper published last year in the book *Victorian Medicine and Popular Culture*, wonderfully explains that chronic drug use combined with this infectious, xenophobic viewpoint, and hit popular culture with a splash.  >\"Soon, however, a number of factors gradually reshaped public attitudes toward drug addiction: the return of wounded soldiers addicted to analgesics; physician over-prescription; the surge in opiate-laced patent medicines ... the invention of the hypodermic needle; and the first legislative restrictions on non-medical opiate use.\"  In popular society, there had been a belief during the middle part of the century that addicts had nothing to blame but themselves. It was because of their weak will, or poor morals, or some personal factor that made them vulnerable to opium, alcohol and vice. As Darwin's theories became more popular, the idea came about that there must be a genetic cause \u2500 that addicts have a hereditary inclination toward addiction.    Note that there is at this time a big difference between *addiction* and *use.* This distinction would persist until the early 20th century, by and large. You'll frequently run into references to the idea that high-performing individuals, fast thinkers, big-doers, need to use narcotics to moderate their overheating minds, otherwise they might suffer a breakdown. You see this in *The Sign of Four,* where Conan Doyle writes about Holmes needing to stave off boredom.  Elsewhere, there's often a feminine tone to this language, as the thoughts of the period were that the feminine spirit was fragile and needed to be kept in balance or otherwise preserved from too much emotion.  The idea of a \"naturally corrupt\" class of people prone to addiction starts to change in the late 1870s and early 1880s. In 1876, Edward Levinstein published the influential *Morbid Craving for Morphia*, which described narcotics' *corrupting* influence, about how even proper people could be brought low. In the years after his work, drug addiction became a medical condition in Britain.  At the same time, cocaine begins to come onto the British scene in a big way. In 1885, for example, Doyle's hometown of Southsea hosts the British Dental Association's annual conference. The conference's big topic? The virtues of cocaine anaesthesia. This was also the time when Americans, British citizens and others in Western society were flocking to coca-laced beverages (*Coca-Cola,* anyone?) as the new fad.   In a 1994 paper, \"Sherlock Holmes, Conan Doyle and cocaine,\" D.N. Pearce suggests that Doyle's studies at the University of Edinburgh, where toxicology research was quite advanced for the time, gave him a leg up in anticipating the harmful effects of cocaine.  By the time *The Sign of the Four* is published five years later, with its remarkable references to cocaine addiction, the popular mood had begun to shift in the direction of cocaine as a vice rather than a pure medicine. The Sherlock Holmes stories aren't the only place you see this discussion come up. Think of *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, published in 1886, and other stories, such as those by Bloomsbury and M.P. Shiel.  Jay suggests that Conan Doyle intended Holmes' cocaine habit to be part of his bohemian, counterculture identity, but as popular opinion began viewing cocaine as purely a vice, references fade to holmes' use. By 1904, when *The Missing Three-Quarter* is published, Conan Doyle writes that his hero has been \"weaned\" from his \"drug mania\" which had \"threatened to check his remarkable career,\" something that's clearly a ret-con to accommodate changing times.  As Musto wrote in his 1989 paper, \"Therefore, Holmes's use of cocaine was not reprehensible. Leading physicians much more prominent than the wise Dr. Watson recommended cocaine for the reasons Holmes used it. That he used cocaine was unfortunate, but he corrected the error \u2500 and that was commendable.\""

This is the place to apply for a flair \u2013 the colored text you will have seen next to some user's names indicating their specialization. We are always looking for new flaired users, and if you think you have what it takes to join the panel of historians, you're in the right place!  For examples of previous applications, and our current panel of historians, you can find the previous application thread here, and there is a list of active flaired users](/r/AskHistorians/wiki/flairedusers) on our wiki.  **[Requirements for a flair**  A flair in /r/AskHistorians indicates extensive, in-depth knowledge about an area of history *and* a proven track record of providing great answers in the subreddit. In applying for a flair, you are claiming to have:  * **Expertise in an area of history**, typically from either degree-level academic experience or an equivalent amount of self-study. For more exploration of this, check out this thread.  * The ability to **cite sources** from specialist literature for any claims you make within your area.  * The ability to provide **high quality answers** in the subreddit in accordance with our rules.    For a more in-depth look at how applications are analyzed, consult this helpful guide on our wiki explaining what an answer that demonstrates the above looks like.  **How to apply**  To apply for a flair, simply post in this thread. Your post needs to include:  * Links to **3 to 5 answers** which show a sustained involvement in the community, including at least one within the past month.    * These answers should **all relate to the topic area in which you are seeking flair**. They should demonstrate your claim to **knowledge and expertise** on that topic, as well as your ability to write about that topic **comprehensively and in-depth**. Outside credentials or works can provide secondary support, *but cannot replace these requirements*.  * The **text of your flair** and which category it belongs in (see the sidebar). Be as specific as possible as we prefer flair to reflect the exact area of your expertise as near as possible, but be aware there is a limit of 64 characters.  * If you are a former, now inactive flair, an application with **one** recent flair-quality answer, plus additional evidence of renewed community involvement, is required.  One of the moderators will then either confirm your flair or, if the application doesn't adequately show you meet the requirements, explain what's missing. If you get rejected, don't despair! We're happy to give you advice and pointers on how to improve your portfolio for a future application. Plenty of panelists weren't approved the first time.  If there's a backlog this may take a few days but we will try to get around to everyone as quickly as possible.  **Updated Procedures**  Note that we have made some slight changes to the requirements of the past. Previous applications required all answers to be within the past six months. But we realize that this can sometimes be tough if you write about uncommon topics. We have changed the temporal requirement to be *one* answer that was written in the past month. The answers as a whole will be evaluated holistically with an eye towards a regular pace of contributions. i.e. 3 answers each spaced 3 months apart would be accepted now, but we would likely ask for more recent contributions if an application was one recent answer and the rest over a year old. Flair reflects not only expertise, but involvement in the AskHistorians community.  **\"I'm an Expert About Something But Never Have a Chance to Write About It!\"**  Some topics only come up once in a blue moon, but that doesn't mean you can't still get flair in it! There are a number of avenues to follow, many of which are dealt with in greater detail at the last section of this thread.  **Expected Behavior**  We invest a large amount of trust in the flaired members of /r/askhistorians, as they represent the subreddit when answering questions, participating in AMAs, and even in their participation across reddit as a whole. As such, we do take into account an applicant's user history reddit-wide when reviewing an application, and will reject applicants whose post history demonstrate bigotry, racism, or sexism. Such behavior is not tolerated in /r/askhistorians, and we do not tolerate it from our panelists in any capacity. We additionally reserve the right to revoke flair based on evidence of such behavior after the application process has been completed. /r/AskHistorians is a safe space for everyone, and those attitudes have no place here.  **Quality Contributors**  If you see an unflaired user consistently giving excellent answers, they can be nominated for a \"Quality Contributor\" flair. Just message the mods their username and some example comments which you believe meet the above criteria.  **FAQ Finder**   To apply for FAQ finder, we require demonstration of a consistent history of community involvement and linking to previous responses and the FAQ. We expect to see potential FAQ Finders be discerning in what they link to, ensuring that it is to threads which represent the current standards of the subreddit, and they do so in a polite and courteous manner, both to the 'Asker', and also by including a username ping of the original 'Answerer'.  **Revoking Flair**  Having a flair brings with it a greater expectation to abide by the subreddit's rules and maintain the high standard of discussion we all like to see here. The mods will revoke the flair of anybody who continually breaks the rules, fails to meet the standard for answers in their area of expertise, or violates the above mentioned expectations. Happily, we almost never have to do this.  **Additional Resources**  Before applying for flair, we encourage you to check out these resources to help you with the application process:  * Our Rules Roundtable on what a 'Good Answer' looks like * Our Wiki Guide on what makes a good application * The Previous Application Threads, to see what makes for successful - and not successful - applications.  * The Sunday Digest, and Monthly Awards which can provide many examples of we are looking for regarding the caliber of flaired users.\n\nAssistant:"

As the incidence of the virus has subsided in certain geographic areas, employers have begun to reopen their worksites and have required employees to return to their physical place of work. In doing so, these employers have been met with requests from certain employees that they be permitted to continue working remotely, leading to the question of whether the employer is required to grant such a request. In Technical Assistance Questions and Answers issued on September 8, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) answered the question with a qualified \u201cNO.\u201d  Physical presence at the work site is considered an \u201cessential function\u201d of many jobs, which, in some cases, was excused by employers during the pandemic. The EEOC\u2019s Technical Assistance document states clearly that even if  an employer is permitting telework to employees because of COVID-19 and is choosing to excuse an employee from performing one or more essential functions, then a request\u2014after the workplace reopens\u2014to continue telework as a reasonable accommodation does not have to be granted if it requires continuing to excuse the employee from performing an essential function. The ADA [(Americans with Disabilities Act)] never requires an employer to eliminate an essential function as an accommodation for an individual with a disability.  According to the EEOC, the temporary suspension of performance of an essential function of the job during the pandemic \u201cdoes not mean that the employer permanently changed a job\u2019s essential functions, that telework is always a feasible accommodation, or that it does not pose an undue hardship.\u201d  While it appears clear that employers are permitted to reinstitute the requirement that employees return to the worksite, the EEOC\u2019s Technical Assistance does not suggest that all requests for continued telework can be summarily denied. Not surprisingly, the EEOC states that, while an employer is not restrained from restoring all of the employee\u2019s essential functions when it restores a prior work arrangement, it must still \u201cevaluat[e] any requests for continued or new accommodations [including telework] under the usual ADA rules.\u201d The text of the EEOC\u2019s Technical Assistance relating to continued teleworking can be read at section D.15 in the \u201cReasonable Accommodation\u201d section of [What You Should Know About COVID-19 and the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and Other EEO Laws.  We are not surprised that the EEOC has taken this position on continued teleworking. Employers can expect employees to return to the worksite upon request but must engage in the \u201cinteractive process\u201d when faced with a disability-related request for an accommodation and must be prepared to articulate a business rationale for making physical presence at work an \u201dessential function,\u201d especially when the employee was permitted to work remotely during the pandemic.

Last Sunday after I finished with a client a member of my team who we will call Sabrina started going around to all of my other teammates whispering something to them. I started to feel uncomfortable because I really felt like she was gossiping about me and I am not a confrontational person. I called my manager and let him know I wasn\u2019t feeling well so I left.  Yesterday I worked with Sabrina, she didn\u2019t speak to me but I was busy with appointments throughout my day anyway so I didn\u2019t interact with many coworkers.  Today I come into work and Sabrina was standing in a circle what looked to me like gossiping. Someone walked into the store I work at and I know him personally from outside of work so I said hi to him. Sabrina went up to him and asked if he needed help. Shortly after i asked him how he has been and how long he would be in town for. I let him know he has my number if he needs anything.  I walked away and Sabrina said didn\u2019t you just see me greet him? I said yeah I know but I personally know him. Another coworker who seemed to have been gossiping said \u201cyou say that every time it\u2019s disgusting.\u201d The other two coworkers she was standing around refuse to talk to me ever since Sunday. Nobody ever told me what I did wrong. I\u2019m assuming I sold a lot and left early so they were annoyed by that. However I did leave because the gossiping was making me so anxious I couldn\u2019t work.   Sabrina kept throwing jabs at me throughout the day. At the end of the day I had a client come in, he had an exchange. He was in the fitting room trying it on and came out to show his friends and ask for their opinion. Sabrina was standing next to me the whole time because she was helping the friends. I don\u2019t believe she realized that this client was doing an exchange that I had originally sold him. So when I told him it looks nice and he should get that one she muttered \u201cyou\u2019re going to learn today\u201d.  I walked away and called my supervisor and let him know of everything that was going on. He had witnessed her complaining about me earlier. I told him what has been happening with the team and how she\u2019s behaving. I have never gone to management over a coworker.   TLDR; Sabrina used to be a work friend, we\u2019re both the same age and attractive women. I relate more to the customers I think and clients do seem to gravitate toward me. Where she kind of walks around, stares in the mirrors and talks to associates all day.   Two weeks ago she screamed at me for trying to \u201ctake her customer\u201d (he wasn\u2019t being helped and was walking around trying to find anyone to assist him) she pointed her finger in my face and wouldn\u2019t stop yelling. I had to tell her to leave me alone 3 times.   She apologized the day after, I accepted and said please don\u2019t talk to me like that again.   Why is she behaving like this? Half of my team seems to hate me now but nobody has said why! I asked another coworker who is always very neutral and he said \u201cI know they\u2019ve been talking about you, it makes me uncomfortable and I stay out of that and I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s happening to you, I really don\u2019t understand why.\u201d  I let the management team know what is going on because I don\u2019t get involved in drama, I\u2019m easy to talk to as well. My manager sent me the Human Resources hotline and told me to call them to keep everything documented.   I just wish I knew why they are ganging up on me and I need to know how to move forward. Any advice would be so helpful.  *any said names have been changed for privacy concerns\n\nAssistant:"

[CA] I'm torn over whether or not I'm overreacting to an incident with a coworker, and whether going to HR is the right decision.  Backstory: I started at a company a little while ago, and LOVE my new job. My tasks often require me to be alone with my supervisor or the coworker who is training me (in areas like storage rooms, empty offices, etc.). I'm significantly younger (25) and physically smaller than them, and the only woman, but I've never felt uncomfortable\u2014 until this week.  **The other day, I asked the coworker who is training me (mid-fifties, married with kids) an innocuous question about a work procedure. The moment the only other person present left the (enclosed, windowless) room, he straight-up interrupted me and said, \"Just between you and me...and  I hope you don't take this offensively, but... I think you're** ***hot***.\"  Past experience has made me scared of angering men who hit on me, so I just said \"thank you\", made a joke (I don't see myself as attractive, but I didn't want to encourage more compliments by saying it), and laughed it off. **He seemed to think I was happy he told me and made jokes about how happy I must be that he \"finally said it\" (?????).** After half an hour of pretending to go through emails while I had tremendous anxiety, I went to lunch and cried.  I've started wearing baggy cardigans over my work shirts to hide my body a little more, and timing certain tasks for when he's present so I can have a moment of peace. I find myself not volunteering for things as much in case he offers to join me. When he wants to show me something, I find myself trying to get it over with as soon as possible so we're no longer alone. **I'm just unbearably anxious and uncomfortable.**  **My job depends on his training and his feedback to our boss and I'm worried that if I tell him off, it'll not only make the workplace** ***more*** **uncomfortable, but also inspire him to retaliate by telling our boss I didn't do things adequately, etc.**  I've made an appointment to speak with someone from HR, but now that the appointment is made, I'm doubting myself. I'm not asking for action to be taken, but I want a record in case another incident like this occurs. **Am I overreacting by going to HR, or is this something an HR rep would want an employee to speak to them about?**\n\nAssistant:"

This freed up the young Greeks mind to pursue more esoteric activities such as thinking about why things are or are not.  Many Greeks, instead of needing to pursue apprenticeship in a labor intensive trade were free to join one of many literal schools of thought. Plato, Aristotle, the stoics, the epicureans, the pathagorians etc... established brick and mortar schools of thinking sometimes occupying the same city squares as other prominent schools. Bertrand Russel writes in his history of western philosophy of how Greeks were often free to choose a school of their liking and simply attend, often free of charge.  He even describes schools who were in close proximity to each other would have their pupils and teachers standing in the streets shouting at young passers by reasons to joint their school and not the one across the street in an attempt to recruit young Greeks unburdened with a trade into their circles."

Peter Kropotkin writes in \"Anarchist Morality\"  >\\W\\]e are persuaded that the great majority of mankind, in proportion to their degree of enlightenment and the completeness with which they free themselves from existing fetters will behave and act always in a direction useful to society  Emma Goldman takes a somewhat similar view that in a successful revolution, a cultural shift will occur (she uses Nietzsche's term \"the transvaluation of values\") that that would keep people from coopting a revolution to gain power. She specifically writes about this in the context of the Russian Revolution where the Bolsheviks came to dominate a revolution that could've been more anarchist in nature, because the revolution lacked a social revolution that brought about the fundamental transvaluation of values that is necessary to create a free society.  However, to answer your actual question, some anarchists assert that anarchist societies are better equipped to deal with those that might take power than non-anarchist societies. [Colin Ward takes this view in \"Anarchism as a Theory of Organization\"*,* where he discusses how \"in small face-to-face groups, the bureaucratising and hierarchical tendencies inherent in organisations have least opportunity to develop\". Todd May and Murray Bookchin take similar, if not identical, views where federalism/decentralization exists as a tactic against megalomaniacs because there is no set path to power, and especially no path to enough power that one could so completely come to dominate large swaths of land/populations through conquest."

The vast majority of content on the internet is free because it serves to attract readers to those sites.  I am very skeptical about the idea that one might be able to (with a clear conscience) browse to and consume content into which someone else has put time and effort, while actively denying them any compensation for said effort.

But there are poorly designed concert venues and bad seats in plays, and neither of these seem to give me the moral justification to break in and consume the content for free.

If capitalism is your ethical framework, I suppose that could be it. As an aside: Is capitalism your ethical framework? If so, it might be super important to reflect on what that really means for you and what types of atrocities are committed under the rubric of capitalism as it is utilized by politicians and states rather than philosophers. But... to follow up, why should an exchange only be monetary? Truly very little content that is valuable goes viral without payment for it to be seen somewhere (i.e. facebook/twitter dumping ads directly into your feed and making it appear as if it was posted by your friends). It'd probably be more realistic (and true to what even google believes the internet to be) that SHARING content you enjoy through relevant web 2.0 channels is a much more impactful thing for a website attempting to monetize through various channels than anything else (for the uninitiated, feel free to check out link juice, pagerank, reasonable surfer, or the other endless ways that algorithms are able to understand strength/value/trustworthiness of various websites).   Beyond that, pretty much anything creating value is going to require a user to click on the ad and not to just view the ad. Sometimes these even require conversions into users or paid accounts. Payments for viewing ads went out of style quite a long time ago, though they still occupy a small subset of the market.   In a slightly different vein, is it unethical to find a competitor's keyword they've paid for on google and ask all of your friends to click on that link? In the world of pure competition and capitalism, attempting to bankrupt or disrupt your competition is not unethical. It's just merely a subset of tactics. While google refers to this as \"black hat,\" let's not play that google is some type of ethical bastion. But, what if you do it to get the website you like $$? Is it equally unethical to turn off *adblock once each month and just click the shit out of their ads? I'm sure the advertisers wouldn't appreciate that.  And my last thing before I walk away - businesses are setting up beacons all over the place to \"tag\" your phone with all sorts of ads. So, you walk through a door (or within 100 meters of a door) to a business and open up facebook and BOOM - their ad is at the top of facebook. Same goes for literally any app on your phone, tablet, laptop, etc. Is it fair that you can be geotargeted based on your location and that they can track your every click/movement/etc. through their cookies that are occupying your phone? Maybe instead they should be required to pay you for viewing the advertisements and for the information that you are likely unknowingly providing them to better improve their ad targeting and revenues, or even for the miniscule amount of space they take up on your device. If you don't think your behavior being tracked isn't the number one reason why their business intelligence creates so many positive outcomes for them, then I suggest you start by reading about your market value instead of pondering over whether making rich companies richer makes you feel unethical (weird question since the power dynamic is wholly different) or you feel sorry for a company because they suck at monetizing their website (why should you be blamed for tactical mistakes of company leaders?).  edited:adblock* was \"reddit ads\" but should have been \"adblock\""

On the other hand, Copleston's history has only a short a section on Islamic philosophy, so you may have a point.  However, people working on medieval philosophy tend to be acquainted with Islamic thought, especially Avicenna, Averroes, and Al-Ghazali, who are generally recognized as eminent philosophers of the medieval period.  Medieval philosophy is generally underrepresented in general philosophical education.  It's true that philosophers who aren't working on medieval philosophy, or on the history of philosophy broadly, likely do not have anything to say about Averroes or Avicenna.  However, they're likely not to have anything to say about Bonaventure, Eriugena, Grosseteste, Roger Bacon, Ficino, or other eminent figures in Latin philosophy from this period either.  It's only Augustine, Anselm, and Aquinas that are particularly widely known, and even they are rarely read when we compare them to the dominant figures of early modern philosophy.  So a great part of what's going on here is the general neglect, or one might prefer to say disinterest, in medieval philosophy among philosophers not working in the area.  It's natural that, with minimal general interest in medieval thought, it is Augustine, Anselm, and Aquinas who are most widely known, as it is these figures who exercise the most manifest influence on modern philosophy, so that people whose engagement with the history of philosophy is principally through the conventions and reports of modern philosophers will tend to have passing familiarity with these three figures, rather than with someone like Averroes or Avicenna, even though the latter are eminent figures from the standpoint of medieval philosophy itself.  Of course, part of the context here is the European background of modern philosophy, so that it's interests naturally fall on those figures who contribute most directly to the religious, scientific, and political concerns of Europe.  And this would naturally lead to prioritizing the Catholic philosophers of the medieval period over the Islamic ones."

And when we ask something like \"what is knowledge?\", it is presumed that by \"knowledge\" we are talking about the object which we perceive through the faculty that is at work whenever we use the word \"knowledge.\" And so in *that* sense, we are asking a question about our own usage of the word.  But classical metaphysicians will say that our usage of words is not just an arbitrary convention; rather, they reflect some real perceptual faculty we have of some real thing, and that's what we're supposed to be investigating.  For these people, the kind of solution they're expecting to \"what is knowledge\" is like the scientific answer to the question \"what is red?\" Once we've discovered that redness is a wavelength of light, now we've identified the object which we are (imperfectly) perceiving and reacting to when we naturally apply the word \"red.\" And one might think this secures color a firm, mind-independent metaphysical footing: red is not just an arbitrary label we apply to certain objects and not others; rather, it is a specific range of produced light wavelengths. (All this is controversial in the philosophy of color, and in fact I think what I just described is a fringe view. But I'm just giving an example of what kind of thing we imagine we might be looking for when we ask \"What is this thing?\")  &#x200B;  An opposing view is that we don't, or shouldn't, want that kind of solution. They will generally demonstrate that we don't want that kind of solution by asking if we'd be satisfied with finding one, and then trying to convince us we wouldn't be. And they'd say: if you *don't* want a solution like *that*, then you can only be talking about the conventional use of terms.  But the \"conventional use of terms\" can be more fundamental that you might realize. Indeed, what constitutes \"fundamentality\" or \"importance\" might themselves be matters of convention -- so the conventional use of terms might be as important as importance itself!  The thing to recognize *here* is that often what looks like just a semantic quibble *really* is a dispute about normative outcomes. If it doesn't look like science, perhaps that's because it's ethics. For example: \"Is this person the same person?\" often informs our intuitions about what to hold them responsible for, what to feel like we owe them, and so on. I made a promise to you yesterday; do I still owe you that promise today? *Should I still* honor that promise? These are normative questions, and they're all downstream of the question \"Is this person the same person\" -- making that question perhaps fundamentally an *ethical* question. Here, maybe, it's clearer to you how different answers would make a difference."

One way that people try to separate the two is that persuasion, as such, involves at its end an act of judgment whereas manipulation, as such, aims at either somehow thwarting or subverting the act of judgment.   (Burke *Rhetoric of Motives* and Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca *New Rhetoric* - Parker's \"Rhetoric, Ethics and Manipulation\" would be helpful here.)   This is one the places where the idea of Discourse Ethics and the Ideal Speech Situation is born - that when we find ourselves in the space of reasons we're distinctly in a space where people are meant to be giving and taking reasons to be submitted equally to the judgment of everyone else around.  For people who see communication this way (ex: Habermas), this is where the legitimacy of deliberative democracy is ultimately grounded - in deliberative procedures which end in a certain kind of judgment.  In an important way, these ideas are super old and are extensions of the ideas of Isocrates as we might find in, for instance, *Antidosis*.  There are two sorts of moves against this way of seeing things:  1. The move by the classical Sophists to say that, no, it's basically manipulation all the way down - or something like it.  Like, this judgment stuff is a very nice story but, sorry, it's tricks all the way down.  Gorgias makes a version of this argument in \"The Encomium of Helen,\" and it's part of this idea we see played out in Plato that sophistic rhetoric is a kind of drug - a *pharmakon*, just like the one later developed by Derrida concerning writing. 2. The move by feminist scholars to say that, even worse, that this rational narrative about persuasion is just not so and that we need to think differently about how we use language in these contexts and, instead, aim not to persuade but to do something like \"invite.\"  Foss & Griffin's \"Beyond Persuasion: A Proposal for an Invitational Rhetoric\" is one of the early texts about this.  Anyway, basically any of the major treatises on rhetoric from basically whenever try to treat this topic in one way or another."

I found his views quite fascinating thought you might as well:  \"*During the Christmas holidays of 1949 I decided to spend my spare time reading Karl Marx to try to understand the appeal of communism for many people. For the first time I carefully scrutinized 'Das Kapital' and 'The Communist Manifesto'. I also read some interpretive works on the thinking of Marx and Lenin. In reading such Communist writings I drew certain conclusions that have remained with me as convictions to this day.*  *First, I rejected their materialistic interpretation of history. Communism, avowedly secularistic and materialistic, has no place for God. This I could never accept, for as a Christian I believe that there is a creative personal power in this universe who is the ground and essence of all reality - a power that cannot be explained in materialistic terms. History is ultimately guided by spirit, not matter.*  *Second, I strongly disagreed with communism's ethical relativism. Since for the Community there is no divine government, no absolute moral order, there are no fixed, immutable principles; consequently almost anything - force, violence, murder, lying - is a justifiable means to the \"millenial\" end. This type of relativism was abhorrent to me. Constructive ends can never give absolute moral justification to destructive means, because in the final analysis the end is preexistent in the means.*  *Third, I opposed communism's political totalitarianism. In communism the individual ends up in subjection to the state. True, the Marxist would argue that the state is an \"interim\" reality which is to be eliminated when the classless society emerges; but the state is the end while it lasts, and man only a means to that end. And if any man's so-called rights or liberties stand in the way of that end, they are simply swept aside. His liberties of expression, his freedom to vote, his freedom to listen to what news he likes or to choose his books are all restricted. Man becomes hardly more, in communism, than a depersonalized cog in the turning wheel of the state.*  *This deprecation of individual freedom was objectionable to me. I am convinced now, as I was then, that man is an end because he is a child of God. Man is not made for the state; the state is made for man. To deprive man of freedom is to relegate him to the status of a thing, rather than elevate him to the status of a person. Man must never be treated as a means to the end of the state, but always as an end within himself.*  *Yet, in spite of the fact that my response to communism was an is negative, and I consider it basically evil, there were points at which I found it challenging. With all of its false assumptions and evil methods, communism grew as a protest against the hardships of the underprivileged. Communism in theory emphasized a classless society, and a concern for social justice, though the world knows from sad experience that in practice it created new classes and a new lexicon of injustice. The Christian ought always to be challenged by any protest against unfair treatment of the poor.*  *I also sought systematic answers to Marx's critique of modern bourgeois culture. He presented capitalism as essentially a struggle between the owners of the productive resources and the workers, whom Marx regarded as the real producers. Marx interpreted economic forces as the dialectical process by which society moved from feudalism through capitalism to socialism, with the primary mechanism of this historical movement being the struggle between economic classes whose interests were irreconcilable. Obviously this theory left out the numerous and significant complexities - political, economic, moral, religious, and psychological - which played a vital role in shaping the constellation of institutions and ideas known today as Western civilization. Moreover, it was dated in the sense that the capitalism Marx wrote about bore only a partial resemblance to the capitalism we know in this country.*   *But in spite of the shortcomings of his analysis, Marx had raised some basic questions. I was deeply concerned from my early teen days about the gulf between superfluous wealth and abject poverty, and my reading of Marx made me ever more conscious of this gulf. Although modern American capitalism had greatly reduced the gap through social reforms, there was still need for a better distribution of wealth. Moreover, Marx had revealed the danger of the profit motive as the sole basis of an economic system: capitalism is always in danger of inspiring men to be more concerned about making a living than making life. We are prone to judge success by the index of our salaries or the size of our automobiles, rather than by the quality of our service and relationship to humanity. Thus capitalism can lead to a practical materialism that is as pernicious as the materialism taught by communism.\"*"

Teaching at a community college is different from teaching at Harvard or Yale.  I teach at a midsize, private liberal arts uni in the US. I teach 3 classes per semester with 25ish students per section. My typical day involves prepping for teaching (anywhere from 30 minutes to 2.5 hours, depending on the material), teaching, research (usually 1-2 hours if I'm lucky), responding to emails, grading, and committee work.  I'd say I work 8-9 hours a day and a 4 hours on the weekend if needed.   For classes, I teach 2 sections of critical thinking and one section of an upper division course that fulfills uni curriculum requirements.  I think I'm probably pretty average for workload. Some folks get tenure and then do next to nothing. Others work 60-80 hours a week. Work-life balance is a real struggle for many academics.   Salary depends on where you live and work. Mine is good. I can afford to buy a house and occasionally take a vacation. But you won't be making 6-figures at most places until after at least a decade or two, if at all. You definitely don't go into this job for the money.  I'm very lucky. I like my colleagues (most days) and my students (most days). I get to do research on interesting issues and talk with fascinating people.   But let me say that many aren't as lucky as I am. The philosophy job market is brutal. 300 people applied for my job 7 or 8 years ago, all of them with PhDs, teaching experience, and publications. Many people spend 7 to 10 years getting a PhD and then maybe a few more in temporary positions only to realize they'll never get a permanent job. I advise undergraduates to find another way to indulge their love of philosophy without getting a PhD or going into academia. So ask yourself: what do you love about philosophy? Could you be happy majoring in it and then maybe teaching high school with a few units on philosophy? Of course you're in high school and there's no need to figure out your life plan right now, but the more you know, etc.  Make no mistake: I think philosophy is intrinsically valuable. But I don't think folks need to get an advanced degree in it to reap the benefits."

I just finished listening to Peterson on the JRE podcast and thought it was definitely the most interesting one I've listened to.   But let me give a quick disclaimer: I'm young and a beginner in philosophy and still in the midst of forming a lot of my fundamental ideas. I was a deep rational-minded atheist and Harrisite for the longest time before I experienced an \"awakening\" of some sort, which was kind of a slap in the face to my believed skepticism at the time. I won't go into detail, but it was some sort of thought-synchronization between my SO and myself, in which we seemed to share the exact same thought, same perspective, same mind. The closest thing I've found to an explanation is Carl Jung's synchronicity, as it really was some sort of death-and-rebirth experience for both us.    Reason I've explained this is to demonstrate where my mind is at now, which is an attitude of true skepticism. Everything I thought I knew and believed about my identity and the nature of reality has collapsed, and I've been left with a clean slate in my search for truth. This has led me to all kinds of different philosophers, such as Alan Watts and Joseph Campbell, as well as various eastern philosophies like Taoism and Zen Buddhism.   But let me be clear: My ideas are not fixed. While my worldview has certainly been expanded by these people and beliefs, they're more like notions I entertain without attaching my sense of self, if that makes sense.   This has now led me to a public figure who is growing in popularity: Jordan Peterson. I agreed with a lot of his opinions on the post-modern SJW movement and it was a breath of fresh air for me, being surrounded by a very leftist environment (not political either because I don't know enough about political theory/philosophy to take a stance). But what really stuck out to me is his analysis on archetypes.   In the JRE, he explains how he's religious despite being a scientist, and his explanation is that science tells us how things work and what they are, but religious fundamentals tell us how we should live, a map of morality if you will. This really stood out to me, because it emphasized some idea I've had for a while: that all these different religions and philosophies share the same core themes. He then goes into archetypes and how the reason so many fictional stories share these archetypal themes, like two brothers fighting (Good/Evil, God/Lucifer) or Harry Potter confronting the basilisk underneath the castle (facing your deep-rooted fears) is our collective unconscious manifesting itself into imaginative fiction. This was an incredibly interesting perspective to me, had to rewind it multiple times to really absorb what he was saying.   Then I go on the r/badphilosophy subreddit and search his name and I found nothing but negative criticism, which was a bit surprising to me. I started delving into the reasons why, as I'm always eager to gain the other side's perspective, and was disappointed to find that while many dismissed him, few actually explained WHY they felt he was wrong. The closest I've found to explaining this criticism is his stance on Marxism and the post-modern left taking over. I do not know enough about Marxism to have an opinion yet, but I'm still eager to know what rebuttals to his spiritual stance could be. Thank you in advance!\n\nAssistant:"

Ironically, it seems to me, that Peterson's popularity is a consequence of the internet right's ignorance of conservativism's intellectual pedagree, seeking to fill the void with whoever presents the most impressive justification for their prejudices.   After that, Peterson's psychology is as interesting as it was before his sudden stardom among transphobics and the 'alt-right.' There are interesting ideas there, mostly borrowed from past thinkers like Campell's comparative mythology, Aristotle's teleology, William James' pragmatism, phenomenology, and others, so that his audience is understandably impressed upon encountering these views for the first time.

This is because its outermost shell (if we assume its volume actually occupies the entire space) would have to move faster than the speed of light in order to produce the amount of energy/momentum that we measure.

To answer that, we can calculate a quantity called spin angular momentum (basically the rotational analogue to linear momentum) in two ways.   1) In quantum mechanics, when you have a particle of spin s, its total spin angular momentum is:  J = hbar \\* sqrt(s\\*(s+1)), where hbar = 1.05 \\* 10\\^-34 J\\*s\\^-1 is the reduced Planck's constant. For an electron, s = 1/2, so we get J = 9.1\\*10\\^-35 J\\*s  2) Now, in classical rotational mechanics, we can approximate an electron as a solid sphere of mass m = 9.1\\*10\\^-31 kg and a radius (which is called the classical charge radius of an electron) r = 2.85\\*10\\^-15 m, then its angular momentum when we have rotational velocity at the equator v:  J = 2/5 m\\*r\\*v  Equating the two angular momenta, we can calculate: v = 8.77\\*10\\^10 m/s or about 292\\*c!   But of course, we only get this result if we are using classical mechanics, which is obviously not valid in our case, as matter cannot move faster or at speed of light -> we need to use special relativity.  That calculation becomes a bit more complicated,  but it's possible to prove, that a largest angular momentum a spinning spherical body of mass m and radius r can have is equal to J\\_lim = 3/4\\*m\\*c\\*r. For an electron of classical charge radius: J\\_lim = 5.8\\*10\\^-37 J\\*s, which is more than 100x smaller than the angular momentum we would need to explain electron's spin. Therefore, modeling electrons as rotating spheres doesn't really work well at all."

I'm pretty new to physics in general, and a while ago I came across the concept of action in the context of a classical harmonic oscillator. The book I was reading said that the area enclosed by the elliptical trajectory of a 1D oscillator in phase space is equal to the action of the system. It turned out to be too high level, so I didn't read much beyond this.  More recently I learned that action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian, kinetic energy (T) - potential energy (U), with respect to time. I thought it might help clarify things\\* if I could relate this definition to the area enclosed by the phase space trajectory, as that's easy to visualise for a 1D system.  To do this I tried taking the standard equation of an ellipse, then integrating \\1/(2m) p^(2) \\- k/2 x^(2)\\] with respect to dt. I did this by multiplying the integrand by m/p and then integrating with respect to dx (as m/p = 1/v = dt/dx). I assumed that if I evaluated the integral between x=0 and x=a for positive p then this would be equal to 1/4 of the total action for one oscillation, as (in this case) T - U doesn't depend on the direction of motion nor the sign of x. So I was expecting to get (\u03c0/4)\\*ab, i.e. 1/4 of the area of the ellipse, but in fact I got zero.  As I said I'm new to all this so it's entirely possible I just screwed up the integration. But the longer I think about it, the more I feel like even in that case, I'm missing something more fundamental too. For one thing, T - U is positive along some parts of the trajectory and negative along others, and it's hard to reconcile that with the idea that it's equal to the area. But more importantly, the area enclosed by the ellipse seems to be equal to the product of the *total* energy of the system and its period, which is surely equal to the integral of T **+** U with respect to time. As U is non-zero, clearly T + U and T - U can't be the same.  So... what gives? Have I totally misunderstood and done a nonsense calculation somewhere? Are there two different quantities that can be calculated for the same system, both called action?? The [wikipedia article#Action_of_a_generalized_coordinate) does mention integrating around a closed path in phase space, but unfortunately I don't know enough to really understand what it's saying there. I couldn't find much else on the internet to help, or at least nothing written at a level I can follow.  This has been driving me up the wall for days so if anyone can put me out of my misery I will be extremely grateful!

You first need to calculate the trajectory of the oscillator in phase space.  You do this by extremising the action (finding the minimum or maximum) which reduces to solving the Euler-Lagrange equations, which in this case reduces to solving Newton's second law. You then get functions for momentum and position in terms of time, which can be treated as a set of parametric equations for a curve in phase space.  This statement is then saying that the value of this extremised action is equal to the area inside the ellipse (or circle in normalised units) in phase space defined by this curve.  As for what an action *is*: I find it most helpful to think of it as an extension of energy to trajectories. Energy is something a particle has, action is something trajectories have. In some way, it accounts for the 'cost' of the path taken, rather than just the speed of the motion (e.g., a longer path is more costly than a shorter path, even though the particle may have the same energy at every point along it). This is obviously just heuristic though. It's an abstract quantity and the best way to get a feel for it is to do some practice calculations. Key point is that it belongs to trajectories not objects."

First, the one we currently use: the EHT, or \"Event Horizon Telescope\", uses a technique called \"long baseline interferometry\" to combine radio signals from telescopes around the globe. This combined signal lets the scientists in the project \"take a picture of a black hole\", which was released last year! https://eventhorizontelescope.org/  The second approach that would work very well for space based clusters of telescopes is the idea being LISA, which works differently that what you're thinking, but is still really cool. Rather than looking for electromagnetic waves (light, radio, etc), this fleet of three telescopes would use lasers between them to measure the timing of the literal change in spacetime due to gravitational waves! These three craft would be in orbit around the sun millions of miles from one another, so certainly meets your ideas of a \"telescope the size of the Earth\". While the mission itself is still in the planning stages, the technique is known to work and a demonstration mission has been flown. https://www.lisamission.org/  For some really interesting descriptions and analysis of these projects, I'd encourage you to pick up a copy of \"Once you start asking\" by Marcus Voelter. He runs a podcast called Omega Tau, where he's interviewed scientists and engineers from these and many other \"megaprojects\".  http://omegataupodcast.net/once-you-start-asking/  The last one I'd point out is the idea of using the sun itself as a gravitational lense. This requires a telescope beyond Pluto's orbit, but is within the realm of \"plausible\" and meets your solar system sized idea for a telescope. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOCAL_(spacecraft)"

Her thoughts on core graduate courses also don't reflect what is common practice at most universities:  1. Classical mechanics is typically taught at the graduate level because you approach it from a much more rigorous standpoint than the undergraduate level. Despite taking undergraduate classical mechanics and then TAing it, I still learned a *ton* in graduate classical mechanics. Actually, it was one of the hardest classes in my core curriculum. 2. General relativity and quantum field theory are typically taught as electives, not core requirements. If you do gravitational physics, large-scale astrophysics or astronomy, or (theoretical) particle physics, you should take a semester (or two) of GR. If you're doing condensed matter theory (maybe some experimentalists) or any kind of particle physics, you should take QFT. People doing quantum gravity/cosmology or certain kinds of AMO physics should also take QFT. For everyone else, neither GR nor QFT will be very helpful in the slightest.  I also have some changes (or alternative options, if you prefer) I would make to her books.  1. I realize this is an unpopular opinion, but I think Griffiths' quantum mechanics textbook is very poor. I don't find most of the problems useful (deriving the 7th Legendre polynomial by hand using the Rodrigues formula is *not* a helpful exercise), I think his explanations are insufficient, and I think he uses a backwards presentation. I recommend any textbook that starts by presenting quantum mechanics algebraically rather than analytically. 2. Hassani's *Mathematical Physics* is a bit terse, but it's a nearly exhaustive reference on anything you could ever need for graduate mathematical methods. Some supplements from Stakgold or another text on operator theory and distributions may be helpful. 3. I strongly recommend Landau and Lifshitz's *Classical Theory of Fields* as a supplement to Jackson for graduate E&M. Starting with electrodynamics from the perspective of a relativistic field theory is an absolute joy and makes Jackson much more tolerable. 4. Gould and Tobochnik is a good supplement for undergraduate thermal physics."

The asterisk points to another book which probably has a proof. In practice people are expected to just keep reading, but that is deeply unsatisfying.

If you studied physics in a university setting, you'd start from first principles and rigorously develop the rest, *proving* all those mysterious equations mathematically, or at least justifying them from observations.  You'd have a chance to perform many of those observations yourself, rather than trusting someone else.  And the subjects would be presented in a specific order: you wouldn't have to take electromagnetism for granted while studying quantum mechanics, because the parts of E&M you need would be presented first.    However, this rigorous process is slow, and many people don't have the patience for it.  My students have the opposite complaint as you: rather than being annoyed at taking equations on faith, they're annoyed at spending so much time on mathematical proofs, and not enough time on fun applications.  To gain an undergraduate physics major's understanding of quantum mechanics, there are no shortcuts.  You'll need to read, and work problems from, full textbooks on the following subjects:  Single-variable calculus  Introductory physics (mechanics)  Multivariable calculus  Classical mechanics  Electricity and magnetism  Linear algebra  This is literally thousands of pages of reading and hundreds of hours of solving homework problems.  And you can't skip the problems: they're how you know that you *actually* understand what you read.  It takes most students about two years of study to get to this point, but it may take you less time since you have some prior experience, and an adult's time management skills.  Taking classes from a local university, or at least looking at a university physics department's course structure and textbook choices, can make a huge difference.  Finally, this post isn't meant to be gatekeeping: every academic subject sits on a tower of previous knowledge, and quantum mechanics sits on an especially tall tower.  The only way to understand what's supporting it is to climb the whole tower yourself."

There is a significant amount shared at the undergraduate level, but physics generally starts from the assumption that there is a reasonable solution.  In math, a lot of time and effort is spent determining what characteristics imply other things. In a general topology course or a real analysis course, a lot of time is spent uncovering the most general properties that imply certain facts. In calculus you use the Extreme Value Theorem, Intermediate Value Theorem, and a few other theorems that are based on continuity. Using this realm as an example, physic course often state such theorems and use them to make precise mathematical statements about the world. Math courses (those focused on unapplied math) will focus more on what needs to be true about the underlying number system in order for those theorems to hold true.  While many mathematicians do work that is meant to be applied to the real world, one of the goals in math is to make statements that are not necessarily tied to assumptions about the physical world. Because of that, a lot of effort is spent defining \"mathematical objects\" very carefully and investigating the relationships between them.  For what it's worth, ODE courses are usually taught as applied math courses. They don't have to be taught that way, but since they are so important to biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering, they often are.  I think it's worth your time to take a few math courses to get a flavor, but most decent physics texts/classes will cover the important information. Sean Carrol's GR book has excellent sections introducing modern differential geometry. I took a math differential geometry course (which I loved) that never even got to Riemannian geometry because there is so much that can be covered before reaching that. It spent a significant amount of time on topological definitions and \"simple\" theorems in 2 dimensions. You can understand a lot of GR without knowing the mathematicians definition of simply connected which relies on the definition of homotopy... which relies on the definition of homeomorphism (I double checked and it doesn't necessarily rely in it, but that is how it was taught in my topology course, so I'm leaving the slightly untrue statement in here)."

Anaxagoras proposed that the sun's glow came from its intense heat, like a red-hot stone (which is mostly correct) and that the moon reflected the sun's glow (correct), that solar eclipses were caused by the moon moving between the Earth and the sun (correct) and that lunar eclipses were caused by the Earth moving between the moon and the sun (correct). The big thing he got wrong was that he thought the sun actually *was* a red-hot stone (instead of a white-hot ball of mostly hydrogen).  Anaxagoras' ideas were new enough to be *highly controversial* among Athenians, who imprisoned him in 450 BCE for teaching that the moon reflected sunlight, as well as for teaching that the sun was a hot physical object itself and not a god (as was the accepted Athenian belief at that time.) Later Greek thinkers would expand on (or independently discover) Anaxagoras' teachings, including Aristarchos of Samos who developed the first (known) heliocentric model, and also understood that the moon reflected the sun's light.  But I bring up the severe response to Anaxogoras' \"moon reflection\" idea as evidence that he was not simply repeating ideas he'd received from earlier Athenians whose writings have been lost to time. Anaxagoras' \"moon reflecting sunlight\" idea was seen as new and dangerous to the Athenians of his day.  EDIT: What Leonardo figured out in 1510 was not that the moon reflects light *at all*, but rather that the moon also reflects light *from Earth*. When the moon is in, say, its crescent phase, the dark part of the moon isn't 100% black...there's still a very faint glow. Leonardo figured out that sunlight could reflect off the Earth to the \"dark\" parts of the moon and then be reflected back to us again as \"earthshine\"."

It wasn't so much an event as it was part of an ongoing process that's always happening. We think that (basically) all the contents just keep breaking up, migrating around to the other side of the earth, smashing together to make a supercontinent, and then they brake up again and repeat the process.  We're still in that cycle now, the mid-Atlantic rift is constantly spreading the Americas and Europe/Africa farther apart. Meanwhile, the pacific is basically being eaten by Asia and the western coast of the Americas (this is why the \"ring of fire\" exists around the edge of the pacific). New York and London are centimetres farther apart from each other every year.   500 million years before Pangea existed there was an earlier supercontinent called Rodinia (and more before that). Hundreds of million of years in the future there will probably be another super content with China squished up against the Americas. The Atlantic will be a superocean!  The process is super slow - \"geological time\" - and, as others have said, nothing alive would notice except for maybe experiencing the occasional tectonically-related natural disaster (earthquakes, fisher eruptions). It wouldn't be like the continent splitting apart with a big crack. Garben and Half-Garben would form, the land would kind of slowly spread and sink (again, not on a time scale that living things would notice). Sediment would build up in the garbens and eventually the sea would encroach in the rift valleys (or, if inland, large lakes would form). The tectonic plates would truly split up, bit by bit, fissures would occur, and over time a mid ocean spreading ridge would develop (like the one in the middle of the atlantic).   The edges of tectonic plates aren't even all one long crack like you might imagine, they are actually kind of a bunch of little cracks connected by transform faults. It's all got to do with the geometry of the world being round. Even along the spreading centers, you would never see the \"crack\" itself, because loose sediment falls down and would cover it, like you can see in this picture. The most exciting thing that you would see at spreading centers would be hydrothermal vents and maybe some volcanic or fissure eruptions.   The East African Rift Valley is an active rift zone. East Africa is basically being ripped off (the African Plate is splitting in two, becoming the Somali Plate and the Nubian Plate). At some point in the future (in millions of years) the sea will start to fill in that valley. This is whole process is called the Wilson Cycle.   Iceland is (I think) the only place on earth where land sits directly over an active spreading center, they occasionally have fissure eruptions. Basically, volcanic eruptions that happen in a long line, a crack. They would probably be the most obvious sign of spreading that could be observed in a life time. But these are TINNY little eruptions compared to the size and thickness of a tectonic plate, little brakes caused by huge tectonic forces, little bursts of stress release along the area of the spreading center.  I should say that tectonics is actually pretty new, the theory was only accepted in the 60s. Why tectonic pates do what they do and just how they do it is something that geologists are still learning about.  Edits: So many for words and stuff, and for Iceland. Thanks for the gold!"

This technique of bringing the two exposed surfaces of tissues together so that they heal naturally is called *apposition*. I think you might be interested also in wound healing.  What happens is that collagen, a long, fibrous protein in the extracellular matrix, gets laid down and then converted from type III collagen (a loose, first-response collagen) to type I collagen (a stronger collagen in scar tissue).  Wound healing occurs only in the presence of adequate oxygenation, blood supply, and lack of a foreign body/infection.  If you were talking about putting both of the cut fingers together, then they will not heal and get stuck together, because they don't have a blood supply. Instead, they will probably develop necrosis and rot away. Coagulation from the left over blood may cause them to stuck together, but it will be a loose connection based on fibrin, not collagen.  If you were talking about cutting the fingers and putting them back into the stumps, then they will heal as long as the blood supply is not disrupted and as long as there is no infection.  Edit: I imagined cutting the fingers in a cross-section, but if you were talking about cutting down the length of your finger, then they would be stuck together."

From an evolutionary perspective, a disease gets no more \"points\" for infecting humans than it would any other species. The \"primary host\" for a disease is one which is crucial for its reproduction, and there are plenty of mammalian species in which rabies is not an immediate death sentence, including those who coexist with it without any symptoms at all.   The primary carriers or rabies in the USA are bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes; all of whom are primary hosts for rabies that *aren't* killed off by the disease. Rabies, apart from the dead-end human hosts, is actually an incredibly successful and adaptable disease, that can infect (and spread) via both warm-and cold-blooded hosts, and has been even artificially spread to avian subjects as well (who aren't killed by it but do remain infected/symptomatic).

Energy (stored as ATP) is used to release those actin and myosin bonds, and they reattach further down stream to get ready to contract again.  If those active sites were to remain bonded to each other, or otherwise get stuck, it could theoretically cause a buildup on tension or \"knot\".  Enough knotting could form a 'trigger point' (which might not be a real term, not everyone agrees), or an area of such high tension there is minimal blood flow.  Lack of blood flow would cause hypoxia and other sorts of restriction that is likely to be interpreted by the brain as tenderness and pain with palpation.  Keep in mind that might be the wrong explanation, but is the model that makes the most sense based on what I've read or been taught."

                "content": " I'd like to apologize in advance, as it's been a long, *long* time since I've played the first Max Payne, so my recollection may be off. That said, there's quite a few elements to cover here, so let's get started!  >He's just a cop.  He *was* just a cop, a detective, up until his then-rudimentary training and work experience was put to the test during the home invasion that had tragically claimed the lives of his wife and child. Had a group with a little more cohesion and clarity of mind been sent in to clean up, we'd be closing the record book with the entire Payne family in body bags.  But, we didn't, because Payne walked out of that house alive and breathing, his life taken without actually having died.  On that day, Max stopped being *\"just a cop\"* and took up an offer from close friend and co-worker Alex, who got Max into a pretty tough undercover investigative program. That doesn't just require training to survive the bunch of sharks he'd be calling colleagues, it required Max to learn from those very same thugs and lowlifes, which is actually a pretty diverse range of histories and experiences. It's not common, but one of such histories is that of ex-soldiers, the sort who have survived not only whatever third world country they'd been shipped off to, but also the streets of the urban jungle, where making a mistake can have horrific results. No doubt one or two criminals Max had to affiliate with while undercover, would insist that he be a bit smarter about how he handles himself in a fight.  He wasn't at the same level as the Aesir Contractors by then, but he was pretty darn close.  Things really began to lean in Max's favor when the bank robbery at the subway station got Max's cover blown. Suddenly he found himself using what he'd learned from both worlds to gun down people he'd been watching *Lord's and Ladies* with not but a few hours ago, giving him a chance to cement everything he'd learned against a population that would be challenging but not beyond his level. The lessons of who knows how many ex-military on top of what he'd learned to become an undercover element, gave him a much needed edge to survive the events throughout, with each notch on the scoreboard being a little more experience on top of what he already knew.  It wouldn't be just criminals either. With corporate hands in the mix and government ties, Max would end up facing some pretty serious hombres, with his then-biggest rival Punchinello being little more than a corporate puppet with serious Gusto. But worse, a chunk of these guys were also something more, a growing population of persons with poor impulse control hopped up on an experimental drug that would become known on the streets only as Valkyr. These people saw themselves as fearless gods, capable of charging through gunfire if even for only a second, instilling terror enough that when the Punchinello family was out of the picture, the police soon found their positions besieged so fiercely that even trained SWAT teams were overrun.  There wasn't any logic behind the thoughts of those driven by Valkyr, just blind rage and a drive to kill. For the SWAT teams and anyone else caught in the swirl of a power vacuum that was the fall of the Punchinello family, it was a brand new and horrific rash of violence that nobody could be prepared for. For Max? It was a numbed experience, as the shock of seeing Valkyr at work had worn off long ago when he'd learned of the stuff during his undercover involvement with Punchinello and his lot, who were one of the main suppliers of the substance.   >He's just a cop.  He **was** just a cop, but as he began moving and killing the lower tier trash mobs that were average criminals and former \"business\" acquaintances, a lot of folks forget that he wasn't the *only* cop, or the *only* person impacted by his actions. When the bank robbery failed, Punchinello was in a bit of trouble; a potential source of possibly much needed revenue possibly promised to supposedly really bad suppliers had just landed in the lap of the police, and a *lot* of dead bodies with ties to Punchinello had also been recovered at the scene. Worse, it was a two-bit undercover cop that busted the whole thing.  Punchinello was in over his head, and the Russians were already nipping at his sensitive spots. By this point Max had not just given every other criminal entity in the city a *massive* amount of momentum against Punchinello's organization, Punchinello's attempts to resecure power began to crumble with the death of Lupino and numerous other lieutenants, and outright failed when Punchinello got a visit from Payne himself.  Punchinello had obligations, supply lines of guns, drugs, and Valkyr that he needed to ensure the safety of, and Max's disruptions meant *all* of those were at risk, so to preemptively counter any pushes from he Russians and other smaller players on the city, he diverted manpower to fight off any opportunistic pushes, which meant keeping his own self surrounded by whatever he had left.  As we know, his delusions were more than enough to convince him that was all he needed, when he absolutely needed more.  >He's just a cop.  When word got out that Punchinello was dead and his assets up for grabs, the city practically *exploded* with violence. On top of an already bad snow storm, the police were fighting a losing battle as every thug in the street began fighting for a piece of the drug empire pie.  But they weren't the only ones.  A few calls from sources inside the police department were more than enough for Aesir to realize that their largest trafficker of Valkyr had just been stopped dead. Not knowing the full extent of who was responsible or why they'd done it, Aesir sent instructions to their connections in local law enforcement, only to be told that anyone who could carry out those instructions were busy fighting a losing battle in the streets or already dead.  When you've got cell phones and ledgers with Aesir names on them lying in the crumbling remains of an impending FBI investigation in the middle of the biggest crisis to hit national television in years, being told *\"We can't help\"* doesn't sound like a good answer. So Aesir sent their own, some private security types to clean up what they could find and get the Aesir name far and away from the chaos that was unfolding, only to never hear from said contractors again. It wasn't that they were being found and killed by Max, so much as they just couldn't get to the evidence alive or in time.

If we leave IQ behind and just talk about \"intelligence\" then we're getting into a huge can of worms wherein we have to define what exactly we mean by intelligence.  Psychologists who work in studying it use intelligence as an ability to learn, or as creativity, or as acquisition of knowledge, or as capacity for change...  Throw brain plasticity on top of it all and things like 'potential' start to lose meaning.   (For a quick summary of some of the theories, see here; http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/p/intelligence.htm    For a quick rundown on plasticity, this article serves its purpose; http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/redefining-stress/200807/brain-plasticity-in-action-getting-smarter-and-happier)  Are you starting to see the difficulty here?

The brain is incredibly complex and its ability to adapt is not really drawing from a pool of resources (although there was a study I read about how willpower tends to be spent from a limited pool, but not intelligence. http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/willpower.aspx for a basic rundown.)

I'll go ahead and highlight probably the more relevant points for you. His definition:   >I reserve the term racism (racial ideology) for the segment of the ideological structure of a social system that crystallizes racial notions and stereotypes. Racism provides the rationalizations for social, political, and economic interactions between the races . Depending on the particular character of a racialized social system and on the struggles of the subordinated races, racial ideology may be developed highly (as in apartheid), or loosely (as in slavery), and its content can be expressed in overt or covert terms.   > Although racism or racial ideology originates in race relations, it acquires relative autonomy in the social system and performs practical functions.)9 In Gilroy's words, racial ideology \"mediates the world of agents and the structures which are created by their social praxis.\" Racism crystallizes the changing \"dogma\" on which actors in the social system operate, and becomes \"common sense;\" it provides the rules for perceiving and dealing with the \"other\" in a racialized society. In the United States, for instance, because racial notions about what Blacks and Whites are or ought to be pervade their encounters, Whites still have difficulty in dealing with Black bankers, lawyers, professors, and doctors. Thus, although racist ideology is ultimately false, it fulfills a practical role in racialized societies  (I cut out internal citations, btw). So, this definition is largely structural, and that's pretty much how most social scientists study race in the modern era. He explains what he believes are the different aspects of this structure as well:  > First, racialized social systems are societies that allocate differential economic, political, social, and even psychological rewards to groups along racial lines; lines that are socially constructed. After a society becomes racialized, a set of social relations and practices based on racial distinctions develops at all societal levels. I designate the aggregate of those relations and practices as the racial structure of a society.   > Second, races historically are constituted according to the process of racialization; they become the effect of relations of opposition between racialized groups at all levels of a social formation.   > Third, on the basis of this structure, there develops a racial ideology (what analysts have coded as racism). This ideology is not simply a \"superstructural\" phenomenon (a mere reflection of the racialized system), but becomes the organizational map that guides actions of racial actors in society. It becomes as real as the racial relations it organizes.   > Fourth, most struggles in a racialized social system contain a racial component, but sometimes they acquire and/or exhibit a distinct racial character. Racial contestation is the logical outcome of a society with a racial hierarchy. A social formation that includes some form of racialization will always exhibit some form of racial contestation.   > Finally, the process of racial contestation reveals the different objective interests of the races in a racialized system.   What this comes down to is that the simple psychological definition of racism is rather limiting and somewhat denies the historical and societal context of race. Race and perceptions of race - stereotypes, prejudices, or otherwise - are learned as well as reinforced by societal structures. This applies not just to whites, but to members of all race groups.  Omi and Winant's work on Racial Formations is probably also really helpful in understanding how race is understood academically."

Then, you map out correlations (for example - female education and infant mortality rates, although that is a much simpler example than one this data is used for) and, based off past records, you estimate the impact that changes in a given demographic will have.

This being a popular topic, you can find a lot more spread around other threads in this subreddit, for which I would suggest hunting.  ---  (I am aware you are also interested in sexism.

A more direct question would necessarily revolve around the nature of capitalism. Can the logic of capital accumulation provide the basis for a sustainable world? As we have seen throughout modern history, capital seeks out new markets, transforming previously unmarketable goods into commodities. This includes many things, from health services, to ideas, to water, to complex financial instruments. In other words, there is an expansion of 'places' (markets) in which commodities can be bought and sold, places where 'things' are transformed into commodities that can be privately and exclusively owned, either by individuals or fictitious individuals, such as the corporation. In this process, capital (as a set of social relations) seeks to 'privatize' or commoditize everything and anything so as to produce more capital. There are setbacks to be sure\u2014the welfare state is a good example\u2014based on political and economic conditions, the balance of class power, and other factors, but on the whole the trajectory is toward more and more capital accumulation, and thus, greater centralization of capital in what we now call transnational corporations.  Given the general nature of this logic, the trajectory is toward a fairly dystopian world where everything (and I mean everything) is bought and sold, subject to market forces. This is, of course, a hypothetical situation in which contingency plays no part\u2014and as we know, historical events are nothing if not incredibly contingent, and in some cases, contradictory to our understanding of development.   By itself, the nature and logic of capital accumulation seems unsustainable in the long run without destroying the planet and pushing the majority of the world's subordinate classes into further poverty, with less control of their political economic futures. Of course, that in itself is unsustainable, and thus, as we move from crisis to crisis we see different popular reactions and counter-movements (e.g., the Quebec student strike, Occupy, etc.). So while capital accumulation is likely unsustainable, I do not think it is impossible to have a world in which 'economic growth' is sustainable, but this would need to be an economic growth based not merely on profit for individuals\u2014fictitious or otherwise\u2014but rather, those who create social wealth in the first place.  That is my personal view on the matter, but in answer to your question of why governments are obsessed with 'growth' you could take a number of different approaches. Using a Foucauldian lens, you might ask where our fascination for 'growth' came from, examining texts and archives, etc., to determine the genealogy of the concept (more so, in the sense of what Foucault might call a particular governmentality of growth).  You could also take a Marxian-influenced perspective that examines the role of the state. The state (and government) cannot be viewed as independent actors. They are explicitly tied to the economic system, and, as such, are themselves a relation of production that makes possible the appearance of a separation between the political and economic system. Therefore, you might want to examine the particular 'economic'\u2014not to be taken as a separate entity\u2014conditions that has framed the nature of 'growth' in particular eras. Are they different? Why or why not? Is it merely a case of what I outline above, based on the nature of capital accumulation? Or, are there other factors that have influenced the nature of growth, its trajectory and development? What about political ideologies such as neoliberalism which takes a somewhat different approach to growth than the policies of the Keynesian Welfare State?  That's just a start, but hopefully it helps."

(Download link for the full pdf. is included in the article below.)  https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/nation/fbi-white-supremacists-in-law-enforcement  There have been tons of studies done showing that police across the country have a strong pro-white and anti-poc bias. Google and you'll find dozens. Here's a few I pulled up in less than 5min:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/nation/fbi-white-supremacists-in-law-enforcement  https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.citizen-times.com/amp/2208040002  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/city/city-police-data-again-show-more-african-americans-stopped-without/article_e670ef32-3192-11e9-b7c6-675db3c2f609.amp.html  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-0103-african-americans-marijuana-arrests-20190102-story,amp.html  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/identities/2018/5/14/17353040/racial-disparity-marijuana-arrests-new-york-city-nypd  https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/a-new-look-at-racial-disparities-in-police-use-of-deadly-force-98681  So, statistically police are more likely to arrest black folks for basically everything, and much more likely to use deadly force against them. (There are similarly high statistics for other groups such as indigenous Americans, Hispanic and latinx Americans, etc.)  I imagine it would be hard to compare if they are more biased than the general population by these numbers because they have more power than the general population to act on bias. I'm not sure how that would be measured, though political affiliation is easy enough.  Police are much more likely to consider officer shootings of black folks to be \"isolated incidents\" compared to the general population, which is more likely to see them as indicative of a larger problem.   https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/01/11/police-views-public-views/  According to this study police seargents, sheriffs, state troopers, and detectives are more right leaning, while police officers are split down the middle and police chiefs are very slightly left leaning.   A different study on how occupation relates to political affiliation in the US showed that most careers where the split was pretty even were not moderate, but very polarized. That may be the case with law enforcement as well, but hard to tell as this study didn't separate law enforcement and the previous study didn't show that much detail. (Although both were taken from campaign contributions.)  https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/findings/  Another relevant find is that police officers are three times more likely to physically abuse their children compared to the general population:  http://womenandpolicing.com/violencefs.asp  I wasn't able to cover everything, but this should give you a good starting point for further research."

                "content": " Harvard professor Jim Sidanius and Co. have done some good research on this--not just in terms of the racial/gender outcome of Blacks in the US, but for out-group (read: racial minority) men in multiple industrialized countries. This is what lead to their Social Dominance Theory.  Essentially **The worst outcomes in a society will generally be held by outgroup men--out-grouped usually in terms of their race--as opposed to outgroup women.** The combination of outgroup male's maleness and minority status makes the in-group perceive them as more of a threat than their female counterparts, leading to more discrimination in job hiring, the criminal justice system, education, risk of homelessness, child mortality, etc.  This is in contrast with the popular \"Double Jeopardy\" theory, which holds that minority women have to bear the burden of both racism and sexism, while their male counterparts have the \"privilege\" of only having to deal with the former. The empirical, survey, and archival evidence used by Sidanius and co. shows that in actuality, the Womanhood of minority women in many ways *prevents* them from receiving as much discrimination and poorer outcomes as their male counterparts.  For example, black women are sentenced more leniently than even white men--and at about the same as white women. As I'm sure we all know, black men aren't so lucky.  In the famous 2005 Bertrand and Mullainthan study \"Are Emily and Greg more employable than Lakisha and Jamal?\" which studied labor market discrimination, it was found that applications with white-sounding names were much more likely to receive a callback than those with black-sounding ones. Not really surprising. What was interesting, was that applications with Black *female* sounding names had a significantly higher callback rate than equally-credentialed applications with Black *male* names. For whatever reason, *Lakisha was seen as being more employable than Jamal, even though Jamal should have supposedly had an advantage over her because of his maleness.* I guess you could just look at this discrepancy in terms of filling diversity quotas: Lakisha checks off two boxes, Jamal only checks off one.  Evidence like this supports one of the implications of Social Dominace theory, which is that *intersectionality is not additive*, meaning that you can't just assign a positive or negative value to a set of group classifications (+1 for white, male, heterosexual, etc.; -1 for non-white, female, non-hetero, etc.) and whoever ends up with the highest score is the most privileged in any situation, and the lowest is the least. Although black males would \"score higher\" than black females in this system, the real-world data doesn't reflect this.   TL;DR: Minority males will be both the primary perpetrators and victims of arbitrary-set discrimination (the arbitrary set being their race/ethnicity). Minority men will be treated like minority men; minority women will mostly be treated like...women. If things improve for women, things will improve for minority women. It's a whole different story for minority males.   Sidanius did a short lecture going through all this a few years ago prior to his death. I'd highly recommend that you watch all of it to understand the underlying framework of the theory--and look into his work in more depth--but the discrepancies that you asked about are addressed starting at 21:49. It shows that additional education is rewarded much more in the job market for minority women than it is for men, and other things related to income.  Hope this helps."

They suggest that, in one year, the potential direct cost savings just from obstetrical or delivery costs was about $981,000. Additional direct cost savings might come from prenatal care, which they estimate could range from a $2.50 to $7 cost savings for each dollar invested in the program. They also mention that, since average birth costs were used, they may not reflect the additional costs that would be incurred by women undergoing Caesarean sections or caring for babies of low birthweight; costs in these cases are exponentially higher than in normal births, so cost savings would be commensurately higher.   The authors also mention a good study by Hoffman (2006) who found that early teen births reduce the lifetime earnings of the resulting children by about $810 per year, or about $35,000 over the course of a lifetime.   It's important to note that the sample size for this study is VERY small. Their data examine dependent minors, and the number of eligible women was obtained from the PEIA (Public Employees Insurance Agency); it's unclear whether the numbers are for all minor dependents in the state or just minor dependents covered by the PEIA itself. They also assumed a participation rate of 20% (that is, 20% of eligible dependent minors actually took contraception). Either way, their assumption was a sample size of 2,625. So these numbers reflect a VERY small sample population compared to a larger geographical area or a higher participation rate, and are probably conservative even for this small sample size.   Whether these numbers are directly applicable to a larger population is a bit unclear; for example, as they point out, costs vary widely depending on the ease of the birth, and the age of the parent is directly correlated with this (for example, minors are more likely to have babies of low birthweight, with commensurately high costs as mentioned above). However, most likely they're at least in the ballpark. At the very base of all this is the fact that contraception coverage is extremely cheap for insurers (dollars per person), whereas covering the birth, prenatal and post-natal care of a child costs in the thousands of dollars. The economics on that end is fairly simple."

You see it a lot with pizza. Someone will say, \"ugh, dominos? Haven't you had *real* New York pizza/Italian pizza/Chicago pizza?\"  This argument is weird, and it incorrectly assumes 2 things:  1) That dominos is desperately trying to re-create authentic NY/Italian/Chicago pizza (and failing).  and  2) Because of this, dominos is now awful and can't be enjoyed.   Thing is, dominos isn't *trying* to be authentic. It's just trying to sell a different kind of food completely. But, because Italians Pizza and Dominos pizza are both called \"pizza,\" people flip out. If dominos were just called \"Tomato and Cheese bread,\" less people would probably experience this phenomenon.  And, it isn't just pizza.  You can love Dogfish Head IPA and still appreciate that budweiser maybe has it's place (as something completely different). You can be a film connoisseur and still appreciate that Michael Bay films are mindless summer blockbusters (and being a mindless summer blockbuster doesn't somehow offend other films).   And again, you can love amazing New York/Chicago/Italian pizza, and still know that dominos is something else completely, and still has it's own merits.  Me? I live in Taiwan and eat (IMHO) the best Chinese food in the world. When I go back to the states, I eat Panda Express. It's delicious. I don't sit around going, \"wow, I had sesame chicken in Hong Kong and... ugggghh this is *sooooooo* wrong.\" Panda Express isn't trying to be HK -- Panda Express is trying to sell delicious cheap food from a trough. I imagine if Panda Express just called itself \"Jimmy's Fried Chicken Bits w/ Rice\" or something, people wouldn't whine about how \"inauthentic\" is it.  People automatically assume that inauthentic things are worse, when in reality, the shift was usually hugely intentional (and doesn't necessarily say anything about the quality of said product).  To me, this is a logical fallacy. Has it ever been labelled or named?\n\nAssistant:"

Bourideu writes about it in Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste (wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinction:_A_Social_Critique_of_the_Judgment_of_Taste).  Basically he argues certain preferences of taste are also ways of establishing oneself as being from a certain social class and not from another.

So if you buy into the understanding of history and you consider states and agriculture good things then maybe there's a benefit. It's not a direct benefit from inequality. Rather inequality is an emergent feature of the institutional norms and rules of these kinds of societies.   When we look at contemporary evidence generally speaking hunter gather societies and horticultural societies don't have large inequalities. What's interesting is looking at hunter gather societies that do have large inequalities, such as the St'at'imc or agricultural societies that don't have large inequalities such as the (post-great Law of Peace / pre Beaver Wars) Haudenosaunee (see Graeber's Debt for a possible explanation for this). What are the institutional differences? It's also interesting to reverse the question and consider in a state agriculture society what institutional forms would result in lower levels of inequality (hint: they have high levels of redistribution)? Samuel Bowles (cited above) makes the argument that internet culture and open source has many resemblances to hunter gather social organisation.

It would appear to me that the UK doesn't necessarily need armed police officers because of generally low rates of crime, esp. homicide at 1.2/100k in 2012 (vs. Canada at 1.6 and US at 4.6) **[1] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate)**. Of these homicides, few are committed with a gun, with the UK coming in a 0.04/100K (vs. Canada 0.5, and US at 10.3) **[2] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate)**. So there may not be a perception of a lot of guns causing problems that would require guns to combat them.  Further, another factor would probably be how often police feel outgunned. In the UK there were only 3 police officers killed by firearms in England and Wales in the span between 2000 and 2011 **[3] (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/116483/hosb0212.pdf)**. Compare this to the US where in 2012 alone, 43 law enforcement officers were killed with a firearm **[4] (http://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2012-preliminary-statistics-for-law-enforcement-officers-killed-in-the-line-of-duty)**. Indeed, a 2006 poll of the Police Federation (which is, as far as I can tell, the union representing many lower level police officers) found 82% of them in favor of keeping the routine ban on **[5] (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19641398)**.  Finally, another consideration is that this is a political decision and not an empirical one. Given the UK's long tradition of firearm restrictions **[6] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_the_United_Kingdom#Gun_control_legislation_in_the_United_Kingdom)**, it would seem as an electorate they are far more comfortable with strong restrictions on firearms. When it comes to police though it seems that public opinion is largely split **[7] (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19641398)**, so maybe there's some room to move there. Finally, as policy makers, we'd also have to consider the enormous costs that this change would bring. We'd have to buy the firearms, buy them regularly due to use and defects, ditto ammo, continually train officers, handle the increased load that shooting inquiries would take, and probably have to pay more for insurance due to a whole new avenue for lawsuits, etc."

The United States is the financial capital of the world. When an investor wants not just a solid investment, but the best investment, it's with the US (its bonds).  However, by not raising the debt ceiling, which causes all the default fun, this will cause massive, massive reactionary spending cuts to kick into effect, sending us back into a recession (Krugman has some more pieces on possibilities but he points to the $600 billion spending cut) and essentially our rating goes from the status as the rock and the hard place to, well, not. What that means is that investors #1 safe investment no longer is safe and that this now safe investment also just dipped into another massive recession in an already iffy economy (we're not in a recession but things such as unemployment are still lagging behind). The very backbone of the entire financial system is now broken.   Your next question might be \"So where do investors turn to?\" The problem is that there is nothing else. The EU isn't safe enough, Asian countries certainly aren't, so with all that, the system goes into chaos. The backbone has been broken and there's no real replacement.   In terms of actions by bondholders, what would most likely happen is nearly every single US bond holder in the world (i.e. everyone involved in investing) will want to get rid of them as fast as they can and, if you didn't already figure it out, cause an enormous financial panic that makes 2008 look like a joke. Unemployment, panic, cash hoarding, etc... It's hard to speculate on a lot of this however since this is the financial backbone to the world. I can't think of another time in history of the financial leader of the world was just like \"Yeah nah.\"  But hey we have until October 16th at 11:59 PM so I'm rooting for Congress."

That was 5 hours ago.    2 hours ago she vomited a yellowish/orange liquid with a piece of paper (I'm assuming this was from an old joint she may have found behind the couch).  Then she got very unstable.    She has a caged in play area and I take her out to interact with her. I did this 5 hours ago as mentioned above.    After she vomited my partner tried to feed her and she refused.  I took her put of her play area to see how she would react in a bigger area.  She wanted to play but was obviously unstable. So we took her to the Er vet and told them we think she ate a roach.  They did a urine drug test and it came back positive for canabis, opiods and benzodiazepines.  They said she could not hold her bladder (due to covid we had to wait in the parking lot).  She didn't have any accidents at our home or in the car.   The only cannabis I smoke is from our government stores (legal in Canada) and it IS possible she found a roach that was missed but I vaccuum every day and try to keep the floor free of anything she could eat.  I do not take opiods and am very careful with my people medication and am certain I did not drop a pill.   They are keeping my dog over night for fluid treatment.  They are saying it was my medication but I am 99.9 percent certain that there is a mistake.    Full disclosure: she did ingest a pill I dropped late last year and that was 100% my fault.  I no longer take that medication.  I count every pill I take when I take them out of the package and as I ingest them.  I am very careful.    Can these tests be wrong?  The doctor said I must be buying drugs that are laced - but I buy them directly from the government.  I don't see a situation where she would have gotten one of my pills as I learned a very painful lesson when I made that mistake before.    How accurate are these tests?  Is there something else I should be looking for?  I want to keep her safe and my partner says she should stay in her play area rather then be out in the living area with us.    He does not want to take her for walks because she could get hurt.  He does not want her to be outside her play area because she could get hurt.

I understand that it would be best for him, and I know it is coming. I think I'm just putting it off as long as possible because I've had him since a child, since he was 8 weeks old and only said goodbye to another of my cats in August of last year, which ripped my heart out. I just feel almost cruel for keeping him alive for my own sake.\n\nAssistant:"

The town I live in is tiny and the vet here is ill equipped; the next city over is a 2 hours car drive where they would have the equipment (i.e. an ultrasound) to try and find the cause of the problem.  Puppy is 5 months old, vaccinated, normally 13.5kg (30lbs) and we rescued him when he was approx 6 weeks old abandoned in a drainage (he's classed as a Southeast Asian village dog by EmbarkVet).  Summary of symptoms:  * Vomits multiple times * Lethargy * Refuses to eat * Weight loss * Very runny stool (occurred only once) * No fever  **Day 1**  I woke my pup up at 7am in his crate to see he's still somewhat asleep. This is weird as normally he'd wake me up and he would usually walk out of the crate within 5 seconds of me opening. We have our morning walk but I cut it short as I see he's not too energetic. I serve him breakfast kibbles and he refused his food. He refused lunch as well. He also refused his treats and would spit it out. I tried chicken breast and he ate it, so I served him a small amount of rice and chicken breast because it concerned me he wasn't taking anything. That was the only meal he had. He was very low energy the whole day and spent his time on the couch chilling. He also did not poop at all this day.  **Day 2**  I woke him up at 7am again to see he has vomited in his crate. He seemed energetic so we had a short walk and he finally pooped (solid stool) and on the way back, he vomited white/yellow foam bile. He vomited again two more times at home. We waited for the nearby vet to open at 9am to bring him. Vet prescribed metoclopramide (for the vomiting?), liver support pills and b-plex. They also gave us Royal Canin Convalesce Support (RCCS) to force feed him. Back home, he ends up vomiting out all the pills we gave and all the food we force fed. He also vomited every time he drank water. Puppy has no energy and we see visible weight loss  **Day 3**  I woke him up at 7am again and he's vomited 2 times in his play pen. We brought him back to the vet and told them about day 2. We asked for an IV drip (administered under the skin) as he was now skin and bones and dehydrated. He's also lost 1.5kg (3lbs). During this time, he had a runny stool outside the vet's office which the vet saw. No blood, just very runny. They prescribed metronidazole (antibiotics) which they helped him take. We also managed to get him to take the metoclopramide and both pills stayed down. We force fed him a small amount of the RCCS 2 hours after the vet visit and he puked it all out 5 minutes after. My SO & I decided to not feed him at all to allow his stomach to recover (after doing some googling) as we notice the vomiting happens after he drinks water or we feed him the RCCS. In the evening, we got him to take the pills but he puked out the antibiotics minutes after he drank a bit of water.  **Day 4**  This is where I'm at now, we just woke him up at 630am and it is now 8am my time. Luckily he hasn't vomited in his pen which is a positive sign but he still refuses food and has no energy. He's looking even thinner than he was yesterday. Our options are either, go to another vet nearby for a second opinion or drive up 2 hours to the city and get him checked there and ask for an ultrasound to see what's going on in his stomach. Or we stick to the prescribed plan and ride it out. We have not given him his pills yet this morning as we fear he may puke it out again. We feel quite defeated that everytime we force feed his pill or food, he is hating us for handling him in such a way and he ends up vomiting soon after.  Any advice?\n\nAssistant:"

We were told she would not make it and the best thing we could do for her is say goodbye. It all happened so fast. She was fine and healthy then suddenly her legs started to give out and she had trouble breathing. They said her body temp was below 90 degrees and she was in shock. She had an embolism and a stroke. They said we could take her to an animal hospital to a cardiologist but after calling the hospital they said in 15 years of emergency medicine a cat has not survived this. I didn\u2019t want to put her through the transport. In my mind it would have to happen immediately and she was so sick.

A few examples off the top of my head:  1) Tylenol will fry a cat\u2019s liver; it\u2019s safe in people.  (I actually heard a story that Tylenol\u2019s release to market was delayed for years because they tested it on cats and the test subjects all got liver failure and died, so they thought it was toxic.  Not sure if that\u2019s actually true.)  2) Human doctors seem to be able to combine NSAIDs and steroids in their patients with no problem. We risk giving our patients a perforating ulcer if we do that.  3) The meloxicam dose for a cat starts at half the dog dose. The suggested dose for a chicken is six times the dog dose. The dose for a rabbit is ten times the dog dose.  Don\u2019t assume that your training on the human side will allow you to safely treat your own critters.  Your question is the equivalent of me asking you how to treat my (human) family members myself.  We\u2019ve all had clients in the human medical field (especially nurses, for some reason) do serious damage to a patient because they assumed they knew what they were doing and didn\u2019t have an understanding of the critical differences between our patients and theirs.  If you want to help your critters, maintain a relationship with your vet, have your pets seen regularly, and make sure to check with them *before* you do something treatment-wise.  If you have questions about something, by all means have that conversation with them - frankly, some days, it would be a relief for most of us to be able to have an intelligent discussion about a treatment plan.  Also, if you could let the human side know that just because animals aren\u2019t actively complaining doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re not in pain, that would be great.  Injuries hurt them just as much as us, and the number of human medical people that flat-up ignore that is too damn high."

It is isn't a case of simply letting all trans athletes compete without any further vetting.  The problem with this discussion is that all too often, it is not done in good faith nor done properly. Far too many people are using this as an opportunity to discredit trans people as a whole. Far too many people are not arguing with validity or soundness. This is especially true on the internet. If you took a university or specialist sports ethics class (or something along those lines), they could very well discuss the pros and cons of integrating trans athletes because it is a more disciplined form of discussion.  In short, due to the nature of online discussions, where nobody has to identify themselves, their credentials, and rarely cite any sources, most of what is said is either deliberate or ignorantly unintentional bullshit. I generally agree with your point that this is an interesting puzzle, but the debates that do take place online are completely toxic.

There are *a lot* of people including myself who will do everything to avoid touching bathroom door handles, because they're disgusting. In an ideal world everyone cleans their hands adequately before leaving a public restroom but we all know that's not the case.   **It's** **Unsanitary:**  Door handles are highly-touched surfaces that provide an excellent method of transmission for viruses and bacteria if not cleaned, and given what restrooms are for, door handles are now the perfect surface for nastier bacteria and viruses to get transmitted. There are very few surfaces in most recently-built public restrooms that a user must touch (given all the automatic toilets, faucets, and paper-towel dispensers), but most still force the user to grab the door handle in order to leave since the doors swing *into* the restroom instead of outwards. This essentially guarantees the user will come into contact with bacteria or viruses lingering on the surface unless they use a barrier.   **It defeats the purpose of handwashing:**  The purpose of handwashing, is to *sanitize* your hands before handling food, touching a wound, or partaking in some activity that creates a situation with higher-than-normal vulnerability to infections. It's been proven that while sanitizing your hands with rubbing alcohol or some other cleaner *is effective,* handwashing is optimal. You wouldn't want your surgeon just throwing some *Purell* on their hands before operating on you! Forcing the user of a restroom to interact with a highly-touched surface that is extremely dirty *after washing their hands,* even with a barrier like paper towel, just defeats the purpose of handwashing!   **Why doors that open outwards are superior:**  The user can push the door outwards with their body to leave, instead of being forced to pull the door open using the handle, meaning their hands can stay \"clean\". Furthermore, since people of all different heights, the **average** concentration of bacteria in one particular spot on the door should theoretically be *less* than on the door handle as the surface area of the door handle is obviously much smaller than the surface area of the entire door, so people who insist on using their hands will be pushing from a larger variety of locations on the door itself.  TLDR: Public restroom doors should open outwards since it's more sanitary.\n\nAssistant:"

Context: In some Latin American countries (mostly south America) people are startiing to change the way they talk to make ''inclusive'' nouns. There 2 tipes of articles in spanish: las y los which in english both would be ''the'', and some extra rules apply to them:  -''Las'' is supposed to be used when you are talking about just female  nouns (nouns can be male or female). Examples:Las revistas (The magazines), Las mujeres (The women), Las ni\u00f1as (The chidren, specifically girls).  -''Los'' is supposed to be used when there is just male objects or a combination of 2 or more genders (since there supposedly are 56+ now). For example: los zapatos (the shoes), los hombres (The men), Los ni\u00f1os (The children, just male or a group of male and female children).  After a while and the women rights movement, people started to use both articles. For example: Las y los compa\u00f1eros (The classmates, both male article (which means anything) and female (Which is extra here)).  Some other solutions have come up as using an ''@'' to say L@s amig@s (The friends, male and female).  This is already a step in the wrong direction, but it was mostly used in politics when talking about women's rights.  Now the fun stuff. With all this movements of the ten thousand genders people started to get offended and ''misrepresented'' in the language itself. Now they all want us to use ''Los'' for male, ''Las'' for female and ''Les'' foe everything else. Even though if we say ''Los'' the language rules say that we are actually referring to the group of people regardless of the genders.   On top of everything they get offended if we don't use Los, las, and les in every single sentence apart from also changing the gender suffix in every word.   So instead of saying los coma\u00f1eros (The classmates), we have to say Los, Las y Les compa\u00f1eros, compa\u00f1eras y compa\u00f1eres for us not to offend anyone.   Also for saying \"them\", we can't use \"Ellos\" to refer to a goup of people regardless of the gender. We have to say Ellos, ellas y elles, which not only sounds super incorrect, but it also is over complicating an already complex part of the language. Because objects also have genders by rule. (We can't say \"la martillo\", we say \"el martillo\" which both translated would be \"the hammer\", another example is  \"La calceta\" which is correct, but \"El calceta\" isn't, both being \"the sock\" in english) How will we know which object is male, female, Agender, alexigender, aliusgender, amicangender, ambonec, Apconsugender, Aquarigender, Cannedgender, circgender, and a long loong etcetera.  Why over complicate ourselves over this little, insignificant thing when there are more and bigger problems than this. Especially in these countries.  This is also happening in California replacing Latino and Latina by Latinx and not saying Hispanic because someway it implies Colonialism. While absolutely nobody has complained about it.  TL;DR: People want to reform an entire language just because some other want to have their very own article. Which will over complicate the already complex system of object genders in Spanish while crating a lot of other problems. All of this while we could be focusing in a lot of more serious things. ____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

While I do not necessarily support the movement, my understanding is that \"les\" is supposed to be a plural article that is gender neutral instead of the male dominant \"los.\"  As every Spanish teacher seems to say, \"even if there is one male in a group with 99 females, you use 'los'.\" The point being made by this movement is that Spanish is a male centric language.

Generally, arguments against Affirmative Action are levied from a conservative (sometimes racist) perspective. Those against AA generally deny the existence of systemic racism or historical injustice against black people in the United States. Opponents of AA also tend to look down upon its recipients, believing that they don't deserve it.  I would consider myself a progressive. I acknowledge that historical injustice and systemic racism exist. However, I am still against AA as a policy for two main reasons: 1) it doesn't use progressive values to approach social justice, and 2) there is insufficient evidence that it is effective policy.  **Affirmative Action isn't progressive.**  * Two foundational progressive ideas are that race is a social construct and social justice should be viewed through an intersectional lens. Keeping these two ideas in mind, AA is not a very progressive policy. * Race is a social construct. That is the most scientific way to look at it. Even from a less academic, more practical standpoint it makes more sense to view race as a social construct. Some black people look Hispanic, some Hispanics look black, other Hispanics look white. Indians can look Hispanic or black depending on the season. The fact that we lump East Asians and Indians into the category of \"Asian\", despite them looking nothing alike or having little to no cultural similarities should make you question the way we view race in America. At one point in American history, Irish and Italian immigrants weren't considered white and were called white n-words, so even the category of \"white\" isn't fixed. * If you accept this premise that race is a social construct, then race-based AA becomes very complicated; it becomes very difficult to gauge who \"deserves\" AA. Why do Hispanics who look white receive AA when Indians that look black do not? What about mixed race children? Indians, Irishmen, Italians, ethnic Jews, Chinese, and Japanese\u2014while they weren't enslaved like black people\u2014faced massive discrimination historically, and in some cases are still victims of discrimination today, yet these groups don't benefit from AA at all. * Intersectionality is the idea that social categories such as race, class, and gender are interconnected and combine to create unique levels of discrimination and privilege. This further complicates the role of AA. Why should white women benefit the most from AA? Should Nigerian immigrants, who are arguably the most successful ethnic group in the US and whose ancestors have not been victims of slavery in America, benefit from AA? It could also be argued that it is unfair not to consider class. Why should a white female student coming from an affluent family receive AA over a white male student coming from a destitute family? What about transgender students? Should a trans male receive AA because he is trans, or because he was/is biologically female, or should he be seen as having male privilege?  **Affirmative Action is not effective.**  * The stated goal of AA is to address racial inequality by providing opportunities to marginalized groups that have been squandered by historically racism and/or current systemic racism. I don't believe there is sufficient evidence to suggest that AA is effective policy for achieving that goal. One of the most comprehensive studies on AA concludes that its efficiency is ambiguous at best and the redistributive effects may not be large. Given that AA has been around for over 50 years and its effects are ambiguous at best, I feel like it is safe to say it is not effective. * An analysis of 45 studies on AA suggests that it can perpetuate negative stigmas. So, not only is AA not very effective, it can also be harmful.  **Conclusion**  * I see AA as trying to use a band-aid to patch a severe laceration. It may or may not help, but there are more effective ways to deal with the issue of social injustice. Also, implementing AA without committing social injustice in the process seems very complicated when considering intersectionality and the socially constructed nature of race.  **Better Solutions IMO**  * End the war on drugs. Blacks use and sell drugs at similar rates as whites, but are 6.5 times as likely to be incarcerated for drug-related crimes. Ending the drug war could end the mass incarceration of black and brown men in America. Being raised in a single-parent household is associated with more juvenile crime, worse educational outcomes, behavioral and emotional issues, etc. Less incarceration could mean more intact families and better outcomes for black and brown children. * Improve access to abortion and contraceptives. This can also help combat teenage pregnancies and reduce single-parent households. * Don't fund schools from property taxes. Poorer (often black) neighborhoods levy less property taxes, which leads to underfunded schools. Education should be the great equalizer, but this system amplifies inequality between the rich and the poor. * I believe these solutions, unlike AA, are closer to targeting the root causes of the racial inequality in America today. That being said, I am not a policy expert. These are just some of the many potential solutions.\n\nAssistant:"

This is a common misconception.  Modern-day AA in education at least is justified by diversity; reparations are not a valid justification per Bakke.  The idea is that \"diversity\" (of which racial diversity is one component) overall increases the value of the overall classroom \\- that is affirmative action is not per se exclusively for the preferred group but creates a better environment for all students by allowing more diverse views to be present.  \\Many private employers use similar framing\\]  Consequently, AA policies to promote diversity can act very different from ones to amend for historical injustice at the extreme:  * Mandating Chinese American students [test higher than white students to get into an elite high school. * Offering white-only scholarships to a historically black university * Granting Asian students preferential treatment in some contexts but not others.  For instance, Vietnamese and Filipino students are considered under-represented in some contexts (law), but not others (general undergraduate admissions).  Or probably even when applying to humanities, but not STEM.  That said, any AA program that considers race at this point is supposed to be narrowly tailored and consider the individual holistically \\[Fisher),  Adarand Contractors, etc.\\], so in theory the edge cases you cite shouldn't be happening under policies conforming to law. \\personal opinion: many programs are not conforming to law\\]  All said, there is criticism here that racial diversity is only one of many metrics and some [progressives do note that a purely class-based approach would still produce racially diverse environments without all the backlash racial preferences creates.  There's also the major problem that this can be cover for discrimination (is the institution selecting against Jewish students because it doesn't like them or to promote more \"diversity\"?)"

One of the stated purposes is to explore private big cat ownership\u2014in fact, that is stated outright in the first episode by director Eric Goode\u2014and yet it rarely delves into the *big cat* part of that topic. Instead, the bulk of the documentary is a circus freak show, using these people and their personalities for pure entertainment, combined a bit with a thread of true crime and the story of how Joe Exotic went to jail and how Baskin allegedly murdered her husband, the tigers and other big cats serving simply as a backdrop.  As a result, the series attempts to equivocate the roadside zoos like the GW Zoo with Carole Baskin's Big Cat Rescue, when in fact there are several key differences between them that are relevant to the documentary's supposed topic:  1. Guest interaction, including cub petting, feeding, and playing with the animals.  2. Staff interaction, including entering the enclosures with the animals unnecessarily, moving or feeding animals unsafely, and removing cubs from mothers and keeping them in cribs in the home.  3. Using the animals for profit, and euthanizing them when they are no longer profitable.  4. Most importantly, irresponsibly breeding, including crossbreeding, captive animals for profit. Zoos and other institutions accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums that breed animals take precautions to increase genetic diversity as much as possible, with the goal of conservation and re-introduction to the wild. The breeding that GW Zoo and Antle engage in encourage inbreeding and genetic homogeneity. The crossbred animals serve no conservation purpose whatsoever, and the inbred cubs are separated from their mothers and destined to continue the cycle of private ownership of big cats.  That's not to say Big Cat Rescue is perfect\u2014it and Carole Baskin have their own issues to be sure\u2014but these are some of the most problematic aspects of private ownership of wild animals, and yet they get very little attention in the show. I have seen several reactions online that fail to grasp these distinctions or see the Big Cat Rescue as equally bad as places like the GW Zoo.  The series doesn't help in that regard, as they clearly try to play up the rivalry between Joe Exotic and Carole Baskin, and allow Joe's claims that GW Zoo is the same as Big Cat Rescue go relatively unchallenged except by Carole herself, playing up that rivalry. Tim Stark at one point makes the claim that breeding is beneficial to endangered animals because they increase the number of tigers, something that is completely and utterly false (the animals they breed are completely unsuited for release, due to genetics and how they are raised), and yet there is no push back from the documentary at all. There are no interviews with professional zookeepers, biologists, veterinarians, or anyone from the AZA, people who would be authorities on animal care and welfare.  If the series wanted to be solely about the interpersonal drama of these people, that'd be fine. They are admittedly entertaining. However, the series intersperses enough tidbits that focus on *some* of the problems with big cats in captivity that it is easy to mistake it as being about that. The scenes of Joe separating cubs from their mother, accidents at the zoo, or of the aftermath of the zoo in Zanesville show some of the dangers of big cat ownership. But what makes those parks different from genuine sanctuaries, rescues, and zoos is not explored. There's no juxtaposition to places that are able to keep big cats responsibly, and Carole Baskin and Big Cat Rescue are lumped in with the others for the sake of drama.  I see this as a critical failure given the stated mission of the documentary to explore big cats in captivity. It actively misleads its audience if they are coming to learn about animals in captivity. The comments I have seen online just reinforce that. Instead of educating viewers on animals in captivity, most seem to be confused as to what exactly makes roadside zoos and private ownership of big cats so harmful for the animals. They glorify or defend Joe Exotic, despite him engaging in outright animal abuse, while attacking Carole Baskin and Big Cat Rescue because she is portrayed as unlikable or phony.\n\nAssistant:"

Just to get this out of the way in the beginning, although this view is partially based on the current Democrat primary, I do not care which of them wins. This isn't an attempt to sway the vote for or away from a particular candidate.   OK, so here are my thoughts.   First: Voting for a candidate just because you think that they can be elected in the general election is ineffectual. If a person is actually \"electable\" then the odds are that they will be able to win the primary anyway. One of the goals of the primary should be to determine if they actually do have the skills and personal appeal to get people to vote for them. Using eligibility as a factor to cast your vote short circuits this process.  Second: You, as a partisan primary voter, probably do not have a good sense of who is actually electable in the general election anyway. It is likely that you are fairly biased toward your own political philosophy and can't fairly  judge who would appeal to moderate voters. You are just voting for the person who everyone else is telling you is electable.   Third: Let's face it, the word \"electable\" in this context is essentially going to be synonymous with \"boring and inoffensive\". A candidate who is running on their electability is not going to be someone who is generating excitement.   Looking back over the past few elections, how well has the \"electable\" candidate faired? Bob Dole, Al Gore, John Kerry, John McCain, and Mitt Romney were all classic \"electable candidates\". They were all elder statesmen, with impressive credentials, who generated little enthusiasm. They all lost.  How well did the upstart radical candidates do?   Barack \"Hussein\" Obama was a black candidate with the middle name of a terrorist dictator. He had very little experience with politics. He had a shady backstory. On paper, not electable.     Donald Trump was a New York billionaire who most people knew as a host of a reality TV show. He insulted people, had questionable financial dealings, and was constantly making controversial statements. Also, not someone who would be considered to be electable.   They both won, and they won because people were excited to vote for them.  That's pretty much my view. Feel free to vote for who you want to vote for.\n\nAssistant:"

It becomes not about who is the best candidate, or even who the most would vote for, but rather who can win the electoral college. So, for instance, if you have two equally matched candidates for the democratic party, but one is from California and one is from MI, you might pick the one from MI to increase the odds of winning MI since CA is basically a freebie for a democrat. So in some, maybe even most, cases, the most electable candidate might win the primary too, but in some situations, like possibly the 2020 election, that's not the case. If things are sufficiently polarized where the vast majority of people will just vote for a particular party then picking the candidate that will best get the people who haven't \"picked\" a party is the best option, especially if those voters are in swing states. I do agree it's a shitty system and one that should be changed, but if you think Yang best matches your values, but will lose to many moderate votes in swing states, then maybe you want'd Biden, thinking he's a lesser of evils and will more likely get those moderate votes. 2. I think moderates have a good sense of who moderates would vote for, but more to the point, you don't need to go based on your opinion, you can take expert's opinion and polls.  3. Electability varies wildly from election to election. JFK and Reagan were very electable because they were exciting and charming. Carter won because the country didn't like Ford, and H Bush won because he was pragmatic. In fact some argue the worst thing to happen to McCain was bringing on Sarah Palin, an upstart radical. I'm not saying upstart radical always win or lose, I'm just saying it's election dependent and shouldn't be generalized."

I believe that the electoral college is unhealthy for a democracy such as our own, and that a presidential candidate elected from anything other than a popular vote is unfair for voters.   As the situation stands today, presidential candidates spend a majority of their campaigns in swing states, hoping to win over that state and increase their chance of getting elected. The most fair option would be to switch to a popular vote, as the president is supposed to represent the people\u2019s wants equally.   The original purpose of the electoral college was to provide the country a means of \u201csaving itself\u201d: the electorates would be an educated group that could override the citizens of the US if they made an uneducated decision. However, with more restrictions binding electorates to choose the candidate their constituents voted for, that purpose is no longer served.   At the very least (if popular vote is not an option), there should be no winner take all states, as that means that if a candidate wins a swing state by a small margin, they get all of the electoral votes.

The hunting of animals for the main purpose of collecting trophies is a practice that causes massive amounts of damage to ecosystems, drives our most beautiful animals to extinction and is unethical not only on this basis, but on the fact that it is needless murder of a sentient being.  This applies particularly to African big game such as lions, giraffes, rhino (whoops too late), elephants etc but also to any animal hunted purely for sport.  A law that made each participating nation able to prosecute its citizens even if they went to a non-participating country to hunt would be the most effective way to deal with this.  Most of the hunters hunting big game are rich westerners, if they were able to be brought up on charges when they returned home with trophies or with pictures of them hunting lions etc splashed across their social media, it would give many a pause for thought. Outlawing ivory was a similar step but hasn't done enough.  For those who will suggest that hunting is a major economic factor in some places: the fact that it makes someone money is simply not a good enough reason to allow anything unethical. Plus, people who run hunting tours could switch to other forms of income like safaris etc and they would if the flow of hunters dried up.  For those who suggest it's a suitable conservation method: a) the most valuable (both in monetary value and prestige) big game hunted for sport are often endangered species.  B) you can control populations of other non endangered big game with means that don't glorify the killing of animals for sport.  I want to clarify that hunting for food and resources is something else entirely and I have no real issue with it if it's a necessity.

And if it is set up to insentivise the protection of animals from the poachers so that a small amount can be sold off at a premium price for trophy hunting then the animals will survive.  The biggest success of this was in Namibia and south Africa where the Rhino population skyrocketed after they started using trophy hunting. The trophy hunting money also goes towards funding conservation and locals, and the meat of the animals can go towards feeding locals.

Here is an exchange between a friend of mine and myself, which he abandoned :(, in which I outline what I think would be a reasonable alternative strategy to wallbuilding and fix for some of the employment/economic problems of US immigration enforcement. I would like to continue the conversation with you all and invite commentary about the potential pitfalls of my design (as I do not believe it is at all the overall best solution to the immigration/employment problem, merely a system that could potentially work given the aims outlined in my title, in a vacuum), as well as direct opposition on the basis of a wall or different priorities being somehow better than this approach.  My assumption is that a physical barrier isn't effective at keeping people out, if there is sufficient incentive for them to get in. I realize my friend's argument isn't the most cohesive so I am really only including it for context on the premise. Thanks for reading.  Friend:       Have you ever worked with anyone that shouldn\u2019t be in America? I\u2019ll tell you a story about a guy named Luis. He can claim tax exempt. Has free healthcare. Gets EBT, I know because this is how he bought lunch one day. \\[Il\\]legitimately taking a job of an unemployed legal American. Working in the construction field for over 10 years has opened my eyes to the fact that no ones cares they are here they just want everything to be fair. Same healthcare opportunities, same taxes, same pay. But what I have seen is that contractors get what they pay for. Sloppy work and constant call backs. But in reference to the wall. Why does one build a fence? Is it to keep the nonsense out or keep the dog in? I say get rid of the what if\u2019s about the wall. Build it first to keep the President's promise. I believe he was asking for a little more than 2 billion for it out of a budget in the trillions. Best case scenario is we just put people to work. Essentially giving the money back to the people. Build it. Kill the argument.  My response:       My counter-proposal to your anti-immigrant sentiment is to hold the unpatriotic employers of illegal workers accountable for their illegal employment practices. If there is genuinely an American ready and willing to take a job currently being held by someone without documents, the employer of that illegal worker is culpable for cutting his fellow American out of the workforce. The employer should pay the taxes, and the benefits, and the healthcare for every illegal employee that can be proven on their payroll- as they would typically with any other employee- and pay the equivalent of a median unemployment salary for the American he has disenfranchised, and pay fines on top of it to fund enforcement of the law. That would fix every complaint \\^ you have about Luis except his shoddy workmanship...  It would remove the incentive for employers to utilize illegal labor through strict penalties. It would shift the tax burden from everyone to just the law breakers. If employers stopped employing illegal labor, it would reduce demand and not as many people would come here. Once all that deterrent is in place, we just need to enforce everything better. Perhaps you are asking why I would prefer to punish the American businesses and not punish the immigrants? The answer to that is that the immigrants mostly have no power and nothing to take away. If an immigrant comes here and works illegally, they only have their wages. If we take the job away from them, they can't pay fines, or taxes. Jailing and deporting them costs us money, not them. It's better to remove the incentive for them to be here, and have them go away on their own, or follow the proper channels (revise the VISA program, but maintain the onus of tracking on employers?) and get in legally. If you really want to solve this problem, that's the way you do it. As long as there is demand, and incentive for people to come here illegally, and for employers to employ them illegally without sufficient deterrent, people are going to find a way.\n\nAssistant:"

Also why the government won't go for it.  &#x200B;  The problem is as always money.  Companies must be profitable or investors will refuse to give them the money they need to expand and grow.  And with the power that Wall Street now has, this is actually magnified to a huge degree.  (I know everyone likes to blame 'big business' for many of the ills of society, but its actually 'big money' that drives the decisions since upset Wall Street investors can destroy a CEO's career.)  So companies find that due to the massive amount of competition from overseas factories, they need to drive their own costs down if they are to stay profitable.  &#x200B;  But the US and State governments, in an attempt to protect workers have put in so many laws that many low level jobs are actually a detriment to the company.  These are positions they need to fill, but that cost them far more than any benefit they receive.  Yes, you could say the fact that they don't get fined for having unsanitary bathrooms is a huge benefit, but the reality is that unless someone complains, they are unlikely to get fined.  still a clean bathroom means happier and hopefully more productive employees, so you pay for janitors.  There are many other jobs like this, where the immediate benefit is very low, but there is a financial reason to employ people.  Its just the cost of complying with government regulations makes the price for filling these roles very expensive.  &#x200B;  So companies look for ways around the problem.  They figured out long ago that illegal immigrants are far more likely to accept low pay, poor working conditions and unreasonable demands, since the illegal immigrant isn't able to complain to the government.  (they'd be deported even if the company does get fined.)  So many companies are quite happy to ignore the law.  &#x200B;  And government doesn't enforce it.  Which falls into 2 categories.  The Rethugican side doesn't because they love business and want to make big business happy, and big business wants to have cheap labor.  The Demonrats don't enforce it because they see these immigrants as exploited people who will merrily vote for them in all future elections, giving the D party near permanent control over the government.  &#x200B;  The people lose.    &#x200B;  So while I'd love to agree with you on punishing the businesses.  The problem is first you have to break Wall Street's power so that CEOs and other executives are willing to look for a long term solution to their labor needs and not just looking for the quickest way to save money.  But to do that you'll need to break the back of big government and remove a lot of regulations that manage to drive the cost of hiring a person up so high that having someone who is desperate and scared working for your company is a benefit, even if it is illegal.  &#x200B;  then you can enforce the labor laws without having a mutiny that would get to Wall Street and immediately work to crash the government.  &#x200B;  Its a vicious cycle and yes, the wall isn't the best way to fix it.  But all the better ways are politically impossible at the moment."

For example, Cobb county in Georgia cut off funding for local parks so it could contribute to a new stadium for the Atlanta Braves. I understand that sports teams and stadiums provide economic benefits (jobs, local shops/bars, other sales, etc.), but studies repeatedly show that the economic benefits rarely make up for these huge expenditures on stadiums.  It's a fiscally irresponsible use of limited local and state funds.

You just need to put them on a very delicate wash and make sure you shape them as you dry them. If you have a shaping hanger, this helps. It literally looks kinda like a torso. These are usually unlined suits so they don\u2019t have any real structure to them.   Wool or wool blend?

However, on more expensive suits there is a structure underneath the suit, it\u2019s usually made out of horse hair and it\u2019s really delicate. You can actually damage this just by folding it wrong or leaning on it in a weird way but you absolutely don\u2019t want to get it wet.

Some do indeed grow forever, like your head hair (if you're lucky.) They age and fall out due to a lot of different reasons including what you eat and how healthy you are.  Hairs that don't grow forever get their length determined in the genes of the cells in the follicle. But how do they sense their length?  Longer hairs wiggle! Cells in the follicle can sense mechanical stress as well as grow hairs.  Say we talk about a hair in your leg, just above your ankle.  As it grows, moving in life causes it to wiggle a certain amount. Just a little bit at first.  Then as it gets longer it's more likely to catch air currents,  rub on things,  and get pulled more.  The follicle knows how much wiggle is associated with how long the hair is. If it wiggles just a little it'll hang on to the hair.  If it wiggles to much it stops growing the hair and may even let it go after a certain amount of time.  Incidentally you can see this work,  especially around the ankle when people wear socks for a long time. The constant movement of the sock on the ankle can sometimes make hair growth finer or even stop it entirely.  This happens in athletes.  Now on the other side of the spectrum,  people that wear socks for to long but don't move, say when they're in a coma, usually grow very long ankle hairs because there is no wiggle.  **Update:** TLDR at the bottom. I am so excited to see all the interest in my answer for why we have funny hairs! I came back to see a number of comments expanding upon my explanation, but also some that rightfully sought further explanation, hopefully with evidence based research. After about 10 hours of intensive investigation (this covid thing has done weird things to me) I've come up with a couple points that may or may not be of interest. I thought I'd break it into different contents.  1. **As a Human Journey:** I swear to God I thought I had it right. I was honestly surprised that I didn't see the obvious only right answer posted here. I *knew* I learned about this in histology. Absolutely *knew* without any doubt at all. As a result I wrote it up without second guessing. I didn't include sources and didn't double check anything afterwards. Everyone, be careful what you think you *know*. I'm a pretty educated person but I'm not always right. The worst is embarking on a 10 hour research quest through available literature to *make* myself right. At the very least I was hoping I'd be able to absolve myself of totally making something up. I still don't really know if I did but suffice to say I can't find where I came up with this explanation as I described it. I swear I've know the \"wiggle\" explanation for years. Weird, but okay.  *Mea culpa* for sure. Bs can happen to (or be made up by) the best of us. Lastly, I absolutely loved hearing all the anecdotes and appreciate the interest in just a Explain like I'm five years old. I'm so glad I learned about people's watches, toes, wizard eyebrows, and pooping habits. 2. **As a Scientist:** Always include sources where you are able, especially if you endeavor to teach others. u/Darthskull and u/marklein had exactly the right idea. That being said, no one who believed my explanation at face value should feel like a bad scientist. It's still a kick ass explanation that appears to have testable effects. It is a pretty neat hypothesis for sure. Buuuuuut I guess it hasn't been tested specifically. I'll get to that below. Early moral is to be careful quickly accepting explanations that sound like the right answer immediately. Late lesson is again that I went searching in order to prove my hypothesis correct when I was called on it. That is so, so dangerous in science. We cannot look for articles and information that tell us what we want to hear. This applies in every aspect of life but especially in science.  Find your data, interpret it, then decide what you think. Any other order carries with it the potential for misunderstanding, bias, and concerning inaccuracies. After albeit too much research, the last moral may turn out to be that not all BS is worthless. Some of the best ideas come from the nugget of ~~corn~~ truth yielded by BS. I do think there is potential for actual honest to God real scientific testing. 3. **As a Brand New Hair Researcher:** (This is decidedly **not** Explain like I'm five years old and requires some pretty good foundational biochem. Also a good handle of other top answers.) Many of the other answers in this thread have indicated or hinted at where the current body of research regarding hair growth has brought us. Hair growth science is of particular interest to experts in evolutionary biology, pharmaceuticals, and nearly every field of medicine, from dermatology to oncology. That being said there is a huge amount that is not known. I think I still might be wrong, but there's a chance in all that vague \"black box\" process \"wiggle theory\" might come out okay.  As many have stated (and copy and pasted \\only throwing gentle shade\\]), the most generally accepted and well tested explanation for OP's original question entails a temporally limited cell cycling within the follicle. Anagen, Catagen, and Telogen have been measured numerous times in both in vitro and in vivo models. They appear relatively stable within individual follicles. The length of these cycles and, by extension, the general growth of the hair can be altered appropriately based upon physiologic need at initial cell line differentiation. These are frequently geographic distributions. These basic blueprints would be subject to varying biochemical marker gradients and gene expression.  [Hair Cycle Clock. Follicular Cell Cycling  Both hormonal regulation as well as localized gene expression can alter the length of the anagen stage in particular. Otherwise, these stages progress rather autonomously with or without extrinsic stimuli. From what we can tell, differing hair types, and likely their maximum lengths become set. As we age or undergo stress, there can be measurable and dramatic changes in the cycling time but there isn't an indication that there is significant plasticity due to extrinsic stimuli on the follicle itself. MAYBE.  So many aspects of localized cellular behaviors are dictated by biochemical milieu and equilibrium it would be nigh impossible to exclude cytokine and chemotactic processes from affecting follicles. The oft attributed TNF, TGF, and FGF may play a large role in actually causing cycling but, hell, they play a large role in a lot of things. What can be said is that at some point anagen activation must outweigh inhibitory mechanisms lest catagen begin and the follicle begins to atrophy.  We don't know what stimuli could cause increases in localized biochemical inhibitors. Some may prove to be tactile in nature, but it has not been characterized as of yet. Could repeated abrasion from a sock, or continued tensile stress influence follicular cell cycling? Could be. This would have to be distinctly different than previously characterized pathology (traction allopecia, Stress induced hair loss, etc). This would have to be physiology! This would be characterized as extrafollicular skin signalling. There is obvious indication that this does exist but again seems to affect larger regions or groups of follicles rather than individual follicles. Again, there does not appear to be an intrafollicular process for this known at this time.  CONTINUED IN REPLY  TLDR: I accidentally thought this was an easy question that I could easily answer, and did. Turns out everyone was right to question my answer despite other seemingly promising anecdotal applications and ostensibly sound reasoning. I didn't have the data or the research to back it up. I researched for 10 hours through primary literature review in an effort to find out where I came up with it and maybe to make me right. Probably am not right but learned a lot about hair. The other answers represent the most widely accepted explanations."

If you press against your belly and feel something hard, you are pushing against your muscles.  If you have a big belly, but it's hard that means that you have a lot of visceral fat. Visceral means deep. It feels hard because you are pressing the muscle, but there's a lot of fat behind the muscle which causes your gut to bulge.  This visceral fat is very dangerous. It's right next to your organs, so it can \"spill into them\". You can get non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, for example. Visceral fat is the thing most associated with heart attacks, stroke, diabetes, etc. In fact, measuring your waist size is probably even better than measuring your weight or BMI.

Visible light is several hundred terahertz, and is a more than a wee bit out out range.   To produce visible light different a different mechanism is used. Instead of electrons shifting around in wires, the electrons jump up and down different energy levels in atoms. When they jump down in energy like in an LED, they release energy. When a photon is absorbed by something like a photodiode the electron that absorbs it jumps up a level and generated a tiny bit of current that can be sensed.  As for why you cant detect visible waves with an antenna the corresponding antenna length has to get shorter to resonate with higher frequency em waves. However it's not impossible. There is research into nanoantennas which may be used to detect visible light and x-rays   One really interesting way to generate em waves of pretty much any frequency from radio waves to x rays is called a free electron laser. Basically you take an electron from a particle acceleretor and lob it past alternating magnets. The electron wiggles a bit passing the magnets and therefore generates an em wave corresponding to it's speed/frequency of the wiggles."

                "content": " The modern atomic model is the result of about 70 years of many different attempts to understand the nature of atoms. The basic approaches involved people a) speculating about how they _might_ work (theory) and b) doing experiments that would either confirm or deny some of these speculations, or give information that could prompt more speculations (experiment). Sometimes theory went first, sometimes experiment went first, but the back-and-forth was how they figured it out.  For example. The idea of atoms \u2014\u00a0of there being \"units\" of chemistry \u2014 became popular in the 18th century as part of the Chemical Revolution. It was a very useful way to understand how chemical reactions worked. But nobody had much of an idea of what these atoms _were_ other than a way to understand chemistry. So you could say, if I have some atoms of hydrogen and some atoms of oxygen and I subject them to a spark, it will cause a (pretty violent) reaction that will end up with water, which is made of both hydrogen and oxygen somehow merged together.   There was a scientist named William Prout who in the early 19th century basically said, I bet that the difference between a hydrogen atom and an oxygen atom is related to them being made out of different amounts of the same stuff. That is, that atoms were themselves made of pieces (\"subatomic particles\"), and that hydrogen might have some number of these and oxygen might have another number. Prout theorized that there was only one type of subatomic particle.   Later in the century, an experimental physicist, J.J. Thomson, became interested in weird \"rays\" that seemed to be produced through experimental devices called cathode ray tubes (the same kinds of tubes that made old TVs work). People had already discovered, sort of through tinkering, that if you passed an electric current through a vacuum in the right way, it made some kind of rays come out the other side that could be detected with the right equipment. But nobody knew why this worked or what the rays were.   Thomson said, ah, let's study the rays and see (based on a hypothesis) if they might be something like Prout's hypothetical subatomic particle! So he did some very careful observations that proved that the rays coming out were tiny particles with strong electric charges that could be bent by a magnet. He declared that what was happening in a cathode ray tube is that it was breaking down atoms into their subatomic pieces, and what was being shot through them was a Proutian particle that Thomson dubbed the corpuscle. Everybody thought that was a dumb name and used \"electron\" instead.   To accompany this idea, Thomson suggested that maybe atoms were just big lumps of electrons that were somehow all rotating around each other. A single atom might have hundreds of electrons in it in Thomson's model. This, he argued, explained the cathode ray tubes, and also explained (in its own way) the link between matter and electricity.  Cool idea, said other scientists, but they were never totally sold on it. Ernest Rutherford and his students tried an experiment to see if atoms worked the way Thomson thought. They used a source of alpha radiation (which had been recently discovered, but itself not understood) to shoot particles through a very thin foil of gold. If Thomson was right, and atoms were composed of just a bunch of swirling little electrons, the alpha particle (which was a positively-charged, relatively large particle) should just fly right through them. And most of them did fly right through. But some of them got reflected backwards at a very sharp angle. It is\u00a0sort of like what would happen if you through a tennis ball at a single metal pole: most of the time you'd miss, but if you hit the pole, it'd bounce right back at you. (How'd they \"see\" these particles? They had a setup by which they could tell how many particles hit a detector, basically, so they could just count the \"hits\" and where they were.)  From this data, Rutherford reasoned that Thomson's model couldn't be right. That there probably was a cloud of electrons, but that something very small, but very hard, was located in the center of the atom \u2014 the thing the alpha particles were being reflected by. He dubbed this the \"nucleus,\" which is just a Greek word that means \"kernel\" (like the seed at the center of a peach), and posited that it probably contained most of the mass of the atom and that it was positively charged, unlike the electron. The electrons, he guessed, might rotate around the nucleus like planets rotating around a Sun. So this is sometimes called the \"planetary\" model of the atom.  And so on, and so on. Later theory figured out that electrons can't work like planets; they'd run out of energy. Explaining how they could work required inventing quantum theory and quantum mechanics. Experiments showed how that did and didn't work as well. The nucleus itself became something to investigate, and various experiments showed that it contained subatomic particles of its own (protons, neutrons) and, by the 1960s, that even these contained their own sub-subatomic particles (quarks). In this time they also figured out how to split heavy nuclei (fission) and fuse light nuclei (fusion), and figure out in great detail how these different parts of the atom worked, what forces they were subjected to, and so on.  Obviously I'm summarizing a lot, but you can see that a) they didn't need to \"see\" an atom at any time in this, because they could infer things from experiment, b) there was a complicated and intertwined back and forth between theory and experiment the whole way through, and c) ultimately they ended up with a model that does a _very_ good job of answering questions we might have of it, and which is built into all sorts of applied settings, so it must be somewhat accurate, though there always may be something new to learn."

Of course, this upset me... but if I'm quite honest, I don't really understand the whole 'depression' thing.   Personally, I have never had issues with depression. I've dealt with the standard negative aspects of life that most people go through such as grief, bereavement, stress, illness, financial struggles etc. but for me, it has never been more than a few days/weeks of gloominess before I'm back to my old self.

But life throws you asshole drivers who cut into your lane and merge without their turn signals. You find yourself forced more and more into the inner lanes and farther and farther away from your exit.  Soon, it's difficult even to find that exit that leads to happiness. As you circle around in the roundabout, you're not even sure which exit is the one you wanted. You circle slower and slower as you realize, you'll never get out of this roundabout. Then you park your car at the center and start to think it's not even worth driving anymore.  That is depression. The downward spiral of external events coupled with your emotions that leaves you less and less able to deal with the stresses of reality.  Some people are able to bounce back from the terrible drivers in life while others slowly drift towards the center and never find the exits. This may be due to genetic or environmental factors.  It's a cycle that can't be \"snapped out\" off. It really requires the individual to fight their selves to get out of the spiral.

Here's a illustration showing roughly that while it varies, even under intense exercise the blood cells still hold on to 35% of the oxygen. That means under typical situations you only have access to 65% of max oxygen pool in your blood. Now that is extremely simplified to the point where I should add caveats but you should get the general idea that that 7% difference is much closer to 11%, and any further drop in O2 is actually a larger impact than the flat % would suggest."

EMI, Electromagnetic Interference, is a serious consideration in aircraft design and operation, and has been for decades.  I highly recommend this NASA report from 1995, PDF here, which details several incidents, aviation and otherwise. Probably one of the most famous is the series of five UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters that crashed between 1981 to 1987. The accidents were a mystery for some time, but it was later confirmed that they were caused by signals from radio tower which caused the stabilator to go to a full down position, which put the helicopter in a dive. These accidents earned the UH-60 the nickname \"lawn dart\" at the time.   IIRC in the 1990s it was quite common for the crew to instruct passengers to turn off all electronic devices for take off and landing. This is because it was not uncommon for devices to cause things like radio static or in severe cases minor interference with navigation.  To be clear, I'm not sure that consumer grade electronics ever posed a deadly threat to commercial aircraft. However, EMI shielding and testing was not nearly as thorough back then as it is now. Part of the reason for that is small electronic devices were not ubiquitous back then. Asking people to simply turn off an electronic device during take off and landing (critical phases of flight for navigation and radio communication) was not a big deal to people back then. It was easier for the FAA to just require that they be turned off, than to require extensive (and expensive) testing.   Additionally, I'm not aware of any credible sources which say that the reasoning was that passengers would pay more attention in the event of an emergency. It was certainly my personal experience that back then passengers stuck their noses in magazines and books as much as they do their cell phones and laptops now. If that was ever an official reason it was almost certainly not very effective.  **The FAA's decision a few years ago to officially allow electronic devices at all phases of flight was, as far as I can tell, for two reasons: better understanding of the risks because of increased testing, and the fact that we all knew people were doing it anyway.**"

Where to go from here? in California My uncle died about 2 weeks ago. His son, my cousin, is 24 years old and is severally mentally disabled. He is completely non-verbal and has frequent violent outbursts. He has been living in a small facility for about 4 years now. My uncle has been paying the facility directly the entire time. They are in California, I am in WA state.   Last week my mom forwarded me an email from a lawyer claiming to represent my uncle. It includes an \"informal\" will. \"Informal\" because it is literally scrawled on the back of some random papers, and the exact phrase in it that pertains to me is \"*wut2do22* should be in charge of *cousin* if I die and she should have any of the money I have left over for taking care of him\".  I emailed the lawyer back, asked him exactly what this meant for me right now and he basically said that he was looking into clarifying a few things in the will and would get back to me shortly, and that if I wanted legal advice as far as conservatorship/etc goes I should seek my own lawyer. The second part of that makes sense, he doesn't work for free, but I do not understand what he meant by clarifying some things in the will. Is a will written by somebody without the involvement of an attorney/notary/typical will people still valid? Am I going to automatically become the guardian/conservator for my cousin?   I should add here, that although I love my cousin and am definitely going to be making the effort to be more involved in his life, none of this had been discussed with me at all. My uncle was having medical issues for a while now, and we are not very close. He and my mother don't get along very well, and for better or worse we have not been in each other's lives much. I do not know why he would have said that in his will, other than the fact that I don't know if he has anybody else he could name (ex wife, cousin's mother, died a while ago).   So, the facility my cousin lives at called me today and told me that I'm named as the family emergency contact. They were really nice, gave me a bunch of options as far payment extension and charity goes, and told me the due date for the next bill. This place is around $5500/month. I work PT while in school, my income (including my loan) is right around $1200/mo when you divide it up. Even if they halved the bill for this month, I couldn't come close to making it, and then there would be the month after that...  So what do I do? Is there some way to keep my cousin in the facility that he's been comfortably living in for 4 years? Am I automatically responsible for him, as a guardian? A conservator? Conservatorship seems like it has a lot to do with financial aspects, which aren't really relevant here as my cousin does not have any assets - and although I do not know what my uncle's financial situation was when he died, he had declared bankruptcy a few years ago and had gotten himself into more debt fairly recently.   I'm at such a loss of what to do here. My mom is willing to pitch in some money for a lawyer, but our combined amount we can spend is around $500 right now. And that could just be going to try to pay the bill at the facility, so at this point I'm going to try to look into a law office at the school in a nearby city to see if they could offer free advice. In the meantime, if anybody could shed some light on the situation, that would be much appreciated.\n\nAssistant:"

Your cousin is literally an independent adult right now who is not capable of making decisions.     3. You have 0 legal obligation to pay your cousin's bills and if the facility misled you to make you think that the bills are now yours then that facility is ran by assholes scammers.  Again, you have 0 legal liability for any of your cousin's bills.        4. You dont need to get a lawyer at all UNLESS....you want to get power of attorney for your cousin or to become your cousin's legal guardian.  If you dont want to do these things then dont waste  a dime on a lawyer.   5. Your cousin is literally on their own and has Social Security Disability payments.  Your options are:   A. find a place that will take care of your cousin in exchange for his SSD payments. You can try to find the best place.   B. Let your cousin live with you and you try to care for him using his SSD income payments.    Get a lawyer to get guardianship or POA.   C.  Do nothing and let the current facility either decide to let him live there for SSD payments or for them to find a place to ship him to.      I suggest option A first and then option C as a last resort.    I would not even consider option B.   My aunt had downs syndrome and was never capable of any kind of language, basically a 6 month year old for 50 years until she passed away last July.  My grandma was a stay at home mom and took care of her 24/7.    I can tell you right now, if my grandma passed first. I would find the best home for her to live (with SSD payments) and would not even consider trying to take care of my aunt or paying for her.  No way would I sign up to care for someone 24/7.   All I can say is good luck and start googling for a care facility that will take your cousin for SSD payments.     Do not even attempt to pay this facility $5,500 a month (66,000 a year).  That is insane and not your legal obligation in any way."

Discovered mold all throughout our walls and HVAC after a water leak and the apartment complex has proceeded to threaten us, lie to us, gaslight us and try to force us into signing a NDA and a release. Texas We have been living in our apartment complex for just over a year. About 9 months ago I began to feel sick everyday. Constant nausea, headaches, lethargy, diarrhea, trouble breathing and random fever spikes. I have in the last few months had 5 covid-19 tests. I have seen multiple specialists that have thought it could be anything from Crohn's disease, MS, or even leukemia. All tests have came back negative and all I have ended up with instead of answers is medical debt. On top of that I have two cats who would get sick on and off throwing up, diarrhea, weezing and lethargy but it didn't even occur to me that it could be related at the time.  Fast forward to about a week and a half ago we wake up in the middle of the night to a foul smelling water leak coming out of our wall. We call the complex manager and they send a maintenance crew in the next day to open the wall and address the leak. None of these individuals were wearing masks. When they opened up the wall we discovered it was caked with mold with 5' standing sludge water at the base. It appears it has been a gray water leak that has gone on for months. Immediately once we realize the mold was so bad we told them that once they stopped the leak they needed to stop cutting into the wall immediately until we could have a mold specialist address the potential dangers. They ignored us and proceeded to blow an industrial grade fan into the wall in an attempt to dry the water. The whole time we're saying this is dangerous and should not be done this way. We call a mold specialist and he's appalled how they had went about it from a procedural standpoint and said it was reckless and dangerous to all parties involved. The apartment complex then says that we should just continue to stay there for the night or go stay with a friend. I am asthmatic and have it compromised immune system and I can't believe they just told us to go stay with a friend in the middle of a pandemic. They refused to offer to put us in a hotel. My boyfriend who I share the apartment with went to the office to show the complex manager the photos he had taken of the men working and to express his concern and she proceeded to tell him that it was illegal filming them and to delete the photos immediately. We looked it up and because we live in Texas which is a one-party consent state to record so that was just a blatant lie on her part. She later asked that we shared the photos with her. After numerous phone call exchanges where management continued to contradict themselves we have requested from now on that we only communicate via email. We requested that they hire a mold specialist to analyze the potential toxicity of the mold and they refused. So we paid out of our own pocket to have a specialist come in there and he said it was some of the worst he had ever seen. Lo and behold we get the results back and the amount of mold is off the charts. The particular strain that they found can cause edema, bronchial spasms , pulmonary emphysema as well as nausea and diarrhea. It was only after we told the complex that they said that they were having their own mold specialist going later that day. They have refused to let us see their results. At this point we strongly urge that they do not allow any cosmetic repairs to undergo in the apartment until proper mold remediation can happen. They don't respond to that email for 3 days and then on the third day send us an email saying that they are within their rights to terminate our lease since we are blocking them from doing necessary maintenance, and that if we don't come to a decision to either move into another apartment or terminate our lease contingent on us signing an NDA and a full release that they would be terminating our lease by 2:00 p.m. the next day. Effectively giving us less than 24 hours notice. I also want to mention that in Texas the governor has ruled evictions illegal until September 30th. We immediately reply and say we are not hindering them from doing repairs that we were only concerned for the safety of their crew and ourselves. They never responded to that. And every email where they bring up our options they present it as option A or option b and it's always contingent on the NDA and the full release. At this point we get the city code inspection involved and when we go to the apartment to meet the inspector we find a biohazard truck parked in front of our apartment and when my boyfriend goes in there to see what's going on he finds individuals in hazmat suits vacuuming all of our personal belongings. In one email she said the due to their inspection that they saw no reason why the apartment wouldn't be inhabitable, and a phone call shortly after she says due to the water damage the floor is not structurally sound and it's not safe for us to be in there.  My next email with her I ask if the apartment structurally sound for us to go in there to grab some personal belongings and she's in lies yet again and says that it was never an issue with its structural integrity even though that's precisely what she had said to a phone call that both my boyfriend and myself were on. She says that we cannot go into the apartment because they've had a cleaning crew in there that have used chemicals that would be unsafe for us to enter until Wednesday which she told us that on the previous Friday. If I had not emailed her we wouldn't have gotten any notification at all that this was happening and could have easily gone into that apartment unaware of the chemicals present. We have many emails of her consistently contradicting herself, and gaslighting us. The lack of professionalism and empathy they have treated us is shocking. We've tried reaching out to the tenant rights councils multiple times but due to covid-19 it's been incredibly difficult to get a hold of anyone. At this point we're ready to hire a lawyer. it's been suggested we find someone who specializes in personal injury as well as a familiarity with tenants rights and real estate. We have already spoken to a few that have said it's a clear-cut case of negligence and they wouldn't be surprised if our story ended up on the local news. It's been difficult for us since we both work full-time 9:00 to 5:00 jobs to get anything done and I'm so close to quitting my job so I can just focus on this.  I have already gone to see my doctor and explain the situation to him and when he listened to my lungs he was concerned and immediately sent me in to get an x-ray. He believes this is why I have been ill.  Any advice and recommendations on how to move forward would be greatly appreciated and if you have read your way through this post I am so very grateful  Sincerely, weezy mold grrl\n\nAssistant:"

Harassment has ensued - what do I do? I\u2019ll try to be as brief as possible and stick to the facts.  I moved into a new area at the end of last month. Specifically, I moved from Chicago to a small town outside of Charlotte, NC. This had been in the pipeline for several months as I was moving closer to be near family. Though I have made this move to be with family, I am living on my own.  I moved into a quiet, residential area. It\u2019s very suburbian, and there are not many solo residents in my age range (24 -39) living here. As a note, I am not African-American or of any other minority - I am a mid 20s white female.  Almost immediately, I met one of my neighbors, who began interrogating me on who I was, why I was there, where I had come from and what I was doing etc. This wasn\u2019t just a polite conversation, they were very clear in the fact that they did not believe that I belonged in the area. They asked me how I intended to pay my rent or mortgage since it did not appear like I had the means to based on the contents of my boxes, and very clearly pronounced that as a part of the local neighborhood watch, if anything were to happen in the near future then I would be their prime suspect. I brushed this all off as madness with a dash of being a jobsworth, and hoped to never hear from this person again.  About a week after I moved in, I received a visit from a local police officer. He said that he had been called because I had supposedly been acting suspiciously around the neighborhood, such as peering into front windows and loitering outside people\u2019s houses. The only time I had spent an extended period of time outside of my house was when I was tending to my front garden. I don\u2019t want to automatically declare that it was the neighbor I\u2019d originally met who had put the call in, but it highly likely that it was them. I invited the officer in to basically say that it was all lies because someone didn\u2019t like the cut of my jib.  An important point to make is that I am originally a British citizen. I came to America 7 years ago initially on a study visa, however quickly decided that I wanted to remain in America permanently. Through sponsorship from my first employer after graduating, I was able to gain my green card 3 years ago. In short, I am allowed to reside in the United States legally. Unsurprisingly, as soon as I started speaking, I was asked to prove my citizenship. I produced all of the relevant documentation, however almost immediately the officer said that he believed it was a forgery. He wouldn\u2019t go into detail about why he believed this, but I was told that what had initially been a cautionary visit to dissuade me from \u2018my actions\u2019 had become an investigation into me possessing forged documents. I compiled, mainly more out of shock than anything else, and went with the officer to the local station.  It became apparent very quickly that the officer had no leg to stand on. The first person I spoke to said that everything seemed legitimate, and joked that the officer who had brought me in was somewhat of an ICE-idoliser and was annoyed that the only crimes to happen in the area were petty thefts and the occasional incident of animal rustling. After another interview I was released with all of my documentation, and without any charge.  That happened about two weeks ago. My situation now is that it has become apparent that the police officer who I initially met actually lives in my neighborhood. I first realised this when I was outside the front of my house and he was driving up the road. He pulled over, and said that if he was on-duty he\u2019d arrest me for vandalising public property. I said that I was just in my garden, and he replied that I had no proof that I wasn\u2019t standing somewhere else in the neighborhood and being aggressive, and that he could produce witnesses faster than I could even imagine. 4 - 5 more instances like this have occurred if I have been visible to him in the past two weeks. I know that this must be some kind of police harassment, but currently he has not approached me at all while he has been on duty. Am I still able to somehow report this?\n\nAssistant:"

He did not hurt her or her two kids (ages 5 and 2.5) but physically destroyed several things around the house before she called the police. He was arrested and charged with domestic battery and destruction of property. There is currently a restraining order on him to stay away from her & the kids until his court hearing Monday.   I had no idea the extent of it because she kept it all from me (I live several states away so it wasn\u2019t all that difficult), but apparently his anger issues and destructive tendencies have been a reoccurring problem for basically their entire relationship (about 4 years). So this has not been a one-time incident, but rather hallmark DV over the course of several years.   Her husband has a gun (my sister thinks it\u2019s a Ruger 9mm but I don\u2019t know for sure) that my dad sold him within the state of Utah a couple years ago. According to my dad, no paperwork/registration was needed for a gun sale of that nature in the state of Utah. During the course of the DV, he would often threaten to shoot himself or harm himself with said gun. My sister told me she would hide it in various places around the house to keep him from getting to it, and would keep the ammo in a completely separate location from the gun. (I know how incredibly dangerous that is with two young kids, even if gun/ammo are separated. If I would have known...) She is incredibly fortunate (if that\u2019s even the word to use in this kind of situation) that no one has been seriously injured or hurt because of the gun [yet].  I know she needs to get the gun out of her house ASAP, but I also know that she needs to make sure it is 100% above the table and also won\u2019t have any repercussions on any future custody/divorce proceedings that could somehow weaken her case or chances at getting full custody of her child.   A few questions:  1. What\u2019s the best way to get rid of this gun? 2. Would there be any potential repercussions in divorce/legal proceedings if she sold a gun that was his?  3. Can she even sell it? Not having paperwork for a gun sale or not having to register it at all just seems really weird to me, but I know nothing about gun laws.  4. In the meantime, if she isn\u2019t able to get rid of it altogether, can she give it to a trusted friend for safekeeping until she can speak with a lawyer and figure out how to proceed?  He is a legal US resident but does not have citizenship (I don\u2019t know whether this affects anything, gun-wise or otherwise).\n\nAssistant:"

For some background I am renting an apartment and my lease ends on September 30th. My landlord is an older guy who inherited this house; not a professional company or anything like that. I do have a lease that says I get 24 hours notice for entry except emergencies which I believe is the law itself, but in this case I did not get that notice.  Last week my landlord texted me shortly after 8AM saying someone is interested in buying the house from him (he has not previously brought up selling it so this was unexpected). He asked if I could let them in to see the place at 10, and then at 9:30 texted again saying he's guessing I'm at work so he's just going to let them pick up a key from them and lock up when they are done looking.  I did not see these messages until I took lunch at 12. I texted my landlord back saying I thought I am supposed to get notice for entry and I'm not comfortable with him letting people in unattended, he said sorry but they are going out of town and won't be back for two weeks so it was an emergency (though I'm sure that doesn't legally count).  Long story short they robbed me and I have it on security video but police weren't able to get much information from it because their vehicle is common and has no license plate, and they wore hoods and bandanas so you can't tell much about their faces. They took everything of value such as laptop and TV and even some stupid things like my lamps.  My renter's insurance originally was going to cover it but said they need a copy of the police report, and the police report explains the situation that my landlord gave them a key (as opposed to them breaking in). Now the renter's insurance says they cover breaking and entering resulting in loss but these circumstances makes it a civil issue instead of an insurance issue and I should seek to get reimbursed for my losses by my landlord instead.  Meanwhile my landlord is an idiot and did not even know these people. He met them at Dennys, only got their first names and gave them his phone number and told them his own address to pick the key up, but didn't get any of their information whatsoever like phone number or anything. I told him my renter's insurance won't cover this and because this was caused by him literally giving strangers a key to the place I would like him to reimburse me for my losses, he says he's sorry but at the end of the day it's these guys that owe me and not him and offered to talk to the police more to give them more description to find the guys but that's all he can do to help.  What now? Push my renter's insurance, sue the landlord, give up and cry? I would appreciate any advice anyone might have on what my best option is at this point.\n\nAssistant:"

I ended up meeting a woman at that bar, she was drinking, we started talking, we ended back at my place, we had sex. We did not use protection, which was dumb. Afterwards we texted a little bit, and then things went cold and that's cool whatever.  Well about 6 weeks later she calls me, tells me she's pregnant. She wants to keep it, I think well...ok lets start planning how we are going handle this because I don't see a relationship, then she hits me with the fact that she is 17.  I asked her how she got into the bar, she said she used a fake id. Also at no point in our conversations did I ask her age. She did mention she was in a college, which turns out that's a lie too. I knew she was young, I didn't think she was 17 I figured she was maybe 21, 22? This whole age revelation really derailed the conversation.  A week later I get a call from her dad, who was furious at me. I tried explaining that she used a fake ID to get into a bar that was checking IDs. I also tried talking to the dad how we need to start discussing child support, etc. He said he was to see me rot in prison for having sex with a 17 year old.  My friends have been suggesting I get a lawyer, and I plan on calling a few...but what kind of lawyer would I call for this? Also...do I have any legal protections considering I met her in an establishment where her ID was checked, and she used a fake ID to enter and had she not done that I'd have never met her.

Advice needed--thinking of settling. I will probably consult with a lawyer in the near future. I understand that the title is vague but I was trying to keep triggering topics out of the title. I'm using mobile so there may be some formatting issues.   I have a daughter (13) with an ex who was not in her life. We were young, in our early 20s, when she was born. My ex wasn't ready to give up her life and be a mom yet so I assumed full custody. She had another child when our daughter was 9 and never spoke to our daughter again or really acknowledged her. I remarried as well and my wife has been an amazing stepmom to my daughter.   My daughter was diagnosed with cancer in 2016. I made sure to let my ex know of course and sent periodic updates. She didn't visit or call and basically things went on as normal.   In December 2019 it became apparent that her fight was drawing to a close and there was nothing anyone could do. I sent the following email (copy pasted text because I'm technologically illiterate, with private info removed):   \"Jess,  I want to let you know that we got the results of E's scan today. The cancer has spread significantly with several new growths and no change to the old sites.   At this time doctors are advising that treatment is unlikely to be successful and we would be better off providing her with comfort care instead. She will be a lot more comfortable and be allowed to go home which she really wants.   L, the doctors, and I have all talked to her as well as child life. She has agreed that it's time to come home. She is being discharged tomorrow to hospice at home.   As always, she would love to see/hear from you.\"   she replied to that email a short time later with \"thank you for the update\". She didn't call or reach out to our daughter at all.   After coming home from the hospital, my daughter asked me to mail a letter and to send an email she'd written to her mother. I don't know what the letter or email said but I know that neither one was replied to.   In January, our daughter passed away. I sent the following emails:  \"Jess,  I wish I didn't have to write this email. Our sweet E passed away in her sleep. It was very peaceful. I will send another email with funeral details.   Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.\"   and then the one about the funeral. I had to redact most of that one because it was full of personal information but this is the important part:  \"Jess,  In addition, we have decided on cremation. Please let me know if you would like any of her ashes. I can even get them made into jewelry or put in an urn for you and have it shipped if that's easier for you.\"  She replied to that one thanking me and telling me she would rather not have the ashes and that I could do what I liked with them.   We did. We gave some to my mother, had some turned into jewelry for my wife and three younger girls, I kept some and we buried some in a few of her favorite places. At this point the only ashes that physically exist are mine, my mother's, and my wife/daughters'.   Fast forward to the end of February and I get an email from her stating that she'd had a change of heart and asking if she could have some of our daughter's ashes.   I told her that unfortunately we didn't have any \"left\", but that my wife offered to send her the necklace she had made. She declined and did seem a little offended that we'd offered but it was all we had to give.   A few days ago I received notice that she was suing me for emotional damages for \"failing to offer her our shared child's cremains\" and \"offering a used necklace\" and some other nonsense.   I'm going to be honest: I feel like the only person who is being emotionally damaged here is me. I'm dealing with a huge devastating loss of my first child, my best buddy, my constant companion while also dealing with the stress of the pandemic/lockdown, two young kids who don't understand, AND a brand new baby (born end of March). I feel like I've been nothing but nice and communicative to her and this is what I get for it?   I'm angry, I'm tired, and I'm frustrated. Realistically, I don't even have the emotional energy to fight it and I'm seriously considering throwing some money at it and hoping it goes away. Is that the best solution?\n\nAssistant:"

I woke up to a message from her saying that I don\u2019t have her permission to have my boyfriend over once a week. And that if that happened she would call the police.  Nobody was over last night or even visiting.  I am willing to get a background check if that puts her mind at ease but she is adamant on me not having overnight guests. I only have my boyfriend over, no one else ever comes to visit.  There is nothing in the lease that states anything about overnight guests. \u201c The landlord and the tenant agree that the premises may be occupied by the tenant and their children, unless the landlord consents in writing to the occupation of the premises by some other or an additional person.\u201d This is verbatim from my lease. I googled the definition of occupant in regards to this issue and I am the sole occupant. He is my guest who stays over one night a week.  I asked her to show me in the lease where it says that, she did not provide me anything and just went on to say that they are her rules and they will have to be followed(she doesn\u2019t live here, she lives in a different city). I asked my roommate if she had any issues with my boyfriend coming over and she said that she did not have any problems whatsoever.  She went on to say that this is a female only basement and that I can\u2019t have him stay the night. She said if he stays the night she will call the police. She has met my boyfriend several times over the last year and is always so nice to us so I don\u2019t know what happened.  I asked her to show me the written rules and again she said I either follow her rules or find another place.  She never gives a 24 hour notice before coming because she has a room in which she keeps some old stuff. She just calls and asks to me open the door. This one time I woke up to commotion and when I went out, she and 2 other people(who I don\u2019t know) were grabbing the sofa from the living room.(it is a furnished house and all the furniture in the house is hers). When I went out of the room to see what was happening, she said oh I thought you weren\u2019t home. Also another time one of her friends just opened the lock and came in and took some stuff. When I brought this up to her during the argument she said that she did not want to discuss this matter further.  I was extremely polite but firm in my responses, so that she couldn\u2019t twist my words into serving me a notice to eviction the grounds of harassment. But she just says that she wants to keep this rule strictly enforced or I can find another place. I don\u2019t know what is going to happen . My boyfriend is going to get a background check first thing on Monday. I only have 7 more months of my lease left and then I\u2019ll leave. I told her that this is causing me distress and she is harassing me for no reason. I have not broken the law or any terms in the lease. I am currently not responding to her messages but she is texting me that she will call the police and evict me.  I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. I just need some advice.\n\nAssistant:"

Her direct supervisor is in his 40's.  He had been sending her non-work related texts for months.  She eventually became uncomfortable and I told her to only communicate with him regarding work related issues.  In December, he asked her out via text.  Specifically, he asked her to go golfing and have lunch with him on a weekend.  She turned him down and told my husband and I about it right away.  I told her that she should bring this to the next level of management and to request that her position be changed so that she is no longer working under him.  My daughter did this and the manager escalated the issue to HR, as I would expect.  HR immediately put my daughter on paid leave for two weeks so that they could investigate and make a decision.  My daughter supplied them with all of the text conversations.  After about 3 or 4 weeks, they had her come in and talk to HR and upper level management.  The upper level manager told her \"you don't understand the world of golf. It is not unusual for an older man to golf with a younger girl\".  He essentially made her feel like she took everything out of context and what happened was like a coach working with a student athlete.  My daughter is not a student athlete, she has never golfed, and this man is not her coach.  I have always told her to trust her gut in situations like this and I firmly believe this was more than just a man wanting to teach a young girl to play golf.  It is absurd that the manager even suggested this.  My daughter is not an idiot.  Her supervisor is the man who makes her schedule, sets her hours, sets her rate of pay, and has the power to fire her.  He should have NEVER put her in the position where she felt uncomfortable saying no to a request for something that is not work related.  Not an underage girl.  Thankfully, for their sake, she had the good sense to say no!  It has been several weeks since she first reported him.  They have told her they have not made a decision yet and that she is welcome to come back to work while they work on making their decision, but they will hold her position if she doesn't feel comfortable.  She is no longer getting paid.  Is there anything we can do or is it just time to move on?  She is saving for college in the fall, so she needs to work.  My instinct tells me it's time to move on. She will never feel comfortable there now that management has made her feel the way she does, but it kills me that she is the one who will suffer when she did nothing wrong.  Any advice is appreciated.  Edit: I should note the non-work related texts had gone on for months before he asked her out.  He also asked her to send him photos of herself so that he could add them to his contacts on his phone.  Just inappropriate messages from the start.\n\nAssistant:"
