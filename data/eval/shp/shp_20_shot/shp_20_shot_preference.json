    "\n\nHuman: Masters in one field while doing a PhD in another I know, title sounds crazy, because it is.   So at the moment I am a PhD student in physics, 1st year in the US (MA) and will definitely stay on this track. But, I also really enjoy mathematics, and it helps me every single time I know an entire structure of math, not just one particular theorem from some field I have never heard of, but can be applied to physics.  So I love math enough that I would be willing to do a Masters work in it while doing research for my PhD in physics (by the way, I am in theory). But the catch is how to get around, or convince the graduate school to let me do this.  Every course I take in the math department would help me in my research in physics and knowledge. I would have taken enough courses to earn myself a Masters in mathematics, and I kind of what that piece of paper since I might want to teach not just physics but math also in the future.   My guess for letting the graduate school let me do this (since the math department has no issue) is that I would **not** accept my Masters in physics, and go straight to the PhD, therefore \"substituting\" one Masters for another. I was wondering if there is anything else (like arguments) I could use to reinforce this, or just in general if this even makes sense to do. (I should not, even if I can't get the Masters in math, I will still be taking courses, they are too important).   Thanks.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Supervisor seems like he wants to delay my graduation OK this is part rant, part asking for advice.  My relationship with my supervisor was always a little tense. He never gave useful input but I actually loved that because then I was able to do my own work and write papers I would be interested in. Due to coronavirus shutdown, I accelerated progress and was able to write 3 papers in 2020 and basically am on my way out.   One of our submissions was just returned with request for major revisions due in 15 days. I asked immediately for a meeting, which he ignored and even told me to not use lab resources to make room for other people. Luckily his input is worthless anyway and I am almost done with the revisions.   The problem is he wants me to work for him as much as possible in the lab as well as for his company. I said I don't want to pursue this field and will do something else and while I think he got the message, he now seems to think if he can't benefit off me (he once told me verbatim \"he will milk me as much as he can\" LOL), he has no problem extending my stay.   I will quit if I don't graduate by this summer (I wrote a first draft for my thesis and surprise, he hasn't read it). It may sound stupid and dramatic, but I need money (my family needs support + I just bought an expensive computer thinking I would be out in a few months). I don't want to give an ultimatum because at worst he'll have someone else carry on the last mile and publish those papers + even if not, he is a tenured professor who is in his 60s, doesn't give a shit.   What do I do?   \\--------------  Some other gems:  \\- When my first paper was submitted, he told me it needs more work and probably will be rejected. When it got into a really good journal, he was shocked and visibly upset (cause we need only 3 papers)  \\- We discussed me leaving before and even though I had 2 conference + 1 journal + 2 in review, he said what's the rush? He was so happy to pay me $25k/year when an engineer at that level asks for $200k+/year for a starting salary. Mentioned it a bunch of times.  \\- His instincts are terrible. Every time I get a note \"add this\" or \"remove that\", we get feedback saying this is unrelated or why didn't you describe this in detail. I don't think he is sabotaging me here, it's more like he takes about 15 minutes to review the work and just wants to say things.  \\- Since I completed my thesis and every single requirement, I asked him if I could work full time (or even part time). He said no way, people never finish their thesis if they work because they underestimate the work required to complete (exam, revising thesis etc). Now I'm sitting here and before this rejection/rebuttal had nothing to do. But he found me work: I help some of the newcomers, comment my code and prepare documents for future use. I don't object to these, even though in my last 4 years this type of work never amounted to anything.\n\nAssistant:": {

In this case, it should be caught up in peer review and if it isn't, you can issue an Errata. That's my \"Devil's advocate\" take on this.",
            " I\u2019ve been in a somewhat similar situation in the past where a PI told me in person to do unethical conduct.  I definitely agree that if all you have is your word, don\u2019t report it yet. The PI will just say you\u2019re lying or misunderstood and you won\u2019t get anywhere.  Think hard about what you would want to get out of reporting, and what costs you are willing to pay. Losing your career is always a possibility when going up against a supervisor.  My strategy was generally to write an email where I would essentially put my supervisor in a corner to agree that I should actually behave ethically. So like, if my PI in person said \u201cwe need this data completed in four weeks, so do unethical thing X\u201d. My email might say, \u201cHi PI, I was making my plans based on our meeting. I know you said we want data completed in four weeks. Obviously I have to do (ethical thing), so on reflection, I don\u2019t see a way to make the four week goal. Perhaps we could instead (do ethical thing - say maybe complete data in eight weeks)?\u201d  This does a few things: it puts in writing that doing the unethical thing is bad, so your PI knows you are unwilling to be unethical for them. It pushes your PI to either change what they are asking, or respond *in writing* asking you to do the unethical thing. (Of course they can just talk more in person? But then it\u2019s weird to not respond to the email.) It sort of hints to your PI that you are getting things in writing, and so maybe they should be more careful about not asking you to do unethical things, because maybe you might try to report them.  Every time I did this, my PI changed what he was asking and was willing to do the ethical route. It did make our relationship more strained / tense? But I was able to manage it and move on to the next stage of my career, with a reasonably good recommendation from my PI.  If you can, it might also be good to confide in someone you trust who is familiar with your situation- another student, or a past supervisor. That will provide you with some backup if you need it later, and they also might be able to give better advice about how to handle your particular situation than us strangers on the internet.",

    "\n\nHuman: I think I need to quit my PhD. How can I do this respectfully and professionally? I am currently a first year PhD student and I think I need to quit my program. When I got to my senior year of undergrad I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. In a panic I applied to grad schools and somehow got accepted. I have no real research experience and had no idea what I was getting into.   In my first year my grades have been good and my PI is happy with my performance. However,  I\u2019m extremely unhappy. I dread going into the lab, I generally dislike the people I work with, and I just can\u2019t see myself doing this 10 years from now. I have no motivation to do work and that is something I\u2019ve never experienced before.  I sleep for a minimum of 10 hours at a time and I don\u2019t feel rested. I think I\u2019m becoming depressed, I feel myself beginning to slip and I need to leave.  How can I do this without burning bridges? I respect the hell out of  my PI, but this isn\u2019t for me. Any advice would help.   Thanks for reading.\n\nAssistant:": {

The third year review committee lays it out for those who are in danger- either get it together or get out essentially.  those people typically stay for year 4 while they are job searching elsewhere, and do end up landing other academic gigs.

    "\n\nHuman: New research suggests that metrics that are used to measure academic success, such as the number of publications, number of citations, and impact factor, have become targets and follow Goodhart\u2019s Law, according to which, \u201cwhen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\u201d The original study can be found here: https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/6/giz053/5506490  Abstract:  **Background**  > The academic publishing world is changing significantly, with ever-growing numbers of publications each year and shifting publishing patterns. However, the metrics used to measure academic success, such as the number of publications, citation number, and impact factor, have not changed for decades. Moreover, recent studies indicate that these metrics have become targets and follow Goodhart\u2019s Law, according to which, \u201cwhen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\u201d  **Results**  > In this study, we analyzed >120 million papers to examine how the academic publishing world has evolved over the last century, with a deeper look into the specific field of biology. Our study shows that the validity of citation-based measures is being compromised and their usefulness is lessening. In particular, the number of publications has ceased to be a good metric as a result of longer author lists, shorter papers, and surging publication numbers. Citation-based metrics, such citation number and h-index, are likewise affected by the flood of papers, self-citations, and lengthy reference lists. Measures such as a journal\u2019s impact factor have also ceased to be good metrics due to the soaring numbers of papers that are published in top journals, particularly from the same pool of authors. Moreover, by analyzing properties of >2,600 research fields, we observed that citation-based metrics are not beneficial for comparing researchers in different fields, or even in the same department.  **Conclusions**  > Academic publishing has changed considerably; now we need to reconsider how we measure success.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Is it normal to become more convinced your discipline is detached from practical reality the more you study it? I know this might read as a trollish post, but I *promise* I'm serious.  So, I'm currently halfway through my Adv. MSc. International Relations & Diplomacy, and while my undergrad was a Liberal Arts BA, that was also heavily IR-focused. Honestly? I love it, but only in the context of academic bickering about pointless minutae that do not matter outside the walls of the faculty - the more I've studied IR theories, the less my remarks of \"we're a humanities field trying to masquerade as a hard science\" and \"if you open the dictionary to 'Ivory Tower Academia' you'll find a picture of our faculty\" have become jokes. I know there's always going to be a difference between academic theory and practices in reality - you clearly *need* to perform abstractions when creating a theory, but several of the main theories in my field just feel like they fall apart at the first dose of being exposed to the outside. I've always had this feeling to some extent, but it's grown rather than diminished, and I'm now actually worried whether or not I'll be able to put any conviction whatsoever in my master's thesis next year.  Is this just a natural side effect of learning more about your field's theoretical frameworks and therefore being exposed to case studies where they *don't* work more, or am I just seriously disillusioned/too cynical?  TL;DR starting to feel like my entire field desperately needs to go touch grass and talk to people, is that normal?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: r/askacademia, let's talk - academic life and mental health issues? Hello r/askacademia...I'm a recent phd graduate, and I'm very concerned about academic life and mental health in general.   Two people who were very close to me (my advisor and a friend in academia) have both committed suicide in the past few years. I know a number of other very intelligent, talented academics who have had suicide attempts, inpatient stints, on and off a number of medications for depression, etc.  Now, of course, I'm not so naive to think that these issues are exclusive to just the academic world - BUT - I'm wondering if there's a higher prevalence of these issues, and if that's related to: the type of people academia attracts, the pressure of the academic workload and life, or a combination of these, or other factors.  The reason I'm posing this question is that it seems like a quiet storm that nobody wants to openly discuss and address, which is very upsetting considering that people I love are dead, or have almost died.  Seeing what I've seen, I'm reluctant to continue down an academic career path.   r/askacademia - what do you think? Have you had similar experiences/observations?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " I'm really sorry about your advisor and your friend.  It is tough out there/here. As others have pointed out, academia can be isolating and highly competitive. The pressure to ace exams, publish papers, get grants, etc. can be suffocating. I struggled in my program for a long time - in the early years, it was a bad advisor situation, and I gained a lot of weight, slept all the time (like three-hour naps every day), wore nothing but sweatpants, cried every damn day, thought about dropping out... Then another prof overheard me talking about leaving and stepped in. I started working for her and things improved a lot.  The other really rough period was while I was writing my dissertation. I was doing interviews that were reaaally emotionally taxing and transcribing them all myself, so I would pretty much wake up, sit down at my computer, put headphones on and transcribe details of homelessness, sexual abuse, domestic violence, etc for eight hours straight. I was also on the job market and not having much luck, which made me feel inadequate and that all my hard work was for nothing. My spouse was in exactly the same situation, so things were tense at home, AND I found out that my mother and sister would be moving overseas, which was devastating for me. This dark time cleared up as 1) winter passed, 2) the dissertation came together and turned out really well, and 3) we landed jobs together. I also saw a counselor at the campus clinic to help me through. She was wonderful.  I have just finished my first year on the job. In some ways it was really difficult, like the dissertation period, but I feel like I have more resources to cope. Not gonna lie, having more money helps! I started seeing a personal trainer 2x a week, which has been great for my physical and mental health. I've had some publishing success, and getting my research started in our new area has kept me busy and distracted. I started hiking and geocaching to get me outside in the sun and fresh air.  Sometimes I feel guilty that I spend time exercising and doing other recreational things instead of working more, but I realize that working all the time would NOT make me more productive, because I would be miserable and burned out. I am most productive when I make time in my day for exercising and relaxing - having that time off allows me to spend my work hours *working* instead of, uh, crying and hating life.",

    "\n\nHuman: Handling a bossy/micromanaging colleague (postdoc) Hi!  I am looking for some advice on an interpersonal issue I am having.  I am a second-year postdoc assigned to work on a continuing project. A Ph.D. student and another postdoc have been working on this project. I was given a new but connected part to work on by our PI.   The issue I am having is with this other postdoc on this project. Specifically, this other postdoc sees himself at a higher rank than me (i.e., the project manager), despite us being both postdocs. This could be because this is a continuation of his Ph.D. work (6 years Ph.D. + 1-year postdoc) or because he has been at the same lab for seven years. I find this \u201cmanager behavior\u201d problematic (specifics below). Before I continue, note that I am very receptive to **technical** feedback on my work, which is NOT the issue here.  Examples of this problematic \u201cmanager\u201d behavior are:  * Tries to set my weekly deadlines and tasks for me.     * Example: I was considering learning a simulation tool. He asked me to contact other people who used the tool and ask them, \u201cHow long did it take them to learn it?\u201d The purpose of this question is to set a deadline for me. * Always asking: How long is this going to take you? He sends emails and checks up on me constantly, always starting with \u201chave you had the chance to finish \\[insert task\\].\u201d  * Pushing for a plan: He wants me to write all my tasks for this project and how long each task will take.    * I suspect he will present this plan to our industrial collaborators himself as: \u201cHere is what my team will do.\u201d    * I do not like these plans as each task in my research takes varying lengths of time depending on complexity, which I cannot estimate. I do not see the point. I feel like this plan will be used later as \"Gotcha! You are late doing this!\".   * At some point, he changed pronouns from \u201cI\u201d to \u201cwe\u201d in my slides to be presented to our industrial collaborators, where I talked about my progress. He did not contribute to that work and made it seem like that work was a group effort. * Very pushy in deciding how things on MY part should be done. * Creates a sense of panic and rush (This project is on a short deadline, but still, the behavior is too much).  * Generally, being a micromanager.   Again, we are both at the identical rank.   I want to be left alone and not deal with this behavior. He is not my manager, and I handle my tasks in a certain way, and this behavior affects my productivity. Having weekly meetings where I present my work and receive feedback is fine with me and is appreciated, but none of this other BS he is doing.  I have been trying to push back by arguing my points and explaining that I disagree with his approach, but he is relentless and getting on my nerves.  Final note: Our PI is absent and likely does not want to be involved. The PI never indicated that I should report to this other postdoc. So this behavior is unwarranted from what I can tell.   **Question**: How do I deal with this? I have been trying to remain calm, but it is getting challenging, affecting my productivity as I am constantly angry and frustrated with his behavior. I am afraid I will have to confront him and put him in his place, but I would like to leave that as a last resort and try to resolve this amicably.\n\nAssistant:": {

For context, I'm coming at this from the perspective of someone working in particle physics, an inherently collaborative field, and so people having interconnected work (and as such requiring cooperation on timelines and outputs) is a given. And we're not that hung up on rank; if a PhD student is leading work and they need something from a postdoc, for example, the postdoc isn't going to get het up by the student trying to get updates/a timeline on that work.  With regards to this:  > Specifically, this other postdoc sees himself at a higher rank than me (i.e., the project manager), despite us being both postdocs. This could be because this is a continuation of his Ph.D. work (6 years Ph.D. + 1-year postdoc) or because he has been at the same lab for seven years.  I think you're getting way too caught up on \"rank\" here. Yes, you might both have the same job title and pay grade, but think instead of your positions *functionally* with regards to the project. He might not be the project manager, but I think we need to acknowledge that he has been working on this project a lot longer than you, and if you (as you say) have a largely absent PI, then that is the role he will have naturally performed. You have been given a connected piece of work to this project he has been working on for a much longer time, and if his work is in any way dependent on your work, then it is perfectly reasonable that he would want to know how long your work will take.  Now my clear caveat to that point is if absolutely nothing you do impacts his work then he has no grounds to do that, but from what you've written it sounds like your tasks are interconnected and your working group is on a pretty short deadline.  If that caveat does not apply though, I think it is perfectly reasonable for him to want an idea of your timelines. It is entirely possible that he is going about asking for this information in an unreasonable way.

I do not see the point. I feel like this plan will be used later as \"Gotcha! You are late doing this!\".  So the \"here is what my team will do\" is entirely supposition on your part, and isn't a fair reason not to give a plan. And it is entirely reasonable to want to have a plan for a project that is working to a short deadline. Your argument not to give any estimates is not a good one. Yes, things can take varying amounts of time, but you should at least be able to give a rough estimate. It speaks to a lack of experience/care that you cannot. You can't possibly plan a project with zero idea of how long things will take. This is why project managers love their gantt charts, because without a plan things can easily fall apart.  > I want to be left alone and not deal with this behavior.   But you work in a team that is doing a shared project. That will never be possible.  > I have been trying to push back by arguing my points and explaining that I disagree with his approach, but he is relentless and getting on my nerves.  The issue with that is you're assuming his approach is the (only) wrong one. Having read your post I think you're both in the wrong. He is clearly being pushy in his approach to querying your work, but you're so hung up on \"rank\" that you're ignoring the very good reasons he might have for doing so, and you seem unwilling to commit to timelines on a project where there are short deadlines. And if you consistently do so, I could see why he'd just push harder to try and get a timeline.  -------------------------------------------------------------------  On to practical advice:  Arrange a meeting with him, say that you want to discuss the project milestones and timelines. Get both of you on the same page about what needs to be done and when. Figure out which parts of the work are dependent on others, and negotiate fair lead times to get these things done. Turn this into a partnership, so that you both have ownership of how the project is managed. You can absolutely make the point that you don't feel comfortable being told how to do something without having asked. And that you don't want to feel like he is trying to micromanage your time.   But at the same time, you need to recognise that in a shared project, the time you take to do things does impact other people, and you can't take a laissez faire attitude to providing estimates. You need to be able to say how long things will take so that people have reasonable expectations and they can plan around your work.

            " First of all, humans are terrible practical epidemiologists. Unless something is so toxic that it kills the majority of people who ingest / use it so quickly that there can be no mistaking the cause, we generally don't do a very good job picking up on those patterns.   And it's not as if we're any better at that today. We're not figuring these things out ourselves. We rely on large medical studies over years to figure them out for us.  You mention lead.  We *still* have lead pipes in municipal water systems. Lead as an additive in paint is less than 100 years old. Lead in gasoline was used up into the mid-90s. Literally according to the statistics I'm slightly dumber than I could have been because I was born in the 70s when lead gasoline burning was near its peak. We only recently became aware of the true cost of lead in our environment.   Or how about asbestos filters for cigarettes? Or cigarettes, for that matter?  What about the wide variety of food additives that we keep having to remove because studies are finding them to be toxic?  BPA in water bottles? Potassium bromate in bread. Accumulating plastic particles in our bodies? Teflon?  Did you or I discover that these were problematic? Of course not.  The only phrase I can really find in my head to describe this post is \"modern, unearned smugness.\"  Yes, it irritates me. And it irritates me because in the modern media environment, when we see recall after recall, warning after warning, about things that we eat regularly, it smacks of a total lack of critical thinking.  Basically your post implicates ancient people with far less understanding of chemistry and biology than you have literally at your fingertips as ignorant for not figuring out that lead-- which acts as a sweetener-- causes developmental issues over one's lifetime, while simultaneously drinking Mountain Dew with high fructose corn syrup and Yellow 5 in it, or doing something else we'll find out in five years is equally bad for you.  >**Could we not figure it out through trial and error, like we did with most of the plant kingdom? Or did we know but just not care about the slow toxic buildup, because these were abundant sources of calories and flavour?**  Imagine someone posting this in 100 years about all the shit we all eat today that's killing us. Did you figure out through trial and error that BPA was bad?"

            " It\u2019s kind of hard to draw a clear border between what\u2019s functional and what\u2019s also esthetic. Humans have been making tools for millions of years, and for a long time many of these tools have had flourishes beyond the purely functional. Especially since the appearance of *Homo erectus* and the development of the Acheulian hand axe, you can see lots of examples of \"finesse\", as in maintaining symmetry and clean lines which weren\u2019t always functional, but did increase the visual appeal in ways we can recognize even today. Other more obvious examples include extreme sizes (making the tool too large or too small to be very useful), which we might interpret as a display of the toolmaker\u2019s art rather than serving a practical purpose.   Another aspect might be \"decorations\" made to functional objects, or even to non-functional or art objects. There are stones with hatched patterns and geometrical shapes scratched into them found at Blombos Cave in South Africa at 75,000 years. There are \"beads\" made of pierced shells, which may have been strung into a necklace at some point also at Blombos and at even earlier Aterian sites in North Africa at 110,000 years. There is plenty of ocher work with similar geometric patterns at the same dates, often on flat pieces of stone or rock walls, that don\u2019t have any functional use. It depends on interpretation. You might not call these \"art\" and we don\u2019t have any means to get into the minds or motivations of their makers, but it does fit into your question about effort expended into something without a utilitarian purpose, perhaps because the makers found it \"pretty\" or worth having or holding for its own sake.   Such \"artwork\" may extend beyond our own species. There are examples of similar geometric designs etched by Neanderthals, including hand prints outlined in ocher. And beyond that, we have examples of 500,000 year old shells etched with zig zag patterns (probably with the point of a shark\u2019s tooth) in Indonesia, that could only have been the work of *Homo erectus*. Again, we don\u2019t know why they were made, was it idle doodling, did the maker find the pattern appealing, did he carry the etched shell around or discard it.   The earliest representational art is probably the Venus figurines associated with the Aurignacian. The Hohle Fels Venus is 40,000+ years old, and a few others have been dated to the same period. There are bird bones with holes drilled in them that could have been used as a flute to make music, from the same period. And a bit later, we have cave paintings.   I think it\u2019s just a feature of the human brain. We can argue about when and why people began making stuff because it looked pretty rather than for any functional use, and we\u2019d probably get hung up on what\u2019s art or not and exactly where the borderline is between the utilitarian and the esthetic. It\u2019s difficult to recognize what may have appealed as \"pretty\" to someone who lived such a long time ago. But I think that the capacity to create and appreciate objects that have a visual or tactile appeal is just part of being human, and has been around for as long as our species has existed, and perhaps longer."

Adams and Mt. Hood (They both have different names in the various local languages, so I'm keeping it simple and using their contemporary Anglo names).  Mssrs Lewis and Clark didn't necessarily know what to make of such tales, but come to find out, some 200 years later, geologists and hydrologists have definitively affirmed that such a thing did in fact occur; that there was once a giant sort of natural bridge across the Columbia Gorge, that there was a massive Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake roughly 150 years prior to the L and C Expedition, and that said massive earthquake definitely caused the collapse of said giant natural bridge, which is kind of a shame, since it must have been one of the great natural wonders of the world when it existed.",

There are a number of reasons that skin colour and altitude are correlated, but there are two mains ones. #1 Melanin protects the skin from heavy sun exposure and prevents the destruction of some vital light sensitive nutrients (e.g. Folate). #2 Melanin blocks sunlight which is necessary for vitamin D synthesis - in areas with low sunlight having darker skin increases the risk of vitamin D deficiency and rickets.  I can't comment on your the specific populations you used as examples. However, in general, skin colour does not exactly correlate to latitude for a number of reasons.  1) Similar latitudes do not necessarily have similar UV exposure. There might, for example, be differences in cloud cover. Or less protection from the ozone layer. I'm no expert on this, but UV lines are a little wobbly!  **2)** Population migration - quite simply, those populations who have migrated more recently are less likely to match up to the expected level of skin reflectance and skin colouration. After 10-20,000 people seem to conform to expected skin reflectivity values - but humans are a lot more antsy than that! Migration seems to account for most outliers.  3) Skin colour is plastic and changes with sun exposure - one population where most people have jobs indoors will likely have a lighter average skin colour than a similar population who often work outside... or take long holidays in the bahamas. Tanning!!  4) There is more to skin colour than just melenin. All sorts of things can affect skin colour - to pick just one example, the number of capillaries on the skins surface can have a marked effect. I know less about this, but two skins of somewhat different hues may have similar melenin levels and, thus, be equality efficient at protecting against UV.

I quicked my studies of anthropology last year mostly because I didn\u2019t understand concretely the utility of this discipline. But now and ever since, I keep thinking about anthropology, reading and listening, and I am still eager to do anthropology.  I want to be useful for others and for the society but I can not figure out how I can use anthropology for that.  How can I use anthropology to give happiness to people, to do things concretely and to bring something to others.  Still I have the instinct that anthropology is the way, that I can do something with it but maybe you could help me to have a better understanding of this feeling...  Maybe you folks had already thought about it and had to deal with the same issue...I would be glad if you help me in my search... Because not only I don't deeply understand anthropology but this means also that I don't understand deeply myself, my desire and my utility.  PS : sorry for the english that is not perfect...\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Do we have a theory of what propelled certain cultures to develop technologically while others are stagnant? What I mean is that, let's say, Amazonian tribes, Australian aboriginals or some African hunter gatherers have lived roughly the same for thousands of years and I'd imagine they'd continue to do so if left alone.  But that makes me wonder, why didn't these cultures make the jump that the Mesopotamian civilisations or the Chinese in the Yellow river (among others) made? Is it random chance? Abundance of some resource? Weather?  Going back to the cultures I alluded to before, is it reasonable to expect them to remain mostly unchanged or would we expect them to eventually start their own bronze ages (again, if left alone, so in some hypothetical scenario where the other technologically advanced cultures didn't exist or didn't intervene in any way)?\n\nAssistant:": {

Most things reach a terminal point of advancement.  This can also be seen in things like smart phone technology-the rate of change was furious 2008-2012.  Now it is slowing down.

            " So this post is assuming something like an evolutionary or phase view of culture which has been out-of-date among anthropologists for 100 years now. Hunter-gatherers have changed tremendously over time. After the megafauna die on a continent you need to switch to hunting small game instead.

There's evidence that much of the Amazon was a cultivated food forest, though with the devastation of disease and colonization much of these practices were abandoned.

        "sft_target": " I'm not an anthropologist but a historian, and this is a question I see come up a lot in undergrad seminar classes and the like, so if I may I will post here what I usually tell my students.  Technology is problem solving. Problems can be complex, and can be immediate and physical, or can be projections of cultural value. One culture might see reliable river transportation as a problem to be solved, and another may not. One culture might derive value from the commodification of resources and another might derive value in largesse and sharing: both of those cultures will solve the knock-on problems of those value judgements very differently. So if one culture develops industrial capitalism as a result and another develops potlatching, they can't be judged in the same way, because ultimately they're expressions of a totally different set of problems to be solved.   Like another poster mentioned, a lot of seemingly simple solutions to common problems are technology. Birchbark or dugout canoes are technology. Trap building is technology. Enthnogeography is technology. Social hierarchies built around trade and hunting are technology.   If we look at technology only as the stuff that created ocean sailing vessels or spaceships, then we're falling into the trap created by enlightenment and imperialist thinkers that were asking the question \"why did white people win history\" instead of \"how did cultures perceive their needs and solve their problems related to those needs.\"",

Hunter-gatherers have changed tremendously over time. After the megafauna die on a continent you need to switch to hunting small game instead.

    "\n\nHuman: Chances of becoming an Anthropologist? Alternative opportunities? Is it possible or a pipe dream? Anthropology has fascinated me since I was 8 years old. I\u2019m in college and I just don\u2019t know what to do with my life. I feel like I was cursed with a passion for this field because the chances of going into it are so incredibly low, it seems. At least that\u2019s what I\u2019m always hearing.   There is quite literally nothing else in the world that I want to do. I\u2019m not good at anything besides things related to anthropology. I tried out computer science classes thinking I\u2019d do that because the job security is high, but I hate it AND I\u2019m not good at it. I want to go into anthropology.  If I were to pursue all the way up to a PhD, how good would my chances be at getting a job in the field? Are there other ways to get into field jobs other than research opportunities at universities?   If the reality is that it just wouldn\u2019t be possible for me to do what I love, I\u2019ve also considered a BA in Anthropology with a MA in Art History to become a museum curator, but those job prospects are also low. In addition to that, I wouldn\u2019t want to curate unethically sourced (stolen) pieces. And people speak about both options as if they\u2019re impossible anyway.  At this point it seems easier to become anything other than an Anthropologist. I\u2019m just feeling like there\u2019s no way in, and down about the real possibility I may never be happy in life because I can\u2019t pursue what I love.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Where/when did people get the notion that gods/a God demands sacrifice? I'm curious about where, how long ago, and why ancient humans got the notion that gods (or eventually, a God) wanted sacrifices, whether they be plants, animals, or human beings. By definition, a god would be all powerful, but why would that god demand the destruction of something precious as appeasement for some anger?  I don't subscribe to the idea that ancient cultures were necessarily \"primitive\" in an intellectual sense, so I don't see belief that a god wants a sacrifice as a primitive idea. This is supported by the fact that people still believe it today. (!) If your god loves you, why would that god want you to kill something? Your human father wouldn't ask you to kill your puppy to prove your love, right? (Ok, I'm digressing...) This is a complicated question posed in a space the size of a matchbook cover--hehe. Any thoughts on this? Any books that might help me understand this better? Many thanks.\n\nAssistant:": {

It's also not really possible to rule out simple cannibalism.  As for animal sacrifices, it's also difficult to say. There are animal bones in many Paleolithic burials, but it's not possible to divine whether the animal was sacrificed to be put in the grave or the bones were deposited for some other reason.

Some all powerful father figure who loves them unconditionally. Thats not how polytheistic religions, or even early monotheistic religions viewed their gods, like at all.   Most ancient gods honestly didn't give a shit about humans. Look at ancient mythology and humans are depicted more as a mistake or a curiosity to the gods than as children to be loved and groomed and cared for. The gods weren't nice, they weren't kind they were fearful awesome things that had their own lives and issues (seriously look to the greek gods or babylonian mythos to see how true that one is).   The only reason ancient gods gave any shit about humans was to play games with them (even the bible has the story of Job which can basically be summed up as the story of God and his drinking buddy the Devil take a bet that the Devil can fuck with this dude's life enough to get him to stop loving God, and God's response is \"go ahead I have that dude so whipped nothing you could do will change him\"). So a sacrifice in their honor was a way to appease these wrathful and often vain and greedy deities. In a religion with sacrifice you didn't sacrifice the whole animal, you would sacrifice the best and most desirable parts of the animal, and then either the priests, the community or your family got to keep the rest. It was a way of inviting the god into, and then bribing the god to take interest and take part in your community (since you know you don't normally want to harm people giving you free good food).  Gods weren't things to be loved, they were things to be feared and respected.  And you can partially look at that in relation to the environments and conditions these religions evolved in. The Babylonians are a really good example of this when compared to the Egyptians. Though both pantheons are rather dysfunctional in ways they are markedly different in that the Babylonian gods are basically the cause of all the problems in the stories while the egyptian gods are far more pacific by any stretch and mostly keep to themselves. In many ways this is similar to the environments the cultures are in. The Nile is an incredibly predictable river in how an when it floods, and the environment is fairly stable. The Tigris and Euphrates where the Babylonians on the other hand flooded unpredictably in both how high they flood and when. So for the people who lived around these rivers the gods who can be seen as representations of natural forces. So for the Egyptians their religion was strict and needed, but fair and predictable; for the Babylonians the gods were pretty much just unpredictable forces that must be appeased.  That sort of HBE approch to religion can also describe how religion today has shaped and changed, today's world is far more predictable and good to live in for it's populace, so gods tend to be seen more loving and caring rather than awesome and awful."

            " You are correct in recognizing some significant overlap, but it's possible to be more specific.  Cultural Anthropology and *cultural* sociology have significant overlap, but - and perhaps this might clarify things - cultural anthropology and the sociology *of culture* do not necessarily have as much overlap.  u/black_elk_streaks makes a good point but didn't quite get it right. Lots of cultural sociologists today use ethnography. although black elk streaks (not sure if i love that name...) are not entirely wrong, you are more likely to find ethnography used among cultural anthropologists than you are among sociologists at large (but these are not two entirely comparable categories. as cultural anth is a subdiscipline, whereas sociology is a full discipline). but nevertheless, you are indeed 100% much more likely to find quantitative methods and the use of large data sets in sociology than anthropology.  However, it was not always like this. In the earliest days of each discipline they sort of occupied inverse roles. Anthropologists were doing things like quantitative research on people's skull sizes and the incidence of certain family structures, whereas early sociologists like Durkheim to William Foote Whyte were more interested in using qualitative data.  In short, the forthcoming may seem like a cop out of an answer but one take away for you is that there are not necessarily inherent differences, but differences are largely contained within convention, habit, the titles of positions and the 'name on the door' so to speak.  If we are going to put a line in the sand somewhere, then sociologists are more interested in how groups form and how membership in a certain group mediates ones experience. Anthropologist are more concerned with how individuals or communities navigate the world and make meaning of it. key here is that groups and communities are not necessarily the same (although they may be). White people comprise an intelligible *group*, but not a meaningful community. That is, anthropologists are less interested (in a single study anyway) in studying across meaning-making communities, for it is difficult/impossible to do ethnography among people who do not share membership is a certain group (which may or may not be an *ethnic* group). Sociologists, in general (though less so cultural sociologists) would still be interested in the way that group membership (e.g. white skin) mediates experiences and opportunities, even if there are not specific meaning making practices that they study that transpire *between* members of this group.  Another way to think of it: because scholars in these two disciplines think about groups a little differently, sociologists will care more about how people *get grouped* (by institutions, social forces, states, etc) and anthropologists are more likely to care about how people produce/participate in communities and make meaning out of this participation. But again, these may not be hard wired into the discipline but rather a product of what colleagues care about. Edit to add: we could say that (most) sociocultural anthropologists are today fundamentally concerned with meaning making processes. Sociologists are not necessarily concerned with this (though many are).   To give some context, cultural sociologists and sociocultural anthropologists are neighbors, who likely share much more in common with each other than they do with people on the far side of their own discipline. Like people living in Vancouver and Seattle might share more in common culturally than the seattle resident does with a florida resident and the vancouver resident does with someone from rural quebec.  So a *real* answer is far less dependent on 'inherent' or 'conceptual' differences, because conceptual and theoretical differences are at least as much a result - rather than a cause - of sociohistorical factors.  &#x200B;  So the real difference between sociocultural anthropologists and cultural sociologists (which I think is the real question you are asking, for the one you have is not comparing like entities) depends largely on which bodies of theory you are using and who you are citing. It's as much about the scholars toward whom your work is oriented as much as it is about inherent differences between these two subfields.  &#x200B;  A ridiculous analogy:  are americans and canadians really that different? Maybe not.  the main difference is of course their citizenship (ie. their location within the academy, the name on the door). These different citizenships do indeed *create* different cultures and americans tend to be oriented towards the US more and Canadians more toward canada, but it is not as if it was the cultural differences between americans and canadians that *first* produced the national boundary. Rather, the national boundary is perhaps what produced the differences! so american media end up reporting on american issues more because *that's what their readers care about* and same thing for canada - not simply because there is a substantive difference in the kind of issues that americans and canadians care about.  &#x200B;  But again - just to make the point one last time - these differences are largely reified *by the disciplines themselves.* its perhaps not that they are inherently so different themselves (as a quick look over intertwined histories of the disciplines indicates) but that students in sociology programs have to take X courses, which develops X1 skills, which leads to conceptualizing and addressing problems in X2 ways, whereas anthropologists take Y courses, which develops Y1 skills....etc.  And because sociologists are indeed concerned with larger groups (rather strictly with  meaning-making communities) they are necessarily going to be, by and large, more quantitatively oriented and comfortable dealing with larger data sets. Anthropologists are usually comfortable deal with thicker data sets.",

            " Historically speaking, sociology came from folkloristics. Basically, anthropologists traveled abroad to study other cultures but they didn't really cared about studying their own societies. That how folkloristics as a discipline were born. Folklorists started by studying the cultural and social practices of the peasants. Some even arguing that european peasants weren't so different than other type of \"savages\" (not my word). But then they moved on from only studying peasants to studying other social groups within their own societies. That's what the original difference between sociology and anthropology was. Anthropologists studies other people societies while sociologists studied their own society. But it's not true anymore.   Another difference is that, traditionally, sociologists favor the quantitative approach while anthropologists will prefer the qualitative approach. But this is also not always true.  Soooo, to answer your question, the modern difference between social anthropology and sociology isn't a difference of goal but a difference of means. The reason why sociology and social anthropology are seen as two different disciplines is because they have two different histories. And those histories are still relevant to their current methodologies, theories and subject matters."

The difference between social and cultural anthropology just doesn't exist in the US, because the departments here began rather untethered from the general thread of \"Social Science.\"  At the end of the day, these are just labels that people put on departments, journals, and professional associations; people who police what counts as counts as one field or another are being pedantic.",
        "rejected_target": " Historically speaking, sociology came from folkloristics. Basically, anthropologists traveled abroad to study other cultures but they didn't really cared about studying their own societies. That how folkloristics as a discipline were born. Folklorists started by studying the cultural and social practices of the peasants. Some even arguing that european peasants weren't so different than other type of \"savages\" (not my word). But then they moved on from only studying peasants to studying other social groups within their own societies. That's what the original difference between sociology and anthropology was. Anthropologists studies other people societies while sociologists studied their own society. But it's not true anymore.   Another difference is that, traditionally, sociologists favor the quantitative approach while anthropologists will prefer the qualitative approach. But this is also not always true.  Soooo, to answer your question, the modern difference between social anthropology and sociology isn't a difference of goal but a difference of means. The reason why sociology and social anthropology are seen as two different disciplines is because they have two different histories. And those histories are still relevant to their current methodologies, theories and subject matters."

    "\n\nHuman: What are some interesting oral traditions/stories that have plausibility or evidence to back them up? They could be from any time period, but specifically I was thinking of oral histories, stories or myths that were passed down from pre-writing eras.  An example of one that interests me: apparently there is an indigenous tribe in Northern Australia that has a dream time myth where its tribal animal crossed the sea to a new homeland (Australia).  The 'plausibility' is this may be a story that traced back to the aborigines original crossing of the ocean into Australia from Southeast Asia.  They could be like these or they could have stronger plausibility or even evidence supporting them\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Help with a multiple allergy dessert Looking for help with some suggestions for a dessert to make for guests with several allergies. I work at a restaurant where we have a chef's tasting option available to our guests, and i have a table coming in celebrating a birthday in a few days wanting to do a chef's tasting. They were kind enough to email us well ahead of their visit to let us know about their allergies, and I can easily accommodate their requests as far as the first 4 courses go, but I'm having a little trouble coming up with a dessert for them. Their allergies are as follows- cow dairy, corn, cane sugar, agave, dates, peanuts, soy. Really not much of an issue as far as savory courses go, but I'm having a hard time coming up with a dessert dish for them that isn't just a pudding or a sorbet, the no dates or cow dairy make it kind of hard, and I'd really like to make a cake with frosting if possible. It's really not in the budget to buy things like coconut sugar or specialty flours or anything like that right now just to be used for this tasting, but i have access to most items you might expect a nicer restaurant to have. I am currently thinking about a chocolate avocado cake with a goat cheese frosting, but i don't really have any recipes to pull from, thats just off the top of my head.

    "\n\nHuman: Single-acting vs Double-acting baking powder in Banh Bo Nuong I'm thinking of attempting to bake a Vietnamese sponge cake from my childhood called Banh Bo Nuong. I've read so many recipes claiming that ONLY single-acting baking powder should be used, while others saying double-acting baking powder works fine. It's a very particular recipe as the technique and leavening agent used should result in a honeycomb striation. Otherwise, it could result in a dense fallen cake.   I just want to know why it would make such a huge difference. I understand that single-acting baking powder activates on contact with liquid, while double-acting baking powder activates once when added and again when heated. I'd like to find out the reason why it would make such a big difference in this recipe. If the goal is to get the cake to rise and create bubbly striations, wouldn't the double-acting baking powder be more effective? Yet the traditional Vietnamese recipes are adamant that single-acting baking powder is a must. This recipe is simple, but easy to fail, so I'd like to find out which baking powder is more effective and why it would make a difference.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Why do my cookies smell and taste weird? I have made them basically the same way many times before and never had this problem, but yesterday after I took them out of the oven they had a really weird smell. I don't know how to describe it, kind of like what I would imagine rotting flour to smell like? I thought maybe there was something wrong with one of the ingredients, so today I replaced most of the ingredients and tried again. Same smell, except maybe slightly less so. Also I tried tasting them and they were maybe slightly sour (although I'm not so sure about this, I was too off put by the smell to thoroughly taste them).  I don't know what could have changed, and I've replaced most of the ingredients already with fresh(er) ones. Could it be because I added salt in with the eggs before mixing and it's messing with them somehow? Could it be the remains from something previously cooked in the oven being absorbed into the cookies somehow? Could I have been unlucky and got bad eggs twice in a row in 2 different cartons? I have no idea, hopefully someone has a suggestion :/  &#x200B;  In case it helps, here is how I make the dough. The only things that weren't new the second time were salt, vanilla and molasses. I don't think I can notice a strong bad smell while it's raw either.  1) 250g melted butter + \\~250g sugar + \\~1 tablespoon molasses : Mix  2) 2 eggs + \\~10?mL vanilla essence + \\~10?g salt : Mix  3) 1 teaspoon baking powder + \\~330g flour : Mix  4) \\~200g chocolate chips : Mix\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Making something REALLY Crunchy? Hello All,  I am doing probably my most difficult baking goal: Making something *really* crunchy.  I have been pouring over recipes that people have posted and have been trial-and-erroring. However, I'm trying to nail down that \"crunch\" like with that chocolate crisp cookies or cereal have. When I add too much liquid to a batch, the baked good became chewy and not crunchy. Too little, and forming anything becomes incredibly difficult! I tried a slower and quicker bake. Mixed results.  Now, I'm currently using Oat flour in making my experiments. From there, I use something like honey, peanut butter, etc. I can get it to be granola-like crunchy (not bad) but that *hard, deep crunch* is being elusive!!!   How do I go beyond a crunch into a *CRUUUNCH?*\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Agree with the others that cream cheese frosting on a cheesecake is too much cream cheese. And I personally wouldn't like vanilla frosting on cheesecake. I feel like that's for regular cake, and wouldn't like the texture mix.   I personally like fruit as a topping on my cheesecake, as it's a heavy, rich type of cake, and fruit is a nice light contrast. If you're feeling overwhelmed with choice or complexity, you can always just use some canned pie filling as a topping.    If you'd like some ideas, \"cheesecake topping\" in Pinterest will provide you with more ideas than you can ever make. Chocolate ganache, caramel, raspberry sauce, the list goes on.",

    "\n\nHuman: Cheesecake rising a lot Following this recipe: https://iambaker.net/chocolate-raspberry-cheesecake/#wprm-recipe-container-65262  I did 1 tsp of lemon extract instead of 1.5 tsp raspberry extract. I also mixed the puree in with just half the batter rather than the whole thing.  My cheesecake is rising a whole bunch and I'm not sure why. Maybe over mixing?  Pics: https://imgur.com/a/NjR9pNQ  Maybe a bit hard to tell but that's the cheesecake rising well above the springform pan. These are after 1 hr 45 minutes of cooking then 2hrs. They were still wobbly but I stopped after 2hrs.  Any advice?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " A cheesecake is essentially a baked custard. Like a custard it doesn't bake so much as it sets once the eggs reach a particular temperature and then are allowed to cool.  According to Stella Parks in her seriouseats.com New York cheesecake recipe (https://www.seriouseats.com/epic-new-york-cheesecake-from-bravetart) \"cracking is the result of over-baking and nothing more.\" Her recipe provides oven temperatures and baking times but specifies baking to a particular internal temperature as measured by a probe thermometer (145F/63C), which is enough to set the eggs but below the point where escaping steam will cause rising.  Cracking would seem to indicate that the cheesecake has not just risen but that the proteins have started to denature and contract and lost their ability to cling to one another, which happens when they are overheated past a certain temperature threshold. Think of overcooked scrambled eggs, where when cooked to a certain point they release all of their moisture and become 'dry'. https://www.abbykidder.com/projectbakebook/2020/07/11/recipe-development-the-cheesecake-cracking-problem/  Rising is not necessarily a problem. Some rising is hard to avoid, from steam escaping from moisture in the wet ingredients or from air bubbles expanding. But a cheesecake won't hold a rise, it will collapse back down as it cools and form a slightly uneven surface - a perceived flaw which many recipes including yours conceal with a sweetened sour cream or fruit or ganache layer spread on top. Steam escaping does indicate that the cheesecake is getting hot enough for water to become gas, and that is maybe hotter than you want or need to set your eggs, and may be hot enough to overcook the eggs.  It's possible your recipe bakes too hot and you could get a better result with a slower, longer, lower bake, and a probe thermometer for exactness. Or maybe it's fine and the rising should not be worried about.  It's quite difficult to achieve a perfectly flawless uncoloured cheesecake in a home oven. Convection fans will ruin any chance of that, for one thing, as the forced air circulation dries out the surface and promotes browning over a long bake time.",

            " I have some Fat Daddio cake pans and really like them. I've found a lot of them at Homegoods (in the TJMaxx/Marshall's family of stores). Better than Wilton pans. I recommend going to Sugar Geek Show's website and looking up her recipe for Cake Goop, her homemade pan release. It works super well.  An offset spatula and a flat cake scraper will be helpful too. I have been using a 6\" bench scraper. I got a Wilton cake scraper but it has a plastic handle in the middle that kept leaving dents in my cake so I'm not a big fan.   For cake decorating start simple. Some nice quality disposable piping bags (the ones from someplace like Michael's are fine, just not a super flimsy one that will burst its seams) and a 1M piping tip are good to start with! Great for cakes or cupcakes.",

Very versatile.  4. Flat sheet trays- cookies, macarons, etc. handy to have extra on hand for big batches of bakes  5. Oven thermometer- just for better oven temp reading. 6. Silicon spatula- get small, medium, and large. Great for cooking stuff like compote, caramel, creme anglaise, pastry cream. The way silicon spatula bends allows better scrapping to prevent burns on the bottom of pan. Not all spatula are made equal, good ones usually has burgandy red handle and white scraper tip. 7. Rolling pins- i prefer just the slab of wood, ive never liked metals with mechanical handles that rotates on its own as they break easily. 8. Hand mixer- if you cant afford a stand mixer, atleast get a hand mixer. Good for heavy duty mixing like meringue, buttercream, frosting, foams. 9. Palette knife aka metal spatula- good for spreading batters, leveling frosting, decorating, etc.  10. Whisk- get a medium and large ones, get ones with thick flexible wires and very wide balloon shapes as that whips and mixes better.  11.

Silicone spatulas, whisk, a big metal spoon (comes in handy when you fold egg whites into your batter, though it\u2019s optional)."

    "\n\nHuman: reliable baking basics recipes Hi all! I'm looking for recipe source recommendations.   I currently get my recipes from all over. New York Times, Food Network and Bon Appetit can be good, but they don't always have good recipe basics (yellow cake, swiss buttercream, puff pastry, pie fillings, etc) that don't involve some kind of health \"hack\" or trendy ros\u00e9/tahini/avocado/golden mylk twist. I like all of those listed things, but I just want to make a regular old chocolate cake/molasses cookie/cinnamon roll etc. The sites can also be hard to navigate... I looked up coffee cake (the kind with the crumb topping) on Bon App's website the other day and classic coffee cake wasn't in the results, but it was recommended underneath a recipe I used later that day. So it existed, but the search engine didn't work, a problem I've also had on NTY. These recipes are typically solid, but they're not super easy to find.   Blogs are often unreliable, especially the live-laugh-love-watercolor-calligraphy-karen ones that start every recipe with a rejected dissertation on how her husband, real estate job, and 2.5 kids achieved salvation through her keto-coconut-peppermint-schnapps-filled-cakepops. They're often ad-filled and the recipes themselves are bunk.   I usually know when the problem was with me or the recipe. I'm just having a hard time finding sources with dependable recipe basics so I can improve my technique. Does anyone have any leads?  Thanks in advance for any help!!!\n\nAssistant:": {

Trying to whisk with a fork is not at all practical (I have a very stubborn friend who insisted she could make a meringue with a fork once. It took about an hour with her and her boyfriend taking turns whisking with the fork, then handing it over to the other once their arms got tired. They managed, but they were sore after and she bought a whisk a few days later).  A caring boyfriend won\u2019t mind if it\u2019s not from scratch :) $3 for a box mix makes way more sense than spending a bunch of money on equipment you might not use again, or stressing out and hurting your arms trying to whisk with a fork.",

If you use the blender you will need to be careful to not over whip the whites, and you\u2019ll have to finish mixing the batter in a bowl, not the blender.

So why not Toyota develop a hybrid turbo power unit like a Formula 1 car in pursuit of maximum efficiency?

I took my 2022 Subaru BRZ to a well-reviewed family owned muffler shop 10 days ago and had them install an exhaust for me. Last Friday while washing my car I found this damage on my car, paint completely stripped off under my passenger door, and a lazy attempt to hide it. I keep my car in a secured garage and hadn\u2019t taken it to a different shop aside from them. My mechanic friends confirmed it and said the damage was right where an  arm from a 2-post lift would swing under if the tech was careless and didn\u2019t realize my car sits lower than your typical SUV, so he swung it under without checking and damaged it.  On Friday I called the muffler shop owner politely asking them if it was them, and he denied and said his tech didn\u2019t do it and that they were \u201cgood guys\u201d. I was furious because clearly they wouldn\u2019t admit if if they tried to cover it up with white tape. I then asked him for the security footage and he told me he\u2019d \u201cspeak with his superior\u201d and get back to me next week, and that he also believes nothing happened. This morning I called him again and he kept dodging me, saying he\u2019ll get back to me later and that his superior wasn\u2019t in yet (but reviews state that he himself is the owner) and he thinks that they didn\u2019t do it. He is refusing to show me the security footage, which I\u2019m unsure if there was any in the first place and I\u2019m losing my patience.

    "\n\nHuman: I was driving down the highway, smelt something and then all of a sudden lost my vision, heart started racing and had to throw up. Mechanic says he can't find anything wrong. 2012 Honda Civic - what in the world happened that no one is thinking of? Hi car guys!     So, I just got off of the phone with my mechanic and am sitting here in a very confused state. The first thing that popped into my head was to google \"car help\" and \"Reddit\" - I need you guys. Here's what's going on with me: I drive a 2012 Honda Civic. I don't know if I need to specify it's a hybrid - I know nothing about cars and if that's an assumed thing with this vehicle. Last Friday, I was doing 80 down the highway in the left lane, heard something hit the bottom of my car, looked in the rearview just out of reaction and saw a little black thing bouncing to the next car behind me. Nothing major.  So, not even 3 minutes later, you guys, my vision on the sides goes black, my heart is RACING and I feel like I have to puke. I pull over to the shoulder, flung the door open and got out with the dog. I was bent over the median, breathing and trying to regain my composure when luckily a state cop came up behind me and helped me out. I told him, \"I was driving perfectly fine, I THINK I heard or felt something scrape or hit the bottom of the car - but nothing bigger than a normal like, rock or take out cup, and then I smelt a weird smell in my car through the AC, lost my peripheral vision, heart started going wild and I had to throw up.\" He's looking at me like I'm insane. He says that he sees no leak, to get back in my car and keep going - that I am fine.   I get back in, I start the car up, I pull back into the flow of traffic and within a minute, I feel sick again and think I smell a weird smell. I'm not talking eggs, it was not sulfuric at all. There WAS a mix of a gas smell, but the only way I can accurately and best describe it is just: \"chemically\". So I feel sick, get off the closest exit, pull into the truck stop, turn it off and get out and walk away from it again with my dog. For 3 hours, I sat and waited for a tow. I ended up having it towed to the mechanic's because every time I tried turning it on and getting it going, I would feel sick and have to throw up. It was so BIZARRE. My dad calls, says \"roll down all of your windows, turn off all AC/heat/everything and pull your mask up over your face, tell me what happens.\" I do this, I'm fine for like 5 minutes, then it hits again and I get sick and I turn it off. That's when I did decide to have it towed, cause he said that was too weird to chance me driving it back myself.   I had it dropped off at the mechanic's and it's been there a week now. I just got off of the phone with him, finally, and he's like, \"....I cannot find anything wrong with it. I checked your fluids, I've been looking, but nothing. Your Hybrid light just came on, that's new, so I don't know if it's that but I'm going to keep looking and I'll call you back tonight again,\" and now here I am. I trust our guy with everything - I've gone to him for like 8 years now - he isn't full of shit. I am sitting here questioning my sanity now though. What in the WORLD happened, is happening and is going to happen if I drive it again!? I am now like, \"Did your body freak out and you had a weird attack and it had nothing to do with the car?\" I'll tell you, that's never happened to me before but I guess there's a first for everything.  Again, 2012 Honda Civic, Hybrid. Bought from a dealership in 2017. We have 100k miles on it right now. Have had zero issues with it and we keep up with it like it's our baby. Any thoughts?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Should I finance or pay outright for a used car? Hello, I have recently turned nineteen and I still have no car. I have my license, but I have no luck in finding a used one that fits all the criteria I am looking for.  When it comes to cars, I am financially on my own. I have been looking in places like Offer Up and the even the Facebook Marketplace for used cars. I find myself talking to sellers who lie about either the title of their vehicle, the mileage, any car accidents etc. I feel like I would just be settling for a car this way.   I am currently in college and I have managed to save up over $12k working fast food over the years. I have a credit score of 708(according to Experian). I plan to move out in around two years. I'm planning on finding a better job too. I know I fit the criteria for financing a car. I could even put down around $3-5k for down payment. My paychecks are not the highest though. At most, I get paid around $600 biweekly. I also have to keep insurance and gas money in mind.   If I bought a used car off someone, my budget would be $7.5k. The more cars I find, the more I realize how so many sellers are overpricing their vehicles for no reason. A 2005 Honda Accord LT with over 110k miles should NOT be $8k. When I finally find a car on Offer up that I think is a good deal, someone else swoops in a takes it before I can get my hands on it.   I've been working my ass off over the years and I want my money to be put to good use. I want be able to proudly drive around this car and be confident in its reliability. Buying my first car will be an investment. Should I just keep looking and hope that I will find a good used car off someone or should I finance a used car? Help!\n\nAssistant:": {

            " The problem with used cars bought from independent parties, in my experience, is nobody ever wants to take the time out of their day to let you get the car checked by a mechanic. You should ***never, and i mean NEVER***, buy a used car without getting it checked by a mechanic. I was looking for a car for 6 months, and finally settled on a 2007 Dodge Caravan, because it had minimal rust and \"only\" 185k miles. But the whole front end needs to be rebuilt. Suspension, tie rod ends, struts, brakes, engine and transmission mounts, sway bar links and bushings. All need replaced. I would've known this if I had taken it to a mechanic, but after 6 months of people refusing to let me do so with any car I was interested in, I'd grown tired of the process. Lesson learned.  I would strongly recommend buying from a dealership. Sometimes they have cheaper used cars, sometimes they don't. At the very least, your $7.5k could be a down payment on a used car from a dealership. Dealerships usually don't give you any shit about getting the car checked by a mechanic, so you can have peace of mind going into the transaction. That being said, the key word there is \"usually\". Always remember to either walk away if they won't let you get it checked, ***OR*** leave room in your budget for repairs. In my case, the front end work on my van comes out to about $2.5k, and aside from engine and transmission replacement, front end work is some of the most expensive you can do on a car. So I'd say leave about $3k in your budget for potential repairs, if you decide to forego the mechanic check.",

            " Paying outright is almost always a better idea, especially while you\u2019re young and don\u2019t have a lot of debt. Never buy anything, wether it be a loan or a car, on money/income you don\u2019t have yet, because that can always fall through.  As for cars, Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic\u2019s are both great options to look at right now, although the Corolla will be more pricey; Toyota\u2019s seem to be over priced more so than the rest on the market. If you\u2019re willing to learn how to drive manual, if you don\u2019t know how to already, then I would challenge you to find one that is manual. They cheaper, more reliable, and easier to work on making maintenance costs lower.  If you\u2019re willing to learn, doing all of your own maintenance is probably the best investment, not only in yourself, but in your car, that you could make. You save a lot of money on labor this way, and if you find a car easy enough to work on then you save a lot of heart ache. Honestly, an old-ish truck is not a bad option if you\u2019re willing to learn to work on your own cars. They\u2019re very easy to work on, lots more room to work, parts are much cheaper, and they\u2019re very versatile."

    "\n\nHuman: Should I buy a manual as my first car even if I live in a busy city? Just some context: I'm 19. Been driving an automatic regularly for just over two years now. I took a couple manual lessons in a Subaru brz and felt pretty comfortable afterwards, mostly because my instructor told me that if I was able to get comfortable on a brz then I probably wouldn't have much of an issue with most cars. Anyways, I knew that I needed more experience before making the decision to buy a manual car, so I convinced my dad to rent some rundown Kia rio that I found on Turo. And yes, learning/practicing on some random guys car is kind of a scumbag move, I know. But to be fair, it was barely in working order and has over 100,000 miles on it. I ended up having the car for a week because it was so cheap to rent and managed to put in at least two hours of city driving per day to make sure that I covered a wide range of experiences.  At this point, I don't really have to put much thought into driving manual and don't worry about stalling. I've been saving up for a long ass time and can't keep myself from getting excited by the thought of picking up a 2012 S4 that I've had my eye on, but I'm kind of afraid that in a couple months my current 'honeymoon' period with manuals will be over and I'll regret my decision. Do you guys ever regret buying a manual when you're sitting in traffic almost every day, or stuck in a several hour pileup on the highway? Did you experience a decline in your overall driving satisfaction after the novelty faded?  &#x200B;  TL;DR: If I still really enjoy driving stick even after a week of city driving (15+ hrs, mix of rush-hour, daytime, night), do you think I might still regret buying a manual after a few months? Did you regret buying a manual? Is it way less interesting once the novelty wears off? Any other advice for a prospective manual owner?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: I made a huge mistake and bought used car in CA that I (effectively) can't register. What can I do with this dud of a car? Yeah, firstly, I'm a huge dumbass, get your laughs in lol. I'm no car guy. Lesson learned. Don't buy used without making sure it has passed a smog check in the Golden State.  It's a 2002 Camry LE which looks awful, but runs great. Problem is, both of the car's catalytic converters need to be replaced, and to do so would cost way more than a sane person ought to spend on this car (more than I spent on buying it, and way more than I have laying around my account).  Since you're legally not supposed to sell a car without also including a smog check pass, I tried to contact the seller, but of course he ran off. That's another long story, I'm certain I just got duped. I don't know what part of his story or information is legit, and at this point it seems like it will be too much money to track him down and open a case against him in court.  So, basically, I have this unregistered car in my driveway. I have the old title and old registration in the seller's name (my name is on the title on the transfer side), but no documentation under my name.  My goal is to get rid of this car and hopefully get some portion of my money back. Cash for Clunkers can't take it without its cat converts and no title/reg. Kars 4 Kids could take it, but the tax rebate would go to the seller (because the title is in his name). It seems like selling to a junkyard also requires some registration and such.  Does anyone know what a dumbass like me can do to maybe, hopefully, get rid of this car and get any amount of money back on this landmine of a craigslist purchase? Hell, what can I do even if I give up on getting any money back? Happy to answer any questions, maybe through DM if sensitive. Thanks all.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Used Mercedes C43 AMG (4WD) or New Tesla model 3 standard plus (RWD)?    As the title suggests I am trying to decide between the two cars. I have test driven the C43 and love it, I haven't driven a model 3 yet but will test drive one before considering buying. I would be looking to get a used version with premium plus and performance exhaust options for \\~ \u00a335k. For \u00a338k I can get a Tesla model 3, I have always wanted a Tesla (or other decent electric car) and was thinking about having one after my next car. I currently divide my time between my parents houses, my mum is currently selling her house so cant really get a home charger installed so 3 pin charging only for me there, and at my dads I cannot charge at all. There is some fast chargers near me though.  I currently have an alfa romeo giulia veloce (rwd) that costs a fortune to insure and fuel so the AMG wouldn't be much different, but the model 3 would be cheaper to run. I want to get rid of my alfa for a few reasons: 1) its falling apart, 2) its crap in the snow, literally wont go anywhere.  I should also point out that im currently saving for my own house so the model 3 might be better for that as my petrol and servicing costs for a year currently run about \u00a34500. But, the AMG is a much more fun car to drive and listen to.  If you had to pick between the two options, what would you go for and why.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " To give you some perspective, I am more familiar with Indian flatbreads like roti and paratha which are very very similar to a tortilla. Oil or ghee (clarified butter - acts near identical to tallow) is often added to the dough.   Thing is, I'm a wheat roti or paratha, what holds it together is the wheat gluten, not the added fat. The fat makes it more supple and pliable so it bends more easily without breaking up.  Alternately, a more common practice is to slather the tortilla/roti with oil or fat of your choice when it is cooking in the griddle. Even if you don't mix any fat in the dough, it still ends up supple and soft if you add fat while it is in the griddle.  Look up videos of \"Kati roll\" which is similar to a taco.  In all this, I have not considered a corn tortilla which you might be referring to. But from my limited experience of cooking corn rotis, the added fat stays binded to the tortilla while cooking. I personally think your experiment of using marrow should work.",

    "\n\nHuman: Can I split the cooking time for the pork shoulder over two days? I'm following this recipe from Serious Eats for a pork shoulder with the intention of serving it for Christmas lunch. It calls for an initial 8-hour roast in a low oven, followed by a rest (up to 2 hours) and then a 20-minute roast at a high temperature to finish with crispy skin.  I'd love to serve this for lunch, but I'd also love to not have to wake up before 4am on Christmas Day.  Would it be possible to do the 8-hour roast on the 24th, let the pork cool to room temperature and stick it in the fridge overnight, and then do the high-temp 20-minute roast shortly before my guests sit down to lunch on the 25th?  This other Serious Eats recipe for a roasted prime rib is pretty similar and indicates that if the first roast is finished way before guests arrive, the meat can be brought back up to temp by cooking for 45 minutes in a 200F oven before the final high-temp roast. Is there any reason that wouldn't work for a pork shoulder?  Thanks!  Also, if anyone has an recommendations for good sides with a roasted pork shoulder, I'm all ears.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " So one point that has been overlooked is sugars vs burning or over browning.  To get anything crispy, you need to get the temperature of it far above that of water and a little above the temps at which sugars start to burn.  The problem with sweet potatoes is that they're high in sugar and they'll burn far easier than they'll crisp up.  The solution is to remove as much starch as possible by cutting, rinsing, blanching, chilling and cooking them again to get them crispy.  The second part is to inhibit the starches from caramelizing in the first place by acidifying the wedges slightly.  Caramelization and the maillard reaction is delayed the lower the pH goes.  A healthy squeeze of lemon juice in the blanching water is a good start since citric acid is a very effective acid.  Even better would be granulated citric acid in the lukewarm soaking water.  Not too much though.  Maybe 1tbsp per gallon of water.",

            " I love making roasted sweet potatoes in the oven but if you place too many on the sheet they will inevitably steam instead of roast. It takes longer but make sure each potato has about 2 or more inches from the next piece.  Even with a fan oven vegetables will steam if they\u2019re piled on top of each other.   If you are cooking a large quantity just do this with multiple sheets and when you need to serve them throw them on broil for a minute or 2. Good luck!",
            " Heat the oil in the pan first. When you lay the wedges down they should sizzle",
            " As someone else has mentioned, double cooking them does wonders. I used the Serious Eats method at first, but have since just kind of done it by feel each time.  1. Basically cut the potatoes into the size you want to roast them at, and toss them in a pot of boiling water (with some salt).  1. Boil them until a skewer (cake tester, fork, etc) passes through them without any resistance.  1. Drain, and toss them with your fat of choice (duck, bacon, oil, etc). Add some salt or other seasoning as well at this point (I usually toss this after the fat).  1. Roast them for 15 minutes a side at 400-425, flip them, and roast them for another 15 minutes. 1. Add the rest of the seasoning if desired.  Notes  * Serious Eats has a discussion about adding them to boiling water vs heating them up if you're interested to know about that (they also call for some baking soda, but I usually pass on that). * After boiling, I usually toss them into the empty hot pot for a bit to evaporate the excess water on them before adding the fat. * For seasoning, I'm not sure if it's better to add the salt before/after roasting, and haven't made them enough to settle on a conclusion. * Modify the bake time if you're going hotter, and check on them to make sure they don't overcrisp.",

    "\n\nHuman: I had sudden, excruciating pain in the left side of my head for a few seconds, then collapsed. What should I do now? 20 years old, female.  For the past two weeks, the top of my head has been very sensitive and sore, with varying levels of pressure. At times, it feels like somebody might as well be standing on the top of my head with all their weight. I've also had sensitive skin, pins and needles, etc, allover the rest of my body since I was about 16, on/off.  Last night, it felt like that pressure \"slipped\" and \"hit\" my left brow bone. That's the only way I can think to describe it. It felt like something was trying to escape my skull through my eye. It was a throbbing pain and at a certain point, it was almost so painful that I didn't feel it anymore. I thought I was dying.  The pain was radiating through my skull, to my neck and my spine. It then felt like my stomach was floating into my chest, then I began to shiver allover and my legs gave out.  When I collapsed, I fell backwards and hit my head. I saw stars and felt extremely weak allover. I didn't have the strength to stand up, nor to pull myself around.  Since then, I've felt very distant and absolutely exhausted. All of my joints are sore and my brain feels very foggy. I see trails when things move in front of me and I still see stars in my peripheral sometimes. I also notice my jaw tensing by itself.  I'm on sertraline and a vitamin D supplement.  I haven't hit my head or been in any accidents prior to this. I did have some untreated concussions as a kid, but that was years ago. Both my mother and grandmother have MS.  Sorry if this is a bit messy, I still don't feel quite right. I'm happy to add any info I may have missed.\n\nAssistant:": {

Male: 17, 60kg (132 pounds), dont smoke, dont drink, physicslly active: runner, medication: bupropion, medical conditions: depression, height: 175cm (5 foot 7). Basically i think i got the flu. I had 105.8 degree (41 celcius) fever yesterday and couldnt drink or eat nor walk. Had a heartbeat of 110 when i was lying down doing nothing. Was about to put on a surigcal mask to prevent spreading the disease and jumping on a train to the hosp, but felt like i was being overdramatic and too weak so i stayed home.  I slept 14h today, and i am feeling a bit better, fever down to 104, slower heart beat, could eat and drink. Probably has something to do with the fact that i took fever and infammation lindering meds. But now my lips and fingernails are turning dark purple and im worried it might have something to do with oxygen intace, or the lack of it? I study and live abroad so no parents who can take care of me. Should i put on a mask to prevent spreading the virus and get on a train to the hosp or wait for a bit longer and see if i improve? I have insurance.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Seeking medical advice on the abortion process of a friend of mine In our country, abortion is strictly illegal and is punishable by up to 6 years of imprisonment, which makes it very hard to seek medical advice regarding the subject. My friend is very much certain that she wants an abortion, and I hope that people here respect that.  My friend currently is 18 years old, and she has iron deficiency anemia, type 1 diabetes, and high blood pressure. She had sex with her boyfriend on June 22, and had just recently found out that she is pregnant after a delay in her period (which she should have had on July 12). She plans on taking Cytotec, Mifepristone, and Methergine, which she have bought from a trusted underground seller here.   That being said, given her underlying health conditions, is it safe for her to undergo with the medical abortion using the said drugs, and what are the possible risks?  If yes, can you give us some advices on how to safely do the procedure? And if no, can you give us some alternative drugs or procedures?  Also, please do take note that the procedure would take place without the assistance of any health professional. Only her boyfriend and I will help her throughout the process, so if possible, please be in-depth with the explanations.   Thank you very much in advance.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " First, I am sorry that you do not have a medical professional locally that can help you with this. It is difficult to give advice on these things without a relationship with the patient. Especially because you have minimal support from medical professionals if the advice leads to complications.   That being said, I will write out my general counseling when I have helped a woman with a medication abortion in the past.   In the US, we only use mifepristone and misoprostol for medication abortion. Methergine is a medicine used to make the uterus contract and decrease bleeding. It is contraindicated in hypertension. Without going into details with a physician and monitoring, I would not use methergine.   How I counsel patients: 1. Medication administration: take the mifepristone, and 24-48 hours later take the misoprostol (800mcg). You should start to have cramping and bleeding within 12 hours of taking this.  2. What to expect: Nausea and cramping (usually more than period cramps) and bleeding like a heavy period. You may or may not pass clots and tissue. By the end of 24 hours from the start of bleeding, it should be tapering off to a lighter flow similar to a period.  I usually send medication for nausea to help.  For the cramping: Ibuprofen 800mg every 8 hours, staggered with Acetaminophen 1000mg every 6 hours. Some providers will give even stronger medication such as narcotics.  Please note, ibuprofen should be avoided in patients with kidney disease.  Please don\u2019t use anything in the vagina for bleeding.  3. When to go to the emergency room: Fever, feeling very unwell/severe dizziness. Especially with a history of anemia, she is at risk of heavy bleeding that could cause problems. Severe pain could be a sign of a complication as well. Lastly, heavy bleeding where you fill a pad an hour for more than two hours in a row should prompt going to the ED immediately.  4. Risks of the procedure: Heavy bleeding or life-threatening bleeding, failure of the medication (about 5-10% if less than 8 weeks along) and infection. These risks are substantially higher at more than 10 weeks gestation.   One last thought, in the unlikely event that she needs to go to the emergency room it is very difficult to tell the difference of a complicated medication abortion and natural miscarriage. A physician cannot tell the difference unless you disclose that information. I never recommend hiding information from your doctor, but I would also not want you to be discouraged from going to the emergency room in the interest of secrecy.    Hopefully, this if helpful to you!  EDIT:  5. Follow up: please follow up with a medical professional to ensure everything has passed safely and get effective contraception.  If the medication is unsuccessful you can have infections and other complications. Prevention of unintended pregnancy is the most important aspect of abortion care.  She should also know her blood type, because some guidelines recommend receiving a medication called Rhogam at the time of bleeding. This is to prevent antibodies from the embryo if you are Rh negative. Antibodies in your blood make future pregnancies and blood transfusions complicated and riskier."

    "\n\nHuman: Husband (48) frequently fainting, poor appetite, losing weight My husband for the past year has been frequently fainting and just had one of these spells. I was alerted to it because I heard his his head hit the tile floor in our kitchen. This isn\u2019t the first time he has been injured in one of these falls.  In addition to that his appetite has become increasingly poor. The only foods he can tolerate are rice milk, rice cereal and peanut butter toast. He has also lost a fair amount of weight (20 lbs in the last 6 months).  He has had a Colonoscopy/Endoscopy within the last several months that was clear. He was also tested for food sensitivities/allergies. He also has had blood work done and everything was good.  His health history has been good with the exception of a parasite he contracted approximately 6 years ago while traveling out of the country. This parasite put him in the ICU and almost killed him. Thankfully the ICU doctors were able to treat the parasite but he was left with holes in his intestines. He is unsure of type of parasite but is confident that he contracted it from water in Uzbekistan. After the parasite he was never able to fully gain all of the healthy weight he had pre-parasite.

    "\n\nHuman: Why are patients not sedated during IUD insertion? Hi medical professionals. I'm 24F who doesn't plan to have any kids. I'm a huge fan of my Mirena IUD, it's the best birth control method I have ever used. But at this point I've had two and both times the insertion pain is AWFUL. My friends share similar stories to this. I have broken bones and I personally have never been in more pain in my entire life. I threw up and fainted during my replacement. It seems really cruel that pain medication is not offered for such a painful procedure. My friends in Australia have told me that they got put under anaesthesia to get their IUDs placed. Why is this not a practice in the US?   I would do it again because I think its worth it, but dear lord I feel like I have PTSD. I shudder when I think about how bad it was.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " The short answer is that the risks of the anaesthesia aren't justified by the procedure.  There's a much longer answer but it amounts to 'some people are'.  It's important to note here that I'm male so you could say that I have no right to make the choice. I would counter by saying that I don't make the choice - I anaesthetise patients that surgeons ask me to anaesthetise (with some exceptions, obviously).  I've definitely anaesthetised some patients for iud insertion but they are generally having other things done too. It would be unusual to anaesthetise someone specifically for an IUD because, while some women suffer some discomfort (with some finding it no problem at all, some finding it very challenging and the rest in between), there is risk to anaesthetising people and, since there are alternatives, that risk is deemed unacceptable in most cases.  If you are already having a procedure and need an IUD then they will often insert it at the end of the procedure.   The other reason is that if people could opt for anaesthesia there would be added complexity and cost in the system. The usefulness of procedures and treatments is (in the uk at least) assessed by cost, risk, availability, opportunity cost (what else you'd have to give up in order to offer this treatment) and a range of other things.   By the criteria they use (and again, I don't make the choices here, I'm just the messenger) it's just not a viable plan. It doesn't make 'business sense'.  So that's anaesthesia but why not offer sedation? Surely that's less troublesome?   Unfortunately the technical details of giving sedation are almost as difficult to deal with as the technicalities of anaesthesia. There are ways around it for some procedures but it's not as simple as just giving an injection or taking a breath of gas. Technically sedation is subject to the same rules as anaesthesia (in the uk any way). In many cases it's actually easier to give a full anaesthetic than try to sedate someone. It's hard to explain why but if you bear in mind that Michael Jackson was 'just getting a little sedation' when he died you can see that the danger is real. You really do need people around who know exactly what to do when things go wrong. It's simply not possible to have those people around for everyone all the time so the rules are there to protect patients and they really are necessary.   It would be lovely if we could offer whatever people need whenever they need it. You'll note that I said need, not want - I do understand that this is a big problem and I'm sorry that people have to go without. But there's a balance between what we can offer and how far the funding has to go.   I hope some of that makes sense.",

            " So there are a lot of factors here.    Since this procedure is extremely fast, (the actual measuring and insertion take about 30-120 seconds) the risks of putting someone under general or twilight anesthesia are very high for the time needed to perform the procedure. This would also require nursing staff, training, and emergency procedures that are not possible for every small clinic. For general anesthesia, an operating room and anesthesiologist would be necessary, both of which come at great cost. Compare that to D&Cs, which are often done with twilight anesthesia (or partial sedation), and take 10-15 minutes, or a colonoscopy, which takes between 15 and 60 minutes. For someone who is completely unable to tolerate a vaginal exam of any kind, this may be an option if they want an IUD, but for these patients I usually recommend other birth control methods.  The other options are topical or injectable anesthetics. I think topical lidocaine or other anesthetic would be a great option, although I don\u2019t know how effective it would be through the entirety of the cervical muscle (it\u2019s thick). I would lean away from the injectable anesthetics, because for many if not most people the needle may be more painful than the rest of the actual procedure. In fact, at least one study found that an injected anesthetic did not change the perceived pain of the procedure, likely because the injection itself can be quite painful.  The last option is the one most people in the US use, an anti-inflammatory to soften the cervix and help with pain control. This is usually an NSAID: ibuprofen, naproxen, etc. It is unclear how effective this option is pre-procedurally, but it is standard care because of theoretical effect and low risks.  I don\u2019t know what factors other countries take into account for their IUD insertions, or if there are other pain management options that I am not familiar with, but these are my thoughts from a US perspective.  Edit: One other important thing worth mentioning is that the pain might not be as important as the vasovagal reaction. Passing out, sweating, and vomiting may actually be from a vasovagal reaction and not strictly from pain. If you feel like you may throw up or pass out, flex the muscles of your arms and legs as hard as you can. This can help reverse that feeling and prevent you from actually vomiting or passing out. IUD insertion is one of the most common reasons for a vasovagal reaction.",

I've heard that docs working with college populations tend to do more IUD work than most, and so are often better at it. (No idea if this is generally true, but my university doc was great.) I need to get it replaced soon and I'm dreading it, since I've moved and need to find a new doctor.",
        "rejected_target": " The short answer is that the risks of the anaesthesia aren't justified by the procedure.  There's a much longer answer but it amounts to 'some people are'.  It's important to note here that I'm male so you could say that I have no right to make the choice. I would counter by saying that I don't make the choice - I anaesthetise patients that surgeons ask me to anaesthetise (with some exceptions, obviously).  I've definitely anaesthetised some patients for iud insertion but they are generally having other things done too. It would be unusual to anaesthetise someone specifically for an IUD because, while some women suffer some discomfort (with some finding it no problem at all, some finding it very challenging and the rest in between), there is risk to anaesthetising people and, since there are alternatives, that risk is deemed unacceptable in most cases.  If you are already having a procedure and need an IUD then they will often insert it at the end of the procedure.   The other reason is that if people could opt for anaesthesia there would be added complexity and cost in the system. The usefulness of procedures and treatments is (in the uk at least) assessed by cost, risk, availability, opportunity cost (what else you'd have to give up in order to offer this treatment) and a range of other things.   By the criteria they use (and again, I don't make the choices here, I'm just the messenger) it's just not a viable plan. It doesn't make 'business sense'.  So that's anaesthesia but why not offer sedation? Surely that's less troublesome?   Unfortunately the technical details of giving sedation are almost as difficult to deal with as the technicalities of anaesthesia. There are ways around it for some procedures but it's not as simple as just giving an injection or taking a breath of gas. Technically sedation is subject to the same rules as anaesthesia (in the uk any way). In many cases it's actually easier to give a full anaesthetic than try to sedate someone. It's hard to explain why but if you bear in mind that Michael Jackson was 'just getting a little sedation' when he died you can see that the danger is real. You really do need people around who know exactly what to do when things go wrong. It's simply not possible to have those people around for everyone all the time so the rules are there to protect patients and they really are necessary.   It would be lovely if we could offer whatever people need whenever they need it. You'll note that I said need, not want - I do understand that this is a big problem and I'm sorry that people have to go without. But there's a balance between what we can offer and how far the funding has to go.   I hope some of that makes sense."

    "\n\nHuman: Dad likely died from a pulmonary embolism - Wondering what he experienced This is probably an unusual post for this sub. Please delete if not appropriate.\u00a0  My dad died suddenly at age 65 on 9/24 and the ER doc that pronounced him speculated that the cause was a pulmonary\u00a0embolism. He said that when they put a tube down his throat to open an airway there was blood present which is a sign of a PE. I guess part of my coming to terms with his death involves understanding his last seconds/minutes and what it was like from his perspective. I'm hoping a doctor\u00a0can offer some insight into what it is like to die from a pulmonary embolism.   We were texting back and forth at 7:21 am and he was totally fine; he left the house to go on his morning walk, and my mom found him dead in the middle of the road about an hour later. Looking through his Apple Watch data, his exercise\u00a0app showed 106 bpm and then suddenly went flat at 7:35 am. He was found face down with his arms by his side and a large contusion on his forehead. There was no evidence he even tried to break his fall, so clearly it happened quickly. Things I'm curious about:  Does the clot travel to the lungs and then cause suffocation? Would he have been experiencing lack of air in the moments leading up to his collapse and then just drop from that? What is it that actually happens physiologically from a PE to make someone go from walking to just face planting\u00a0dead? Is it likely he felt \"off\" or had some sort of warning or does it come out of nowhere?  Any insight is very much appreciated.\n\nAssistant:": {

There's absolutely no way to really say what your dad experienced, or even for sure that it was a pulmonary embolism that caused his heart to stop. If he did have a pulmonary embolism, the symptoms can range from absolutely nothing to things like feeling generally unwell/anxious, feeling short of breath, chest pain, and having heart palpitations or feeling a pounding heart. One of the reasons pulmonary embolisms are so tricky is that it can have very vague symptoms or symptoms that mimic a whole bunch of other things.  From the story you told, if he was having some symptoms beforehand, they were likely relatively on the mild sign since he felt well enough to go out for his morning run and was able to keep moving during it. What does seem very likely, however, is that whatever happened to cause his heart to stop beating happened very quickly, and he likely lost consciousness within seconds. A lot of times people who have a sudden cardiac arrest and are resuscitated describe either feeling some heart palpitations and a bit of discomfort or, sometimes--absolutely nothing, being conscious one moment and then out the next.

I\u2019m 52 yo female, 5ft 3in.  105lbs., No health problems, blood pressure 101/75. Did doing meth stop my brain from making dopamine? When will it start again? At first I was irritable, but I feel wonderful now. I still smoke cannabis, but I have cut down on my weed use considerably, this was unintentional. I went from smoking 10 times a day to 1 or 2 times a day. I\u2019ve known many people who tried to stop but usually use again after a week or so. I stopped cold turkey and honestly have no craving or desire to use this shit ever again. Is this normal? Thanks in advance\n\nAssistant:": {

To maintain motivation for abstinence 2. To cope with urges and craving 3. To manage thoughts, feelings and behaviours ( It asks participants to stop labelling themselves (no addict label), it also teaches you how to identify and change irrational beliefs to more rational and healthy beliefs.

After years of being free from addiction it's tempting to think that you could try a little bit again and that it would be different now that you're no longer addicted. You might tell yourself that you can control it now. Maybe you can, maybe you can't.",
            " It might be a good idea to join an addiction recovery meeting. Try to see if there is an NA or SMART meeting close to where you live. I facilitate SMART meetings so I'm gonna go ahead and explain to you what SMART is in case you're not familiar with it.  SMART stands for Self-Management and Recovery Training. It encourages individuals to gain independence from addictive behaviors using cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing. It has 4 main objectives:  1. To maintain motivation for abstinence 2. To cope with urges and craving 3. To manage thoughts, feelings and behaviours ( It asks participants to stop labelling themselves (no addict label), it also teaches you how to identify and change irrational beliefs to more rational and healthy beliefs. Example: I am a total failure or I'm totally worthless are both inaccurate and exaggerated downing beliefs which should be changed to more rational and realistic beliefs before they cause more upsetting feelings. So, every time you have a belief about yourself, try questioning it and see if it is a rational or irrational one. A rational belief is the one that's helpful, reasonable, flexible, constructive and leads to survival and happiness. We are humans and we all make mistakes. BUT our mistakes will not define who we are. We are not a total failure because we all have done some useful things in the past , and have had success.  Finally the last point of SMART (4) is to have a balanced lifestyle.  You need to register (for free) in order to have access to the forums. You can also search on the website and see if there is a meeting in your area; here is the link\" https://www.smartrecovery.org\"  Even if there isn't, you can always participate in the online meetings or live chat (for free):  https://www.smartrecovery.org/community/calendar.php  **Also, there is an online women-only forum if you can't attend the meetings in person.

It\u2019s when you stop talking about it and start being secretive that the darkness thrives, know what I mean?  when you do have a craving, the technique that helps me the most is to \u201cplay the tape all the way through\u201d. you\u2019ll start remembering the good things.. how it felt, etc.. but always play the tape until the end and think about the consequences too. so for example - yeah, using made me feel good and confident at the time but then I spent all my money on it which ended up causing me to be homeless in the end.. your brain will eventually get back to itself, it just takes time. Start taking some vitamins if you haven\u2019t already. Vitamin d, vitamin B12, magnesium.. there\u2019s one called 5-HTP that helps produce serotonin. If you do a search for \u201cvitamins to recover from meth use\u201d a whole bunch of info will pop up. Do some research.  You\u2019ve got this! Good luck in your recovery \ud83d\ude42",
        "rejected_target": " Not a doctor but I'm in recovery. Like others have said, this is pretty normal to feel a  \"pink cloud\" after getting sober, once you get over the physical symptoms. Once the nice new feelings start to go away, many people head back into their addiction to bring those highs again. I would strongly recommend a 12 step program or seeing a mental health professional to set yourself up for success. Congratulations and I'm so happy to hear you're feeling good!"

    "\n\nHuman: My father (M/60) died of COVID complications in the ER on Oct 23rd. The funeral home has still not been able to get a doc to sign the death certificate. Is this normal? My father had poor health in general and honestly wasn't expected to live long even without Covid. But he was admitted to the ER on the 21st and died early on the 23rd.  The same day I had him transferred to the funeral home, and got all the payment and paperwork done. As of this past Monday the woman at the funeral home told me that one doctor refused to sign the death certificate, and they were waiting to hear from another person at the hospital. I have never heard of this, and asked if that was normal. She told me because he died in the ER (which was a surprise to me, because when I spoke to the nurses before his death they had moved him to a room) it was not abnormal. As of today they still don't have a doc to sign the death certificate.   Is this a normal thing? Should I call the hospital myself?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: [25F] Can't execute multiple-step thinking. Can't verbally spell out words over 4-5 letters. Can't transcribe words when spoken to me if they are longer than 4-5 letters (i.e. a last name I\u2019m supposed to input into a database.) Basically, minimal short-term memory. Possibly a learning disability? Height: 5'4  Weight: 130  Gender: F  Race: White  Medications: none currently, most recent ones were risperidone and lamictal. Discontinued about six months ago due to lack of substantial results with no major emotional changes as a result.  Smoking status: vape often. About a juul pod a day.  Previous medical issues: mentioned below. Few different diagnoses over the years. ADHD first (childhood), then they added major depressive disorder (~2015). In 2018, they both got thrown out and replaced with Bipolar II.   Duration of complaint: Always, really. I feel like it wasn't as bad in elementary school, or maybe it just wasn't something I was really bothered by/aware of. By middle/high school, it was definitely noticeable to me.  Complaint:  I consistently test above average academically. I hate even saying that, but it\u2019s relevant to this concern. I learn easily, I understand easily, I remember LONG-term easily.  I cannot input a debit/credit card number recited to me into our work database if they don\u2019t pause in between groups of numbers. I cannot record a last name or an unfamiliar word down if it isn\u2019t spelled out to me both slowly and a few letters at a time. I absolutely CANNOT verbally spell, though spelling isn\u2019t a problem at all when writing. I cannot visually interpret XYZ grids whatsoever, and I\u2019m proficient at math. I also can\u2019t do division or multiplication in my head. Addition/subtraction over two places is also incredibly difficult if any numbers need to be carried.  Essentially, any thinking process where I have to go past three, maybe four small steps at a time, I forget where I\u2019m at entirely and have to start all over. It\u2019s like my RAM is nearly non-existent. Everything I do on paper works out great because it can\u2019t disappear- it\u2019s permanently on the page. Anything requiring on-the-spot, short-term memory? Forget it... literally.  I have a childhood diagnosis of ADHD. Got diagnosed with major depressive disorder around 21. After a major depressive episode/suicidal issue a few years after that, my psychiatrist shifted my diagnosis/medication to bipolar II. This diagnostic shift was predicated on an event I described when I was 18, where after a traumatic life event (first major death of a loved one), I had a solid month of extremely erratic, reckless and very uncharacteristic behavior combined with a lack of sleep or need/desire for it. Fit every definition I've read of a manic episode, and the age was appropriate for symptoms to start. I haven't had one since, however.   I stopped taking these bipolar medications around six months ago because they weren\u2019t very effective for me in general and I felt they were making focusing on schoolwork even more difficult (caused me to feel lethargic, emotionally numb, sleepy, disinterested, etc. Common side effects.) I definitely have long-standing depression issues, but no present mania or hypomania. I occasionally get bursts of energy/feeling 'up'/overconfidence, but they usually last anywhere from 1-6 hours before they go away entirely. Never days at a time since that manic episode at 18.  I haven\u2019t found anything that falls beneath the scope of either ADHD or bipolar to explain this. Doctors and my past mental health team sort of brushed it off in the face of treating my depression. I just want to know what this specifically is. It feels bigger than just the symptoms described. It\u2019s like I can feel my brain hit some weird wall whenever I try to think steps or moves ahead.  Speaking of which, I\u2019ll throw in one last example. Cannot do strategy games like chess. I just lose my future plans two imagined steps in. They can\u2019t be recalled; they just disappear.  Is this (maybe) a learning disability? What am I (potentially) dealing with?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Not a doctor, but in an incredibly similar situation and feel I may have some somewhat relevant insight. I have been medicated for bipolar for years, and I got a full neuropsychological evaluation when my doctor first suspected I had ADD as well. While I also tested very well in other areas of intelligence, they ended up concluding I have ADD with what they referred to as \"slow processing speed\"- I find it very hard for me to sort through information that is coming in \"too fast\" (i.e., someone speaking to me at a normal pace). Based off of your post this seems to be a big source of frustration for you as well. Medication (Adderall) has helped me immensely, but I also have made a habit of constantly keeping notes. Generally that means just writing down all the bits I catch the first time around really quickly before I can forget them, then asking questions to fill in the gaps.  I don't want to project, but I know that I personally struggle with feeling like people think I'm dumber than I am because of this setback. It's frustrating to know that I'm generally quite capable, but on the surface can seem so slow (and often that's the first and only impression people get of me). I just hope that you don't fall into the trap of believing you're less smart/capable than you really are- it's all just a matter of adapting, and you'll be able to use your intelligence in other areas to help balance out. Best of luck and please don't get too down on yourself! :)  Edit: Just saw a mention of auditory processing disorder in another comment and wanted to add that I have been diagnosed with that as well- it's related to the ADD, and makes absorbing information given to me verbally very difficult (and, again, slow!) Just something else to consider!",

    "\n\nHuman: [23M] I keep losing weight unintentionally. My fear is cancer. Background: Hello, I\u2019m a 23 year old male. I\u2019m 6 feet tall and currently weigh 150lbs. I don\u2019t take any medications currently. I also have beta thalassemia  minor.    Symptoms: Over the last 3.6 years I have lost 30lbs effortlessly. And I continue to gradually lose more weight. In the last 6 months or so it seems like I lost 4-5 pounds.   I also have other symptoms that began abruptly 3.6 years ago such as diarrhea/ loose/oily stools and going multiple times throughout the day. I\u2019m also experiencing loss of appetite, fatigue(I can sleep 10 hours and still feel tired) and random bouts of stabbing abdominal pain in my stomach area (1 inch left and 1 inch above my belly button). Finally, I\u2019ve had two weird symptoms that just seem very mysterious and puzzling. First is my throat/ esophagus. It feels like food gets stuck in my throat/esophagus. I also have pain when I swallow and sometimes I cough out bloody mucus in the morning from my throat. My second weird symptom is peripheral neuropathy. I have constant nerve pain through my limbs that feel akin to electric shocks.   Here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019ve been to a few doctors. They all seem puzzled about my symptoms and chalk it up as IBS because my blood tests return mostly normal results every single time.  I\u2019ve been told that I can\u2019t have IBD because my C Reactive protein is normal.   However, I say mostly normal because I do have elevated calcium.   So my question is this, is it possible to have a cancer/neoplasm even if my recent CBC and metabolic panel are mostly normal if I\u2019ve had symptoms in the last 3.6 years?  Surely if  this was a gastrointestinal malignancy it would have spread to my liver by now and would have showed up in my metabolic panel via elevated ALT/AST, right?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Go see a GI doctor. You're pretty young for GI cancer so don't just assume that's what it is. IBS doesn't fit. Could be IBD, pancreatic insufficiency, weight loss from not eating (if you're having trouble swallowing), etc. You can absolutely have IBD with a normal CRP, but if it were actively flaring or causing major symptoms it should be elevated, yes.  I cannot say because I have not seen all your blood tests or done a physical exam on you, but you might need an upper endoscopy (EGD). Again, that's up to your doctors, who have physically seen you.     >Surely if this was a gastrointestinal malignancy it would have spread to my liver by now and would have showed up in my metabolic panel via elevated ALT/AST, right?        Not necessarily.",

            " My first thought was gallstones complicated by malabsorption and biliary pancreatitis. Bear with me here:  1. Thalassemia means increased red cell breakdown, which means increased bilirubin excreted into the gallbladder via the bile ducts.  2. Increased bilirubin in the gallbladder leads to gallstones.  3. Gallstones move into and block the bile duct.  4. Bile doesn't enter the bowel, leading to failure of fat absorption and fatty stools.   5. Fat soluble vitamin deficiencies follow. Vitamin E deficiency can cause peripheral neuropathy. Vitamin K deficiency causes bleeding.  6. The bile duct stones block the common opening with the pancreatic duct into the bowel.  7. Backflow of pancreatic digestive enzymes causes inflammation and destruction of the pancreas, causing stomach pain.   8. Pancreatic insufficiency worsens digestive deficits, including protein and carbohydrate digestison, leading to possible iron and B12 deficiency.  9. Iron or B12 deficiency can cause webs in the esophagus, resulting in difficulty getting food down.  This is just an attempt to use Occam's razor and explain your symptoms with the fewest assumptions. But it's entirely possible that you have different conditions causing your many symptoms.  What's worrying is the coughing up blood. Is it from the airway or from the gastrointestinal tract? Either way, it's a worrying symptom to be investigated.   My second thought is disseminated tuberculosis (chances are you're in TB endemic South Asia if you have thalassemia):  - Tall, lanky males have a disproportionate TB risk.  - TB can cause fever, cough, weight and appetite loss and night sweats. Do you have any of these you didn't mention?  -TB in the lungs can erode a vessel and cause bloody cough.  - TB likes the terminal ileum, where B12 is absorbed.   - B12 deficiency can cause esophageal webs and peripheral neuropathy.   P.s. Interesting case. Post a follow up.",
            " Not a doctor, but my first guess would be Chron's disease. That amount of weight loss isn't necessarily drastic at that rate but the weakness along with it and the pains sound very in line with Chron's. The throat symptoms sound unrelated, though. I've been experiencing a tight throat/lump like something is stuck and after freaking out for a few days and researching, I decided it's anxiety related (which turns into a vicious cycle).",

    "\n\nHuman: Why do I smell honey after I sneeze? I sneeze a lot. It's a thing that runs in the family, my father and grandfather all have sneezing fits. On average I sneeze around 40 times a day, usually in three round bursts, sometimes up to 10 times in a row.   Lately though I've noticed after I sneeze it smells sweet, and almost like honey. This has been going on for about 2 months now. My girlfriend once in awhile can even smell it. Why is this happening?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Well...I'm not a doctor. But I do have Type 1 diabetes. And I do have sneezing fits.   First, I just have to say that I'm so glad you posted this! I don't know anyone else who has sneezing fits. My record is 14 in a row, and it hurts my chest SO bad when I have that many. I'm glad to know that I'm not alone in that weirdness!   As to the scent -- I get that too. For me it's closer to maple syrup, but that's still not quite right...I'm not sure how to describe it. But it smells sweet and delicious. No one around me has ever smelled the same thing, so far as I know.   My blood sugar is usually well-controlled. But when I smell the sweet scent, if I take my blood sugar right then, it's usually a little higher than normal. Not much, but enough that I pump an insulin unit to compensate.   So with that said -- I agree with the other posters about getting tested for diabetes. Alternatively, you might buy a cheap blood sugar tester and test yourself when you have the sneezing fits, just to see what you get. Your doctor would like to have that information when you do go in with your concerns.   Good luck!",

    "\n\nHuman: I (m22) am 3 days into testing positive for covid. I am completely asymptomatic and still have taste and smell. Is it safe for me to resume smoking/dry herb vaping marijuana. I had a PCR test come back positive that was taken on Friday, I\u2019m 22 and in good health and have no underlying conditions. Am I safe?   I can go without but I\u2019m stuck in my room and it would help pass the time especially since I cannot spend any time with my family for thanksgiving.  My nurse practitioner said that symptoms probably would\u2019ve shown up by now, but I forgot to ask this question as I was more worried about asking about precautions to take around my family in the same house as me.  I use it for anxiety disorder, depression and appetite stimulant. Thanks!\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Update to Previous Post Regarding Cough Up Blood After Workout. Results Were Surprising    Age: 31  Sex: M  Height: 6'6\"  Weight: 250 Athletic  Race: White/Caucasian  Duration: 4 1/2 Months  Location: Lungs/Upper Respiratory, Upper G/I  Current Diagnosis: **Stage 4 Aggressive Gastro-Intestinal Cancer**  Current Meds: Pain Killers, Diuretics  As needed Meds: Lidocaine Patches, Anti-Nausea,  M**elatonin** sleep aid  Original:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/c2ls61/chronic\\_cough\\_and\\_now\\_coughing\\_up\\_blood\\_after/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&utm\\_source=share   So after spending some time at an Urgent Care, getting some scans lined up and trying to be patient, I woke up one morning to pain and compression over my chest. Urgent Care Docs had advised me that any escalation of symptoms should mean I go to the Emergency Room. Once there they almost immediately checked me into the ICU for observation and began running every test you could name. For the next 4/5 days I did just an unreal number of scans, 2 biopsies, and they drew enough blood to fill a small pool. Pain escalated daily while there so finding a solution was a running theme. So after a lot of trails here's what they found:  Current: Stage 4 Aggressive Metastatic Gastrointestinal Cancer ( Adenocarcinoma )  Previous: Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation   After doing a Lymph Node & Bone Marrow Biopsy they found my marrow filled to capacity with dead cancer cells. This pointed them in the right direction. My platelets were crashing daily (20,000 at admission) and I've got inflamed lymph nodes throughout my chest cavity which is one source of my (significant and at time escalating) pain. Its infiltrated my lungs and several vertebrae along my spine (causing vertebrae to show signs of Osteopenia) . Weirdly enough there's no noticeable tumor/mass/lump they can trace it back to. It's kind of just spread throughout (described as Adenocarcinoma) , though they were finally able to locate a small ulcer in my stomach that allowed them to finally be able to classify it. I've currently just completed my 3rd (now weekly) round of chemo (we started asap when other options such as clinical trials were deemed a non-option) and we've been able to stabilize a number of things (blood factors such as platelets, hemoglobin and the like) along the way. Many of my blood counts are still in the trash so clinical trails are not currently an option. In early stages of my 3 weeks hospital visit I was in a state called **DIC (**Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) which caused me to act like something akin to a blood squirt gun if i bled. Essentialy it screws with you clotting factors and any bleeding event is an issue. Any procedure became an issue and many my numbers were artifically raised in order to attempt anything that would cause me to bleed. Fortunately after a week of treatments and what felt like several wheel barrows of infusions we kicked my body out of D.I.C and am more or less clotting normally. Fun story: early one morning after the vampires took their daily does of my blood a CNA came in to do a routine vitals check. This particular morning they took 2 unique sets of blood samples plus a rather large sample for testing against infectious disease. This was also kind of at the height of my \"he's not clotting\" phase. During the blood pressure check it popped open all the fresh holes in my arm, causing them to bleed and freaked/surprised the CNA. Made me laugh. (end of story).  Immunotherapy is what my Oncologist are banking on right now so crossing my fingers. Chemo is causing reasonable progress (numbers are low but stable) so we're staying the course for now. My personal mid->long term goal is to find an alternative to opiates for pain management (who the hell knows why a person tolerates opiates for a buzz cause constipation sucks!!!) so looking at alternatives (THC pills potentially or preferably resolving the issue that's causing me pain)  I've been discharged from the hospital after 3 weeks so now I'm working to find a routine that works. Losing weight so a short term goal is stopping that (I'm rather tall and (was) muscular so my bodies nuking whatever calories I put in and I'm not putting in a lot due to general nausea, but smoothies have been my friend. Please let me know if you have any questions or advice.. I'll answer what I can and absorb what reasonable advice I read.\n\nAssistant:": {

Colace, stool softeners, the like can help. During chemo I recommend ginger chews for nausea btw. And of course the miracle of Zofran which you are probably already on.    THC may or may not work, it depends on the person really. It's worth a try and I also second the Marinol suggestion below.  There is also cannabis patches which could help, especially if you have slow gastric transit due to the opioids.",

            " Not a doctor, and I'm really sorry to hear about your diagnosis and wish you the best of luck on remission. As far as the pain meds/thc goes, I have lupus and a lot of chronic pain from it and related issues, opiates don't help the pain and I avoid them entirely. Prednisone is the best pain reliever for me but that's because it helps the underlying problem, and I do take NSAIDs as well, but thc has been a significant part of my pain regimen too. I will warn you it doesn't actually take away pain, like almost at all, instead, it makes it easier to handle the same level of pain, which is still useful. The side effects are also much more tolerable than opiates, and it would likely help with your appetite and nausea as well. That being said, if you live in a legal or medical state, obviously you should avoid smoking, get some RSO and start off slow and low, it goes a long way. RSO is full extract but be sure to check that there is at least some CBD in there which can help avoid the anxious freakouts if you take too much. If you need any advice on that matter feel free to PM me. Best of luck to you, friend, hang in there",

            " OOF. (forgot to add Not a doctor) Welcome to the club friend. Stage 4 cancer fucking sucks but it isn't always a death sentence. I was diagnosed w/ stage 4 synovial sarcoma in 2017 (with more specific parameters that made my odds even less than stellar.. my primary site was 14.5cm at diagnosis!). Don't give up until you have to, we have more options than ever before. Support groups for your specific type of cancer (or as close as you can get to your specific subtype) are an incredible blessing and wealth of information. Infusions are great energy boosters, though, aren't they? ;) lol. I'm assuming the 2 samples were for blood cultures? It always looks like they are taking a shit ton even though they aren't. If you can get into an immunotherapy trial, DO IT. I was SO CLOSE to one but they wouldn't accept me as I was out of state with an insurance that would cover nothing. Alternatives for opiates is hard, I would go for straight up vaping medical grade marijuana if you can access it, my oncologists and palliative have both not so subtly told me \"off the record\" that they prefer that over prescribing the \"pot pill,\" and it's not acceptable in my state either, they just turn a blind eye to it. I haven't done it this round of chemo, but it was the only way I was able to deal with it the first time (I was on much harsher stuff back then, probably similar to the hell I imagine you're dealing with (was AIM plus votrient if you're wondering)). Miralax is personally my favorite to help with constipation. It's mild enough that I never get diarrhea from it and that was a big issue with other laxatives. As long as I take it every day, everything stays moving. I did a lot of slushies and milkshakes. Making smoothies with the meal replacement drinks can help a ton (I personally think the chocolate boost tastes the best and boost is leaps better than ensure). Try different brands and different flavors. The hospital nutritionists didn't care if I didn't eat as long as I had the replacement crap. I am doing instant breakfast (the powder type) this time since I can tolerate milk. If you have mouth pain asking your doctor to write you a prescription for \"magic mouthwash\" can help, but it can be hard to get it filled nowadays as most pharmacies won't mix a compounded formula. I unfortunately had severe mouth and throat swelling from it xD but the mouth pain passed for me.  I would also like to add that being a young adult dealing with this poses it's own mental challenges. I'm quite a bit younger than you are (22 when I was diagnosed), so that is probably part of the struggle I've had, but I lost my entire support network apart from family. As of right now, I only have 3 friends that I knew before I was diagnosed. The people I thought would never leave me did, and other people surprised me by how unwavering they have been. It's extremely hard not to take it personal, but some people just don't know how to deal with someone close to them going through cancer. It isn't your fault. You are allowed to grow and change as a person. It is NOT okay for people to expect you to go through this without changing at all. It's impossible not to change in some way and grow as a person imo. I was less apt to let people walk all over me afterward. I often joke that cancer stole my ability to run but gave me a spine. HA.     If you are under-insured, and there is a teaching hospital near you, they will often cover excess costs (and usually they run the majority of clinical trials, anyway). I didn't have insurance at all when I was diagnosed and the hospital covered treatment and helped me apply for disability. The American Cancer Society has a lot of resources, but most people have local resources near them as well that others might not know about! We had a local organization give us gift cards to gas stations since I had people with time to take me, we just didn't have the gas money. There are also organizations that will help with medication costs.   Good luck on your journey! I am so glad you went and got this figured out so you can start fighting it. Hopefully one day soon both of us can say we're done and put this shit behind us. But until then if you need anything, feel free to message me.

    "\n\nHuman: Period blood is pouring out of me 24F, Caucasian, 116 lbs, 5\u20198\u201d, non-smoker, quit drinking in July, never been sexually active, went off BC (to control hormones) almost year ago due to clotting concerns (family history of multiple strokes), yes I am anemic. Current medications: Ondanestron, Wixela, iron supplements, Vitamin B,C supplements. Also, just had blood work done and thyroid panel and CBC all came back normal. Yesterday was the worst day I\u2019ve ever experienced having a period. I soaked through 3 tampons in just under four hours. Decided to full stop the tampons and put a pad on, whilst doing that decided I need to use the restroom. To my surprise, instead of urine, blood poured out of me for a good ten seconds. I\u2019m not just talking a little bit, I\u2019m talking if you stood over the toilet with a full glass of water and poured it all out. When that was done, I wiped and was met with a clot the size of almost a golf ball. I\u2019ve never had a period like this before. I have no energy, the blood coming out is not a familiar consistency of periods past, and I\u2019m feeling so nauseous and fatigued. I\u2019m calling on Monday to schedule a gynecologist appointment, but would like to hear opinions on what this sounds like to others.\n\nAssistant:": {

My iron dropped I would sleep for 3 days and couldn't go to work. On my moms side of the family every women has gotten uterine cancer after 30 including my older sister, my mom, all my aunts and my grandma. I'm 27 right now and decided to try the IUD hormone one bc it decreases your risk of uterine cancer and stops periods ect. I got it in January of 2019. Hormones were a bitch the first 2 3 months but after about 6 months my period stopped for a yr and now I only get very light spotting once a month for a day sometimes every other month and I still get the cramps and fatigue but its not as severe. I have always had heavy periods and started getting my period at 9/10 yrs old. I have tried multiple birth control pills, the arm bar thing and the shot with no success with controlling bleeding and lots of side effects. I had 2 children and after my second things got worse.  You could look into the mirena IUD. Some people don't have success but its definitely worth a try. If the IUD stops working for some reason or starts giving me issues im gonna try and get a partial hysterectomy bc I can't have anymore kids from getting my tubes tied.  Good luck",

    "\n\nHuman: Young person with odor from open wounds Hi. I work with teens and have one child, 17yo male, 6'4\", 380 lbs, who had an infection on his neck for several months (possibly a year). Doctors have him a few rounds of antibiotics to no avail. He then had surgery which was not successful. They did a second, more invasive surgery and it's gotten much better, but one side is still oozing, painful, and warm to the touch.   He was tested for diabetes but it came back negative. Since the second surgery, he's gotten numerous open sores on his belly and upper legs. He said they look like blisters and then pop. Then, they remain open. They are deep/wide enough that a q-tip can be inserted.   Other staff and I have noticed an odor coming from the young man. We've talked to him about it and he started showering at least twice a day and cleans the wounds when he can. The smell got better but it's still noticeable and it is definitely coming from the wounds. He is still on antibiotics.   He has an appointment with an immunologist in 3 weeks, but I'm concerned he's going to get sepsis. Any idea what's going on? He lives in an impoverished neighborhood and I'm concerned his doctors aren't taking it seriously enough. He often has to go to the emergency room to get medical attention.  Any advice that I could pass on would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAssistant:": {

I wasn't that invested in my project (sustainable plastics, but it was very fundamental characterization-based work).  But I did it. Now I work in food science, and while the pay isn't as good as MSE or MechE, I really love it. I'm also doing work that I'm qualified for, I use a lot of the instruments I learned how to use in grad school, and I am using advanced characterization to support product teams and manufacturing in some of the more complex issues they encounter.  It was worth it for me, but not economically. I got a stipend but wasn't able to save much money during grad school, getting a job right out of undergrad I would have made more over a longer time period. It depends on the field and the company, but typically you won't make that much more as a PhD than a masters.  It was worth it for me because I grew a lot during my PhD, it's the first thing I ever did in my life that truly challenged me and pushed me WAY outside my comfort zone. I really enjoy the work I'm doing now and there's absolutely no way I would be in my current position without my grad school experience.  My advice would be to go in after you figure out what kind of project you want, possibly after working first. If you approach grad school and apply based on a professor that interests you, a specific project, etc. you will probably get way more out of the experience.",
            " Totally! Work in industry running a multimillion dollar per year R&D program with state of the art labs and equipment.   Getting the degree was great as well, got to learn the real guts of science and research things that interested me. It was a good mental challenge as I had always been bored with school up till I started work in my major. I still look back at grad school as the best experience of my professional career.   Plenty of work for PhD drones that are good workers but not creative or leaders. But if you can stand out and really perform there are some great positions out there where you have a lot of freedom to operate."

I do my best to train BS/MS holders to do my sort of job, because I don't think there's anything I did that *needed* the degree, but it is a shortcut guarantee of getting the kinds of jobs you get with a PhD vs gambling on luck with your career with a MS."

    "\n\nHuman: Got some harsh feedback from my manager, seeking advice Hi guys, I'm a senior in college majoring in EE. I was working at an internship at a pretty big company over the summer. Almost everyone in my team had a Master's and 10+ years of experience vs me who was experiencing their first time in the industry.  I did think my project was way out of my knowledge level but I did think I was learning a lot over the summer. My manager and team essentially gave me feedback that they really enjoyed working with me and that I have the eagerness to learn but I constantly needed their help and don't have much technical prowess and they can't do much hand-holding. Idk, is this not how internships were supposed to be like?  It just took a major hit on my confidence and he also said I wouldn't be getting a return offer after graduating. I told him that I would be open to other positions in the company that need less experience, and he told me that other ppl have been asking about me but he has to be honest and mention my weaknesses. While I do agree with him that I did lack a bit of fundamental knowledge but am I being judged a little too hard for this? I've been doing well in school but the industry design game was wayyy more complicated than anything i've seen in school? I am glad he gave me the feedback because its important I knew but how do I be better in the industry? I want to use this as motivation and improve my skills. Seeking advice and others opinions, and how to get my confidence back lol?  Sorry for being a bit over the place. Thanks!\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Your boss sounds like a dick.  Newly graduated EE's require a bit of handholding.  Interns require even more.  If they expected someone with technical prowess that didn't require any handholding, they should have hired and PAID for an EE with actual experience.    In my opinion, the best trait you can look for in an intern is \"willingness to learn\" with \"didn't blow up any expensive lab equipment\" a close second.    When our team has an intern, the intern usually get a week or so of shadowing and people telling them about the project, what we need them to do, etc.  They usually have a person who is their main point of contact.  They check in every couple of mornings, help prioritize the work for the day, etc.  That point contact and the rest of the team is available for questions and help within reason.    If you're constantly running to people for help on problems that you haven't even tried out yourself first, yeah that's gonna annoy people.  But stopping by someone's desk and saying \"Hey, before I start this task, can you give me a quick rundown on it first\" is fine.  If you really need some one-on-one help, I'd like to hear \"Hey, I'm supposed to get X done but I'm running into trouble.  I tried Y and Z but that didn't pan out.  Could I put 30 minutes on your calendar so we can meet up in the lab and try to help me figure out where I'm going wrong?\"  If you're not sure how to use an expensive piece of equipment that would be a situation where I'd prefer you come to me sooner rather than later asking for help.  I don't really have a ton of expectations for interns other than that they should be interested in the work (hopefully), eager to learn, are ok with trying and failing, asking for help when they really need it, etc.  We've had interns that just kinda did what you asked them to do, got stuff done and that was that.  We've also had interns that jumped in and came up with novel solutions that we had't thought of before.  I would consider both those intern groups \"successful\".",

Some companies just operate with more senior teams, where they expect/are used to people pulling their weight, and aren\u2019t accustomed to inexperienced interns, and someone in HR told them they needed to hire one. Most companies like to expose the intern to a variety of things on how the company operates, so that if they decide to make them an offer full time, the intern will be a step ahead of another new hire. Also, this works like a sort of trial period where both parties can have sort of an extended interview of each other.

            " I've worked at 5 or 6 companies now (I'm an oldster), and what I can tell you is that it is completely random how much companies put into training and bringing people along.  Some companies seem to value it culturally, and there's no way you would have made it through a whole internship without feedback to guide you along, and then get \"voted off the island\" at the end like that.  However, some companies are clueless when it comes to growing people, and they only hire self-starter rock stars (often jerks), and play a massive game of sink-or-swim with you.  These companies, in short, suck hairy ball sacks, and not just because they don't know how to grow people.  They don't **value** growing people, which tends to show up in lots of other ways (they're always last in terms of adopting industry perks, they tend to have a$$hole leaders who drive people into the ground, they tend to have stupid HR policies that everybody hates but nobody does anything about, etc.)  During the interview process if someone says something like \"we're a work hard / play hard company\" that's a red flag.  Ask the interviewer to explain what they mean, because *often* what it means is that they're a \"sink-or-swim\" company, which can be tough when you're just starting out.  Maybe eventually you might like that kind of pace, but it's not good for interns or people early in their career.  The problem is, it's really tough to know which kind of company you're talking to, especially early in your career where you don't know people.  I might suggest contacting a head hunter or  consulting firm in your area.  Explain to them that you're not looking right now because you're still in school, but you would really value a sit down for coffee where you could discuss the companies in your area and what their culture is like.  You might have to go through a couple before you find someone who's interested in \"wasting\" their time with a student, but I bet you can find someone who's got half an hour to sit down and have coffee with a young'un and shoot the breeze.    I don't know for sure, because we don't have any details of what happened from your post, but it *sounds* like you landed in a shop full of a$$holes.

And the most important thing during those phases is if we can click and work together  I may not have time to make a model for a special ECU adaptation at times due to audits, recalls, product launches etc but your skills from college and our guidance can certainly help. And I won't mind if you ask some repeat questions along the way."

    "\n\nHuman: I do almost zero work at my new engineering job, should I bring it up to my boss? Fresh out of school with a degree in mechanical engineering. I work for a company with maybe 200 employees at our location and maybe 9 engineers. I\u2019ve been working here for about a month and probably have about 10 hours of real work to due each week. I try to stay busy and find work for myself but its starting to get annoying. I understand I\u2019m new and if everyone is busy they don\u2019t have enough time to train me, however I feel like I am very underutilized. The work environment is incredibly nice, best place I have worked yet, everyone is friendly and it\u2019s a privately owned company. How do I address this issue? Thanks!\n\nAssistant:": {

These notations and drawing standards vary from company to company but are more or less the same for the last 100 years. I can look at drawings from the 1920's and know exactly how the building is constructed, etc. For steel frame, the drawings will denote standard Wide Flange Shapes which are manufactured in a standardized process and can be found in applicable manuals. For concrete, rebar sizes, standards etc are all standardized and specified in codes. The GC (general contractor) will typically subcontract firms that specialize in those trades. Lets start from the foundation up.   The GC will hire a firm that specializes in earth moving and soil preparation.  The firm will have foreman, supers who have presumably been doing this for years and are teaching younger leadsman and laborers how to read the geotechnical report and comply with the geotechnical requirements.  The firm(s) might even have a university educated project engineer/project manager also familiar with the technical specifications.   Moving to the foundation, the GC will hire a firm that does rebar and concrete work. They are familiar with rebar standards, specifications and code and will fabricate and create shop drawings in compliance with the structural engineers specifications.   Moving to columns, if the structure is concrete that same firm who worked on the foundation may work on the columns. But lets assume its a steel building. the GC will hire a trade that again specializes in steel work. Foreman/Supers doing steel for their careers. In my part of the US, we often defer simple connection design to the steel fabricator too. The steel fabricator will have a engineer in house that designs the building connections (for simple ones). He or she will be a registered P.E.   This process repeats for each trade until the building structure is completed. There are specific trades too for architectural components and mechanical/electrical/plumbing.   Ultimately it comes down to standardization, codes, and regulations.

            " Sticking to drawing standards. The drawing standard is the language of symbols and formats. This symbol means this type of weld. The engineer and the construction worker should speak the same language. When there is ambiguity or mistakes in the drawings, the constructor will ask a question to the engineer in the form of a Request for Information (RFI). There is also a quality control department that checks that what the constructor built is the same as what's on the drawing.  With that said, those large projects are in fact very complex so the construction company will have a whole system of processing, organizing, and reviewing the drawings before they actually get into the hand of the person with the hammer. The engineering company might be a pyramid of people and the construction company will also be a pyramid.  In practice, constructors often identify mistakes on the drawing and have enough experience to sometimes say \"are you sure you meant this?\". On the flip side, they sometimes say they can't build the drawing even though they could if they tried. You may have a second constructor or supervisor that checks that what was built matches the drawing. As said before, a quality department will also do this.",

I'm 10 months into my first engineering job and I'm completely burnt out.  I got into engineering because I like solving problems.  Running experiments, analyzing data, and making decisions based on that data has always come naturally to me.  I just can't keep up with all of the issues I'm running into as a new engineer and in the last 10 months of working as a process engineer, there hasn't been one hour of one day that I haven't felt completely overwhelmed and in over my head.  Every day I deal with new fires that come up in MRB and am expected to do these root cause analysis projects on them all.  At this point, I have 5 long-term projects and about 8 short-term RCA projects that I'm having to juggle around daily manufacturing issues.  I'm not getting anything done and upper management is getting frustrated with the lack of progress, but I'm just completely overwhelmed.    On top of that, I was thrown into a new daily role of making formulation changes to our base material with zero training and no engineering passdown (I have an entire post about this already).  Even when I can get the properties in spec, the operators are complaining that it isn't good enough.  I'm trying so hard to get this figured out and in 2 months I haven't had one day where everything worked.    Is it supposed to be like this?  Am I just not good enough at handling the workload that an engineer can expect?  I don't know what I'll do with myself if I can't continue to be an engineer, but at this point I just can't keep going.  Did I really work so hard to get here just to fail?\n\nAssistant:": {

If they start slamming you on performance reviews then you can point at those reports and request specific guidance on where and how they want you to improve. \"Just work faster\" is not an acceptable criticism, they need specifics.  Be objective with them, and dont break yourself in an attempt to prove your worth. They already decided you were worth something when they hired you, so stick to that.

From someone in a similar situation, albeit with a few more years in the game, speak out, ask for priorities and work those as a to-do list, if nobody can give you priorities then make your own and be confident enough to say what's achievable, if management don't agree with your opinion of what's \"achievable\" and want to use you as a scapegoat then GTFO and use it as a CV enhancer."

    "\n\nHuman: 4 years after graduation, still havent found a job. would getting a masters help? Hi,  I got my BS in EE from a third world country (although its recognized internationally via WES/Engineers Australia/Washington Accord). I have a year's worth of internship experience although most of it was administrative/data entry/excel. But then I moved to Australia on a skilled visa to look for experience but the environment here , for entry level jobs and internships, is just like back home with extra hurdles of being a migrant and facing trust issues from employers due to my temporary visa (ironically they need a permanent visa for a graduate job but need you to hold a job in order to qualify you for a permanent visa).   I lost my savings coming here, im stuck doing manual labor and i feel scammed. Would getting a masters (im trying for Germany and USA) help make up for 4 years of doing nothing but job search? How do i explain this gap on my resume? Please advise. Thank you.\n\nAssistant:": {

Sure US and GE has more credited degree and education organisation will better recognize your pervious study, but the legal, culture and most importantly the electrical chartering professional system (IET) and practice is different.

    "\n\nHuman: Are car A/C systems more efficient on recirculate? Recently graduated ME here, so bear with me as I think through something.   So as you blow air over the cold, low pressure side of the loop, the heat would typically increase the pressure on that side. The work of the compressor goes to maintaining that pressure differential so that this side stays low, so blowing cooler air over these coils makes the compressors work easier, since it doesn't work against the pressure differential as much.   But it seems like with a real compressor, it would work the other way around, since it seems harder push against a higher pressure, which the cooler air would be helping to maintain.   Is there a flaw in my logic here? I've been preoccupied with this for a while now, and I'm a groomsman in a wedding right now and should probably get this off my mind.\n\nAssistant:": {

I always figured engineers would have set tasks or projects they would have to complete by a deadline. Is it a good thing that I have this much freedom? Should I be getting told what projects I need to work on?  Here are some details about my situation: I worked here as an intern while pursuing my mechanical engineering degree. As a typical intern I was hired to just sit there, make copies and get signatures from time to time. Being bored, I decided to start a project on the manufacturing floor on my own. It actually became super successful and doubled the revenue per month through that department. After graduating, I was hired immediately.  After starting my new role, I was never really told what my job function or responsibilities were. My main daily tasks involve sending out reports about workers efficiency, work on some of the projects I have thought up, and go to other people\u2019s meetings. After getting hired, I haven\u2019t really contributed anything to the company. Non of my current projects are turning up good results. It is starting to get really hard to come up with new ideas for projects. I\u2019m also getting really bored an burned out.

            " As a new engineer, yes, you should be getting more direction on what to work on.  Talk to your boss, explain that you could use some additional guidance for upcoming projects.  Or ask to be included in planning meetings, new product meetings, etc.",
            " If the situation you're in is true, you have THE dream job of engineers. \"Hey, wanna come work here and solve problems when they interest you?\" Having worked in the field as a technician for years, you've fucking made it my friend. Your absolute LAST step should be going to management and asking what they want you to work on. They hired you to identify problems and solve them, not to have you pester them for trivial work to do that they don't even know how to identify. Go out and talk to the people doing the process. Find out what they hate and fix it. Find out what takes 4 steps and make it 3. Find the maintenance procedure that requires 10 hours and make it 4. Again, as a former field guy, I'm 100% sure you have some parts that were engineered to be awesome, but a ton of manpower and cost could be saved in replacement/maintenance by identifying or creating a small change. Find the part that fails the most and figure out why, then find or make an alternative.",

Upon realizing that our manufacturing processes were inefficient (not sure why it took them that long, it was about as subtle as a brick to the head) and correctly asserting that the design engineers were too busy to focus on it, they hired on a beginner industrial/manufacturing engineer with only the flimsiest of job descriptions (which I helped his boss write at the last minute before his interview). He's spent his first handful of weeks here having to create work for himself since nobody is really equipped to give him much direction, so he's just kinda poured himself into learning everything about our industry and working on what projects he can.

            " Wiki definition reference is good enough for me:   In 1961, the Conference of Engineering Societies of Western Europe  and the United States of America defined \"professional engineer\" as  follows:\\[6\\]   >A professional engineer is  competent by virtue of his/her fundamental education and training to  apply the scientific method and outlook to the analysis and solution of  engineering problems.

            " I had this problem at my last job; I was just told to make \"improvements\" in the manufacturing cell I was assigned to. Part of the reason I got fired was not knowing how to identify projects, so I've tried to learn since then.  A couple of the most popular toolboxes for identifying and fixing problems are Lean and 6 Sigma. You should research them on your own (there are lots of expensive courses but also lots of free books at the library), but the basic idea of Lean is to identify waste-- wasted movements, idle machines, wasted space (often too much inventory), and then some tools to fix it. Six Sigma is more about improving quality-- creating metrics, validating processes, measuring process control, and then some tools to improve them. Pareto charts can help set priorities by seeing what the most costly problems are.   Read up on those and they should give you some ideas on how to come up with projects and put them in terms that managers like. Your company may even pay for you to get Lean or 6 Sigma training/certification, which look good on a resume.",

            " This is a popular question that I don't think I've ever really tackled head-on, although elements of it have come up in previous answers of mine. A point of mild amusement: all summer long (in the northern hemisphere) we get questions about how they managed in the heat in such warm clothes, and all winter long we get questions about how they managed to keep warm in the cold.  For a start, as I explained in Why is most historical clothing so complicated? Victorian clothing was not really that \"painfully restrictive and heavily layered\". Women wore a cotton chemise with the corset over it and a pair of long drawers, then a number of starched petticoats or a hoop skirt or bustle, depending on the point in the period, and then their dress; despite the popular impression, corsets were not immobilizing or debilitating. (There were specific corsets to allow for riding horses, and eventually corsets specifically for sports; see my answer on them here.) The starch in the petticoats kept them from tangling the legs and structured skirt supports were also light and facilitated movement. Men wore a shirt with some form of lower-body underwear, trousers, a vest/waistcoat, and a coat. Is that really so much?  The very poor tended to wear clothing that was better for the summer than the winter, since the cheaper fabrics were flimsier and thinner; they had to do more work to layer up when it was cold, and would merely tend to roll up sleeves, etc. in the heat. For those who could afford to have separate wardrobes for different seasons - or even just \"a summer suit\" and \"a winter suit\" - alterations were made to clothes. Men could wear suits of lighter colors and fabrics during the summer - for instance, the stereotypical white linen suit of the Southern (American) gentleman. Someone who was not wealthy might go for something a bit more practical, like a brown serge (cotton twill) or, by the 1890s, seersucker. Women might wear gowns made of sheer cotton, silk, wool, or a blend and sleeves and bodices could be made fuller, all of which would make clothing lighter and airier. By the end of the era, there were also ventilated corsets (as described in the previous link). And in the end, if it were really, really hot, people could stay at home in partial undress.  The last part of the issue \"is more of a science answer than a history answer\": the properties of natural fibers and synthetics are such that clothing made of linen, cotton, and wool are more breathable in the summer than polyester and similar man-made fabrics. Even heavier wools can breathe, but wool can also be made in tropical weights for suits and in sheer challises and bar\u00e8ges for gowns. There is also a decent amount of anecdotal evidence from reenactors that baring more skin doesn't make much of a difference when it's 80+ degrees, that covering up to some extent reduces the heat of the sun, and that avoiding the extremes of air conditioning makes the heat less oppressive in contrast. (I have also found this to be the case, personally.)  Now to add in some examples of lighter summer clothes:  Man's white linen frock coat, 1840-1855; Augusta Auctions  \"Mrs. Adrian Bauker Holmes\" (in a white muslin gown with an open neckline), by Charles Wesley Jarvis, ca. 1850; MMA 13.21.8  Bonnet, ca. 1855; MMA 2009.300.5661 - straw was already a lighter bonnet and hat material worn in the summer to keep from insulating the head too much, and straw could be interspersed with horsehair braid for aesthetics and to let more air in  Bodice of sheer white cotton, ca. 1865; MMA 2009.300.5241  Woman's ensemble, 1864-1867; LACMA M.2007.211.944a-c and a very similar afternoon dress, ca. 1867; MFIT P90.22.2  Semisheer dress, ca. 1870; Rijksmuseum BK-1978-260  \"Spring\", by Philippe-Jacques Linder, ca. 1875; CAI 1955.792  Tennis dress, ca. 1885; LACMA M.2007.211.782a-b  (Sorry, mostly women's, I just don't stockpile the men's images as much!)",

            " I am not familiar with France, but I can give you some tidbits about Poland. This relate to Polish *occupied* territories (mainly the General Government), as opposed to territories outright *annexed* into the Reich, such as Silesia. The latter is a completely different case.  First of all, mind that the entire occupation of Poland was geared towards maximization of economic drainage. Taxation was just part of it and not even a major one. If there was ever a plunder economy, this was it in its most pure form. Among other things, the occupying power took over the control of Polish industry and its output, even if it nominally remained under native ownership. Labor was mandatory and slave labor of Poles and Jews used extensively. Natural resources were ruthlessly extracted, and negative effects of deforestation that happened back then are felt even today. More often than not, the authorities simply discarded any semblance of law and simply plundered whatever they wanted. This took many forms and ranged from localized expropriations (often conducted on private initiative of local corrupt officials) up to state-organized wholesale theft of assets, such as \"temporary\" freezing (essentially taking over) of bank accounts, forced \"exchange\" of any foreign currency and bullion or confiscation of property left by victims of the terror (which included any property of Jews murdered in Holocaust).  In this environment, taxation played a minor role. Barring some exceptions, the Germans kept pre-war Polish currency. This economically isolated Poland from the outside world, because obviously currency of an occupied territory was essentially worthless on international markets. Monetary taxation therefore did not benefit Germany as a whole. It was used mostly for the needs of local German administration, which was more than happy to run printing presses and mints whenever it needed some more cash on hand. Although taxation was much higher on average than in pre-war Poland, it was nevertheless kept on a level relatively moderate by today's standards. I encountered a figure of 30% of an average income tax, though I am unable to verify whether that's *median* taxation. There was also a poll tax, a carryover from previous Polish taxation system. On top of those ordinary taxes, German authorities often introduced local *extraordinary* taxes which could've take any form. Such taxes were often used as punitive measures for perceived disobedience or for some especially shocking actions of the Polish underground. For example, a massive extraordinary bulk tribute (and hostages to ensure its timely payment) was levied upon the city of Warsaw after the underground assassinated actor-turned-collaborator Igo Sym. It was a big affair. Imagine an European movie superstar who became a turncoat and was killed by an assassination squad in his own apartment despite him being under high security protection.  Completely apart from monetary taxations were in-kind taxes. These were unknown in pre-war Poland and were levied upon farmers who were obliged to deliver part of their produce. The tax rate differed between provinces on basis of many factors, both objective (like soil quality or type of produce) and arbitrary. Over time the rates were continuously increased and late in the war reached whooping 60% of produce in some regions. The execution of this tax was often savage. Avoidance was punished even by death or sending into a concentration or labor camp. Villages which were as a whole considered to be uncooperative were often burned and their inhabitants were wither killed or sent to labor or concentration camps. Produce taken from Polish farmers was used to feed German civilians in Germany and German armed forces. As a result of this policy, by the end of the war Poland was entering famine conditions.",
            " It depends on the time and the place.  In France, the French government retained sovereignty over the whole country. After the Battle of France had been decisively lost in 1940, the French Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud, tried and failed to convince the rest of the cabinet to evacuate the government to Algeria or Britain and continue fighting from there. Reynaud resigned rather than carry out the cabinet's desire to sue for peace, and the President (Albert Lebrun) appointed Marshall Philippe Petain (the leader of the surrender faction in the cabinet) to replace him. Petain asked Germany for an armistice, which Germany granted on terms that amounted to a surrender. Among other provisions, Northern and Western France (about 60% of Metropolitan France, including Paris) would be occupied by Germany until a final peace treaty was agreed (it never was, nor were negotiations ever begun in earnest), and France would be assessed an exorbitant fee to pay for the occupation. The rest of France (including the colonies) would remain unoccupied under the direct control of Petain's government.  Petain set up a new capital in Vichy, a small resort town in the unoccupied zone. There, the French Parliament voted itself out of existence and granted Petain dictatorial powers (ending the Third Republic and establishing what we now refer to as Vichy France). In the unoccupied zone, citizens paid their taxes as normal, except they were sent to Vichy instead of Paris. In the occupied zone, the German military and the French civilian administration had overlapping jurisdiction: the French bureaucrats still nominally worked for the government in Vichy, but they were required by the terms of the occupation to follow the policies of the occupation authorities. In the occupied zone, then, taxes were still assessed according to French law, by administrators who worked for the French government, but they operated under the direction and supervision of the German military. In practice, this supervision seemed to be relatively light: Petain's government's policies were aligned enough with German interests, and the German occupation's administrative resources were small enough, that the Germans mostly let Vichy set policy for the occupied zone. In both zones, the taxes went to Vichy, and in accordance with the armistice agreement, Vichy paid Germany the agreed-upon costs of the occupation (which were much higher than the actual costs, so Germany turned a substantial profit).  In November 1942, after Britain, America, and anti-Vichy French exile forces (\"Free France\") successfully invaded France's North African colonies (Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia), Germany executed Case Anton, occupying the remainder of Metropolitan France. The Vichy government remained in operation, however, and the French civilian administration continued running under German occupation.  Nazi-occupied Poland was divided up into two zones (plus a third zone in the East, which was annexed by the Soviet Union). Northern and Western Poland (a bit past the pre-WW1 borders of Imperial Germany) were annexed to the German Reich. They were integral parts of Germany, and were administered and taxed directly by the German government under German law and Nazi policy. The remainder of Poland was put under a special German occupation administration called the General Government, lead by a senior Nazi Party official (Hans Frank) who served as Governor-General of Poland. Frank and the other senior officials of the General Government ruled by decree, and they administered the territory mostly through imported German officials. The existing Polish civilian police were drafted into German service under German senior officers (mostly from the German civilian police) and used to help enforce the General Government's rule. The General Government collected taxes for its own internal use, and as with Vichy, they also sent a substantial portion of their revenue to Germany, officially as a reimbursement for the costs of the occupation.  **Sources:**  * Shirer, William, *The Collapse of the Third Republic*, 1969 * Mazower, Mark, *Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe*, 2008"

    "\n\nHuman: RBG\u2019s death has me thinking about Supreme Court history. Can anyone tell us about the Civil War Supreme Court? Specifically, were there Southerners on it? Did they remain loyal to the union or leave to join the Confederacy? I\u2019ve been reading a lot today about packing the court, and it keeps going back to the last time the numbers changed were just after the war while Grant was president.   That got me thinking about the Civil War court.   I know most (not all) politicians and military leaders chose state over nation and joined the side their state went with.   I\u2019m assuming some of the Supreme Court justices were Southerners. Do we know about their thoughts and their decisions? Were they viewed skeptically by their colleagues if they stayed? Did everyone manage to put aside the politics and war in order to work together from the bench? And did any Civil War based cases come before them? And if not, did they consciously avoid weighing in?  Thank you in advance.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " (1 / 4)  You've asked a lot of questions, and the answers could (and have) filled books. I'll try to address them all, though given the scope, I've left out some details.  > *Specifically, were there Southerners on it?*  ..  > *I\u2019m assuming some of the Supreme Court justices were Southerners.*  **THERE WERE EIGHT JUSTICES, INCLUDING FOUR FROM SLAVE STATES, AND ONE EMPTY SEAT**  At the time of Lincoln's election, there were eight living Supreme Court justices. One, Peter Vivian Daniel, a Democrat from Virginia, had died on May 31, 1860, during that year's Presidential campaign. President James Buchanan did not nominate a replacement before Election Day. His party was deeply divided as it was, with a Democratic National Convention less than a month before Daniel's death failing to nominate a presidential candidate. This resulted in a second convention already scheduled just a couple of weeks after Daniel died. And ultimately, that convention also failed, the Democrats could not unify, and they nominated two different presidential candidates at competing conventions.   Rather than risking a campaign issue that might aid the Democrats' opponents and further aggravate the Democrats' divide, Buchanan decided not to nominate anybody until after the election. Of course, immediately after the election, the Secession Crisis erupted, making it even more difficult for Buchanan to actually get anybody through, and the Supreme Court nomination took a back seat. Buchanan finally did make a nomination less than a month before leaving office. On February 5, 1861, he nominated Jeremiah Black but the nomination failed by a vote of 25-26 on February 21. (Black was Buchanan's Attorney General, though stepping in as Secretary of State in the administration's final weeks when SoS Lewis Cass resigned in December 1860 over Buchanan's handling of the Fort Sumter issue. Unlike Cass, Black was very much a \"Doughface\".)  **THERE WERE SEVEN DEMOCRATS AND ONE CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN ON THE BENCH**  Of the eight living justices, the court was decidedly conservative. All eight justices had been nominated by Democratic presidents. Only one non-Democrat was on the court - John McLean, the Whig-turned-conservative Republican, though even he had been nominated to the court by Andrew Jackson.   The other seven were all conservative Democrats, though their brands of conservatism followed the geographic North/South line. Nathan Clifford, Robert Cooper Grier, and Samuel Nelson were Northern Democrats whose pre-war rulings were very much in keeping with what might be expected of Northern Democrats. John Catron, James Moore Wayne, John Archibald Campbell, and Chief Justice Roger B. Taney were all Southern Democrats whose rulings reflected that partisanship - though Taney was actually from a slaveholding family from the non-seceding slave state of Maryland.  The other three - Catron, Wayne, and Campbell - were all from states that seceded (Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama, respectively). Of them, only Campbell actually resigned, and he waited over three months after Alabama seceded to actually hand in his resignation (after Fort Sumter).  > *Were they viewed skeptically by their colleagues if they stayed?*  **THE JUSTICES TRIED TO KEEP THE COURT INTACT**  No, in fact, there was an effort by the Northern Democrats to try to ensure that the three secession-state Democrats remained on the court. McLean, too, was somewhat involved in making sure the court stayed united, but it was really Samuel Nelson of New York who took the lead. Rather than antagonism, there was something of a camaraderie among them, that they didn't want to make the situation worse, and \"break up the court\". They were also all quite old, with six of them having been serving on the court between 15 and 30 years already. Though they had disagreements about law sometimes, socially, they all got along. (A few years earlier, Benjamin Curtis resigned after the *Dred Scott* decision, after having a falling out with Taney, but that's another story).   There were a couple of news reports in April 1861 that Campbell, Wayne, and Taney were going to resign en masse and issue a statement, first reported in the *Richmond Examiner* and *Philadedlphia Inquirer*, but these reports were pretty quickly discredited as inaccurate. Of the eight justices, the only one who really considered resigning is the one who did, and that was Campbell. Campbell would even write later on about telling Wayne of his decision, and while Wayne didn't try to stop him, he disagreed with him, and Campbell defended Wayne's own decision to stay on the court.  Outside their colleagues, there was some criticism by the press. When Campbell took his time in leaving Washington after resigning his seat, the *New York Post* called him a \"convenient spy for the Montgomery mutineers\". On the flipside, when Wayne remained on the court after the war started, the New York newspapers all praised his decision, while Atlanta's *Southern Confederacy* newspaper wrote: \"Georgia does not claim him, and he is no more of us\".  > *Did they remain loyal to the union or leave to join the Confederacy?*  ..  > *Do we know about their thoughts and their decisions?*  Yes, and I'm taking \"decisions\" here to mean their decision to stay on or leave the court. If you're asking about their history of Supreme Court case decisions, that's another matter, but to put it briefly, all except McLean were conservative Democrats, and McLean was a rather conservative Republican - in comparison to a moderate like Abraham Lincoln and a progressive like Sen. Benjamin Wade of Ohio. Though to the South, McLean was way too radical.   Again, there were three justices from seceding states on the court during the Secession Crisis - Catron of Tennessee, Wayne of Georgia, and Campbell of Alabama. And again, of the three, the only one who seriously considered resigning was the one who did, Campbell.  Nobody on the court issued a press release or anything giving a direct reason for deciding to stay or resign. But we can glean from their actions and writings what they believed.  **JOHN CATRON**  At the time of the Civil War, Supreme Court justices actually had two jobs. In February and August, they sat in session with the Supreme Court. At other parts of the year, each sat in session as one of the Circuit Court justices. Even now, each SCOTUS judge is assigned to overseeing one of the nine circuits, but in those days, the SCOTUS judge doubled as an actual Circuit Judge whenever their assigned circuit was in session.  On July 10, 1861, during John Catron's duties as a circuit court judge, he issued what is known as \"The Charge of Judge Catron to the Grand Jury at St. Louis\". These were jury instructions in which he essentially told a grand jury to treat acts committed by Confederates against the U.S. government as treason against the Constitution:  > \"...[T]he crime [of treason] is committed whenever war against the United States by those owing allegiance thereto, is raised, created, made or carried on; or when, daring a war, they adhere to the enemy, giving him aid and comfort. The terms 'levying war' embrace not merely the act of formal or declared war, but any combination, in military array, forcibly to prevent or oppose, generally, the execution of a provision either of the United States Constitution, or a United States statute: or forcibly to subvert the United States Government or any department thereof; or by force to procure the repeal or alteration of the Constitution or laws; if such combination be accompanied or followed by an act of forcible opposition in pursuance of the treasonable design.\"  If that's too obscure, the July 21, 1861, edition of the *Daily Nashville Patriot* printed Catron's Charge at length, and prefaced it with:  > \"We lay before our readers this morning that portion of the charge of Judge Catron to the Grand Jury at St. Louis on the 10th [of July 1861], which relates to the crime of treason. According to the definition of the learned Judge the volunteers of the State of Tennessee are traitors in arms against their Government, and liable to be punished as such. Judge Catron is a citizen of Tennessee, and the Confederate States, yet he clings to his position under the Federal Government, and gives it aid and comfort by holding its courts, and holding over the heads of our patriotic volunteers, struggling in the cause of liberty and independence, the penalties of treason.\"   Just three months after Fort Sumter, Catron was telling a jury in that hotbed of conflict, Missouri, to consider Confederates as traitors if they were to try to resist the enforcement of U.S. Constitutional law.",
            " Edit: I am not sure what question I read in my head about this but my thoughts went in lateral way and this is...relevant but doesn't answer your question super well. This is what I get for being helpful when I first wake up. Justice John Archibald Campbell is who we should be looking for answers about. The below is all informational and relevant    There has only ever been one impeached justice, Samuel Chase. Interestingly he is mentioned in the FAQ on the Supreme Court's website under \"Has a Justice ever been impeached?\"  > The only Justice to be impeached was Associate Justice Samuel Chase in 1805. The House of Representatives passed Articles of Impeachment against him; however, he was acquitted by the Senate.  I went to go refresh my memory on him when this popped up, so that's kinda cool!  Any way Samuel Chase was appointed by George Washington himself. To better understand why he was impeached, we have to first talk about the Judiciary Review Act of 1801, also known as the \"Midnight Judges Act\". The impact of this act was to empower the judicial branch but doubling the amount of circuits from 3, to 6, and adding 10 new judges. Prior to this act (and in fact up until 1879), Supreme Court justices would \"ride circuit\". This literally mean they were riding from circuit location to circuit location, performing judicial duties and learning of new cases, law, and the people.  So here you are, the body of the judiciary branch supposedly crafting the legal balance in the political force but you're riding up and down the eastern seaboard in a shitty carriage or on horseback, getting tossed into rivers, having bones broken, and just generally not staying near your family. Then the Judiciary Review Act comes along says, hey lets get you some backup. Sounds good right?  So here's where it goes south and draws parallels to today. The act was passed at the very end of the Adam's Administration, and Adams filled many of the open positions just days before Jefferson would take office. The whole \"Midnight Judges Act\" name was called such because Adams was \"signing the judges at midnight before his day was over\" as it were. This is very well displayed in this lovely Wikipedia List: List of federal judges appointed by John Adams. Adam's would step out of office March 4th 1801. Between Jan 1, and March 04 Adam's appointed:  * 1 Supreme court justice,  * 15 Circuit Judges * 1 District Judges  So it was a massive power swing towards the Federalist party after the loss to Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans. Jed Glickstein writes about it in After Midnight: The Circuit Judges and the Repeal of the Judiciary Act of 1801.   > To summarize: Thomas Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans defeated the reigning Federalist Party, led by President John Adams, in the election of 1800. In response, the lame-duck Federalists tried to shore up their position in the short time before Adams left office. Just a few weeks before Jefferson's inauguration, the outgoing Federalist Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1801, creating sixteen new federal circuit judgeships. In a separate act, Congress created three additional circuit judgeships and over forty justices of the peace for the District of Columbia. Adams hastily filled as many of these positions as he could with his supporters. As a Federalist senator famously observed to a friend, his party was \"about to experience a heavy gale of adverse wind; can they be blamed for casting many anchors to hold their ship thro the storm?\"  All seeming very familiar yeah?  But what does this have to do with Samuel chase, an already sitting justice? Jefferson comes to office and works to reverse the act with congress. It goes well and now you have Samuel chase, again a man who was literally thrown from his carriage into a river once while riding circuit asked to go do the very thing he despised. So like any angry man he went on a rant about it. And boy do judges have time to rant.    > Our stat and national Institutions were framed to secure ever member of society equal  liberty and equal rights, but the late alteration of the federal Judiciary and the recent change in our state constitution, by the establishing of universal suffragel and the further alteration that is contemplated in our State Judiciary (if adopted) will, in my judgement, take away all the security for our property and personal liberty. The independence of the National Judiciary is already shaken to its foundation; and the virtue of the people alone can restore it. The change of the State constitution, by allowing universal suffrage, will in my opionon, certainly and rapidly destroy all protection to property and all security to personal liberty; and our Republican Constitution will sink into a mobocracy, the worst of all possible governments. Will liberty or property be protected by laws made by representatives chose by electors who have no property in common interest with, or attached to the community?  Ok, so the dude went on a rant while arguing against people's right to vote, so...not really a winner in the history books looking back. But this rant was enough for Jefferson to do what Jefferson did, retort:  > Ought the seditious and official attack on the principles of our Constitution . . .to go unpunished?\"  This retort was a request made to the house of representatives, and thus followed the impeachment of Samuel Chase. This was orchestrated primarily by Congressman John Randolph   > Representative John Randolph of Virginia, at the urging of President Thomas Jefferson, orchestrated impeachment proceedings against Chase, declaring he would wipe the floor with the obnoxious justice. The House voted to impeach Chase on March 12, 1804, accusing Chase of  refusing to dismiss biased jurors and of excluding or limiting defense witnesses in two politically sensitive cases.  While he was Impeached, he was acquitted by the senate. There are a few good write ups (I like  Elkins and  McKitrick's The Age of Federalism) of what happened in this trial, but the summary from the official U.S. Senate history site is quite good   > Chase's defense team, which included several of the nation's most eminent attorneys, convinced several wavering senators that Chase's conduct did not warrant his removal from office. With at least six Jeffersonian Republicans joining the nine Federalists who voted not guilty on each article, the Senate on March 1, 1805, acquitted Samuel Chase on all counts. A majority voted guilty on three of the eight articles, but on each article the vote fell far short of the two-thirds required for conviction. The Senate thereby effectively insulated the judiciary from further congressional attacks based on disapproval of judges\u2019 opinions. Chase resumed his duties at the bench, where he remained until his death in 1811.   So that's the only impeached Supreme Court justice, but this was decades before our country was split in two  Enter West Hughes Humphreys   Humphreys was the presiding judge over all three of Tennessee's district courts. Upon secession and the creation of the Confederacy, Humphrey's  accepted an appointment to be a judge for the district. Makes sense, if you have a job, and that job gets taken over by a new owner, you can choose to just keep doing your same job for the new owner right?  Well...Kind of. Humphrey's still kept his old job, for his old bosses too. There wasn't really precedent for this at all.   Richard Aynes wrote about this in his paper \"The Impeachment and Removal of Tennessee Judge West Humphreys: John Bingham's Prologue to the Johnson Impeachment Trial\"   > At the beginning of the Civil War many individuals who held positions under the United States government submitted resignations which, in their minds, allowed them to assume positions with the so-called government of the Confederate States of America. One of the few individuals who did not do so, but nevertheless assumed a position under the Confederate States of America was U.S. District Judge West H. Humphreys. After the Confederacy was formed, he continued to hold court in the same courtroom but under the guise of a Confederate States Judge. > > This presented two problems for President Lincoln and the Unionists. First, without even the thin reed of resignation to attempt to protect him, this made Humphreys a visible and active traitor. Second, though one could argue that Humphreys had functionally vacated the U.S. District Court judgeship, others could make arguments that as long as Humphreys had not resigned there was no vacancy for President Lincoln to fill.    So pretty clear where this is going right? He's impeached and in 1862 the Senate finds him guilty, bans him from serving in a federal appointment forever, and vacates the seat. You can read the Senate minutes  here.   There were 7 articles brought against him and (most) of them were a landslide Most importantly   > Article 1. That, regardless of his duties as a citizen of the United  States, and unmindful of the duties of his said office, and in  violation of the sacred obligation of his official oath ``to administer  justice without respect to persons,'' ``and faithfully and impartially  discharge all the duties incumbent upon him as judge of the district  court of the United States for the several districts of the State of  Tennessee agreeable to the Constitution and laws of the United  States,''  39 guilty 0 not guilty.      SO I hope that answers your question, in the sense that No, no supreme court justices were impeached because of the Civil War"

The House of Representatives passed Articles of Impeachment against him; however, he was acquitted by the Senate.  I went to go refresh my memory on him when this popped up, so that's kinda cool!  Any way Samuel Chase was appointed by George Washington himself. To better understand why he was impeached, we have to first talk about the Judiciary Review Act of 1801, also known as the \"Midnight Judges Act\". The impact of this act was to empower the judicial branch but doubling the amount of circuits from 3, to 6, and adding 10 new judges. Prior to this act (and in fact up until 1879), Supreme Court justices would \"ride circuit\". This literally mean they were riding from circuit location to circuit location, performing judicial duties and learning of new cases, law, and the people.  So here you are, the body of the judiciary branch supposedly crafting the legal balance in the political force but you're riding up and down the eastern seaboard in a shitty carriage or on horseback, getting tossed into rivers, having bones broken, and just generally not staying near your family. Then the Judiciary Review Act comes along says, hey lets get you some backup. Sounds good right?  So here's where it goes south and draws parallels to today. The act was passed at the very end of the Adam's Administration, and Adams filled many of the open positions just days before Jefferson would take office. The whole \"Midnight Judges Act\" name was called such because Adams was \"signing the judges at midnight before his day was over\" as it were. This is very well displayed in this lovely Wikipedia List: List of federal judges appointed by John Adams. Adam's would step out of office March 4th 1801. Between Jan 1, and March 04 Adam's appointed:  * 1 Supreme court justice,  * 15 Circuit Judges * 1 District Judges  So it was a massive power swing towards the Federalist party after the loss to Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans. Jed Glickstein writes about it in After Midnight: The Circuit Judges and the Repeal of the Judiciary Act of 1801.   > To summarize: Thomas Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans defeated the reigning Federalist Party, led by President John Adams, in the election of 1800. In response, the lame-duck Federalists tried to shore up their position in the short time before Adams left office. Just a few weeks before Jefferson's inauguration, the outgoing Federalist Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1801, creating sixteen new federal circuit judgeships. In a separate act, Congress created three additional circuit judgeships and over forty justices of the peace for the District of Columbia. Adams hastily filled as many of these positions as he could with his supporters. As a Federalist senator famously observed to a friend, his party was \"about to experience a heavy gale of adverse wind; can they be blamed for casting many anchors to hold their ship thro the storm?\"  All seeming very familiar yeah?  But what does this have to do with Samuel chase, an already sitting justice? Jefferson comes to office and works to reverse the act with congress. It goes well and now you have Samuel chase, again a man who was literally thrown from his carriage into a river once while riding circuit asked to go do the very thing he despised. So like any angry man he went on a rant about it. And boy do judges have time to rant.    > Our stat and national Institutions were framed to secure ever member of society equal  liberty and equal rights, but the late alteration of the federal Judiciary and the recent change in our state constitution, by the establishing of universal suffragel and the further alteration that is contemplated in our State Judiciary (if adopted) will, in my judgement, take away all the security for our property and personal liberty. The independence of the National Judiciary is already shaken to its foundation; and the virtue of the people alone can restore it. The change of the State constitution, by allowing universal suffrage, will in my opionon, certainly and rapidly destroy all protection to property and all security to personal liberty; and our Republican Constitution will sink into a mobocracy, the worst of all possible governments. Will liberty or property be protected by laws made by representatives chose by electors who have no property in common interest with, or attached to the community?  Ok, so the dude went on a rant while arguing against people's right to vote, so...not really a winner in the history books looking back. But this rant was enough for Jefferson to do what Jefferson did, retort:  > Ought the seditious and official attack on the principles of our Constitution . . .to go unpunished?\"  This retort was a request made to the house of representatives, and thus followed the impeachment of Samuel Chase. This was orchestrated primarily by Congressman John Randolph   > Representative John Randolph of Virginia, at the urging of President Thomas Jefferson, orchestrated impeachment proceedings against Chase, declaring he would wipe the floor with the obnoxious justice. The House voted to impeach Chase on March 12, 1804, accusing Chase of  refusing to dismiss biased jurors and of excluding or limiting defense witnesses in two politically sensitive cases.  While he was Impeached, he was acquitted by the senate. There are a few good write ups (I like  Elkins and  McKitrick's The Age of Federalism) of what happened in this trial, but the summary from the official U.S. Senate history site is quite good   > Chase's defense team, which included several of the nation's most eminent attorneys, convinced several wavering senators that Chase's conduct did not warrant his removal from office. With at least six Jeffersonian Republicans joining the nine Federalists who voted not guilty on each article, the Senate on March 1, 1805, acquitted Samuel Chase on all counts. A majority voted guilty on three of the eight articles, but on each article the vote fell far short of the two-thirds required for conviction. The Senate thereby effectively insulated the judiciary from further congressional attacks based on disapproval of judges\u2019 opinions. Chase resumed his duties at the bench, where he remained until his death in 1811.   So that's the only impeached Supreme Court justice, but this was decades before our country was split in two  Enter West Hughes Humphreys   Humphreys was the presiding judge over all three of Tennessee's district courts. Upon secession and the creation of the Confederacy, Humphrey's  accepted an appointment to be a judge for the district. Makes sense, if you have a job, and that job gets taken over by a new owner, you can choose to just keep doing your same job for the new owner right?  Well...Kind of. Humphrey's still kept his old job, for his old bosses too. There wasn't really precedent for this at all.   Richard Aynes wrote about this in his paper \"The Impeachment and Removal of Tennessee Judge West Humphreys: John Bingham's Prologue to the Johnson Impeachment Trial\"   > At the beginning of the Civil War many individuals who held positions under the United States government submitted resignations which, in their minds, allowed them to assume positions with the so-called government of the Confederate States of America. One of the few individuals who did not do so, but nevertheless assumed a position under the Confederate States of America was U.S. District Judge West H. Humphreys. After the Confederacy was formed, he continued to hold court in the same courtroom but under the guise of a Confederate States Judge. > > This presented two problems for President Lincoln and the Unionists. First, without even the thin reed of resignation to attempt to protect him, this made Humphreys a visible and active traitor. Second, though one could argue that Humphreys had functionally vacated the U.S. District Court judgeship, others could make arguments that as long as Humphreys had not resigned there was no vacancy for President Lincoln to fill.    So pretty clear where this is going right? He's impeached and in 1862 the Senate finds him guilty, bans him from serving in a federal appointment forever, and vacates the seat. You can read the Senate minutes  here.   There were 7 articles brought against him and (most) of them were a landslide Most importantly   > Article 1. That, regardless of his duties as a citizen of the United  States, and unmindful of the duties of his said office, and in  violation of the sacred obligation of his official oath ``to administer  justice without respect to persons,'' ``and faithfully and impartially  discharge all the duties incumbent upon him as judge of the district  court of the United States for the several districts of the State of  Tennessee agreeable to the Constitution and laws of the United  States,''  39 guilty 0 not guilty.      SO I hope that answers your question, in the sense that No, no supreme court justices were impeached because of the Civil War"

            " There are two ways to attack the subject at the heart of your excellent question: by using early medieval primary sources (which are always too rare) and by considering early modern folklore collected in the North Sea area and projecting backwards (which has its own problems). At the heart of the problem with projecting backwards using early modern sources is that folklore is not monolithic, by its nature. Folk traditions, beliefs, and the narratives that express those beliefs are subject to change because there is no single dogmatic doctrine that provides an anchor from which the tradition cannot drift. Similarly, it is too easy - and error ridden - to generalize about traditions using rare early-medieval sources. The two types of evidence provide glimpses at a tradition in motion, and yet, they do point to some observations.  There is a reasonably homogeneous tradition of supernatural beings, which people believed lived in family groups and/or communities and which is documented in historic and pre-modern professional collections, ranging from wherever Scandinavian languages are spoken, Britain, Ireland, nearby islands, and Brittany.  Because this generic tradition (acknowledging enormous variation over time and geography and also a wide variety of terms for the entities) is so widespread and appears in some of the oldest documents from the area, so that it is reasonable to conclude that the roots of the tradition is pre-conversion.   At the same time, it seems inevitable that conversion affected the tradition and shaped it over time. That said, the Church appears to have failed at the one thing it strived to achieve - namely, to group these supernatural beings together with the forces of evil. We see evidence of this effort in the passage in the Anglo-Saxon poem, Beowulf, when the poet writes that elves, like the monster Grendel, were descendants of Cain:  >From him the evil brood were all born,  >Giants and elves and evil spirits,  >And also the giants who fought against God  >For a long time; He paid them retribution for that.  That clerical point of view did not generally affect the folk tradition, which maintained that the elves (fairies, sidhe, pixies, hidden folk, or other names) were neither good nor evil. Mind you, people feared them, for they were extraordinarily dangerous and were capable of inflicting terrible harm, not the least of which was abduction, which could last for eternity and deprive the poor soul of salvation. The elves had to be treated with caution, respect, and deference, and most of all, they needed to be avoided. But they were not in league with Satan - that was a different kettle of supernatural beings.  In pre-modern collections from North Sea cultures, we find numerous explanations of the origin of the elves (with all their names), some of which are placed in a Biblical context: the elves were angels who refused to take a side in the battle between God and Satan, so they were cast out of heaven to live on earth (but not Hell) apart from the Christian struggle between good and evil; or the elves were the children of Eve who, when she realized God was coming for a visit, was only able to clean some of her children, and so she hid the others, and God answered that those who were hidden from Him would be hidden from mankind for all time. At the same time, there is a widespread legend that tells of the possible salvation of the elves: a young man is traveling through the forest and sees the elves celebrating, so he calls out and says that they have no reason to celebrate since they cannot know salvation, at which point the elves begin to cry. He goes home and tells his father what happened, and his father tells him to return with word that they will know salvation, which the boy does, and the elves resume their party. Some times the boy tells them that they have no more chance at salvation than does his walking stick have a chance to sprout leaves. The next morning the walking stick is full of leaves, and so the boy goes back and tells the elves the news.  The repeated message in these stories is that the elves are not evil, and that if they lean in one direction or the other, it is on the side of salvation. The Church, however, persisted in its attempt to say that all supernatural beings not specifically identified as being on God's side in the bible are by necessity on the side of evil - maintaining a strict division of the universe into those two halves. During the witch trials, for example, people could be accused of cavorting with the elves, with the consequence being the same as cavorting the demons. Despite that dark chapter in folk belief, the folk persisted in seeing the elves as theologically neutral, and while they were to be feared, there were also stories of these supernatural beings rewarding people of good character and generosity.  That leaves us with the odd tradition of incorporating the word \"Aelf\" into Anglo-Saxon names - Alfred, being one of the more common that descends to this time. There can be no question that people understood the meaning of these names, but that does not mean that they took them to mean that in a literal way. We have names including Rose and Marigold, but that doesn't mean that we automatically think of those flowers when we encounter those people. I knew a fellow named, of all things, Rex King (parents with a sense of humor or a lack of imagination!), and all his schoolmates no doubt understood that Rex meant king, but we didn't think along those terms when we encountered him - or at least I didn't.   It has always struck me as odd that the Anglo-Saxon people might be summoning dangerous supernatural beings with a name that uses their name, but we have to set that aside as something that apparently cannot be resolved, and we must merely accept the fact that the Anglo-Saxon naming tradition included this word, and people did not think of it as taunting the dangerous supernatural beings.  edit: Thanks for the anonymous gilding of the answer - and for the platinum!

    "\n\nHuman: Monday Methods: Politics, Presentism, and Responding to the President of the AHA AskHistorians has long recognized the political nature of our project. History is never written in isolation, and public history in particular must be aware of and engaged with current political concerns. This ethos has applied both to the operation of our forum and to our engagement with significant events.  Years of moderating the subreddit have demonstrated that calls for a historical methodology free of contemporary concerns achieve little more than silencing already marginalized narratives. Likewise, many of us on the mod team and panel of flairs do not have the privilege of separating our own personal work from weighty political issues.  Last week, Dr. James Sweet, president of the American Historical Association, published a column for the AHA\u2019s newsmagazine *Perspectives on History* titled \u201cIs History History? Identity Politics and Teleologies of the Present\u201d. Sweet uses the column to address historians whom he believes have given into \u201cthe allure of political relevance\u201d and now \u201cforeshorten or shape history to justify rather than inform contemporary political positions.\u201d The article quickly caught the attention of academics on social media, who have criticized it for dismissing the work of Black authors, for being ignorant of the current political situation, and for employing an uncritical notion of \"presentism\" itself. Sweet\u2019s response two days later, now appended above the column, apologized for his \u201cham-fisted attempt at provocation\u201d but drew further ire for only addressing the harm he didn\u2019t intend to cause and not the ideas that caused that harm.  In response to this ongoing controversy, today\u2019s Monday Methods is a space to provide some much-needed context for the complex historical questions Sweet provokes and discuss the implications of such a statement from the head of one of the field\u2019s most significant organizations. We encourage questions, commentary, and discussion, keeping in mind that our rules on civility and informed responses still apply.  To start things off, we\u2019ve invited some flaired users to share their thoughts and have compiled some answers that address the topics specifically raised in the column:  **The 1619 Project**  * /u/EdHistory101 and /u/MikeDash discuss the project in this thread, with links to more discussion within  * /u/Red_Galiray on Southern colonies\u2019 fears of Britain ending slavery   **African Involvement in the Slave Trade**  * /u/LXT130J answers \u201cTo what extent were the Dahomey a tribe of slavers?\u201d  * /u/commustar covers the treatment of slavery by African academics  * /u/swarthmoreburke in this thread and /u/halfacupoftea in this nuance what is meant by slavery in West Africa  * /u/q203 and /u/swarthmoreburke on African response to Back-to-Africa movements  **Gun Laws in the United States**  * /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov on the interpretation of the 2nd Amendment  * /u/uncovered-history discusses the phrase \u201cwell-regulated\u201d  * /u/PartyMoses on the idea of a \u201cmilitia\u201d with additional follow-ups here  **Objectivity and the Historical Method**  * /u/Snapshot52 answers Is Research Value Neutral?  * /u/commiespaceinvader on Empathy as the Central Skill of Historians  * /u/crrpit and /u/erissays discuss objectivity in \u201crecent\u201d history  * /u/MikeDash on unbiased sources  * /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov additionally on unbiased sources as well as on the impact of terminology on historical perspectives\n\nAssistant:": {

One of the crucial things about the foreign volunteering phenomenon in Spain is that it happened in waves. Many of the earliest foreigners who fought were either already in Spain when the conflict broke out, or made their way there using their own means or informal networks, and this remained the norm in the first few months of the conflict. This meant that the initial wave of volunteers could be quite heterogeneous, covering not just idealists (for a quite varied set of ideals at this point) but also mercenaries and adventurers who saw the conflict itself as the opportunity rather than the political stakes. Those who made it to Spain integrated themselves into the haphazard structures of the Republican forces as best they could, generally by attaching themselves to whatever militia column best reflected their beliefs and/or would take them. It's important to remember just how chaotic the Republican state and armed forces were in these crucial early weeks - there was no formal centralised process, and getting to fight was more about convincing local militia, political party or trade union leaders that they should trust you and let you join them.  However, in autumn 1936, volunteering started to change drastically. This was partly due to the Republican Government gradually re-establishing itself as a cohesive state, but mostly because the Soviet Union made a decision to actively intervene to support the Republic. Part of this intervention involved selling arms and supplies, providing a safe(ish) home for Spanish gold reserves to finance further overseas purchases and sending military advisors and specialists. For our purposes though, the key decision was that instead of trying to send an entire army to Spain to fight - which Stalin had little desire and most importantly limited capacity to do - they would try and facilitate the recruitment of international volunteers with military experience to bolster the inexperienced and poorly (barely) trained Spanish militias.   This decision was significant because the USSR had spent much of its existence building an international network of communist organisations. This was the Communist International (usually referred to as Comintern), which was based in Moscow and sought to guide and coordinate communist groups around the world. It was the exact kind of network that could sustain a widespread recruitment effort, with experience in operating relatively clandestinely and in many cases illegally, and fostering connections across borders between individuals and affiliated organisations. Culturally, interwar communism was also a natural home for those who might *want* to volunteer - these were organisations that actively sought to emulate and follow the Bolshevik revolutionary model, seeking to foster an elite, disciplined and politically united vanguard of the proletariat. Communists' belligerent attitude towards fascism - advocating confrontation and containment both internationally and on the streets - also meant that communist parties were generally home to those who were keenest to take direct, decisive action against fascism.  The Comintern was put in charge of organising this international army, using its national affiliates to recruit volunteers, its transnational connections to get them Spain and its elite operatives as the military and political leadership. Even when France closed its borders with Spain, the Comintern (and the Communist Party of France) were able to set up an effective system to smuggle volunteers south from Paris and across the Pyrenees. Unlike the first wave of volunteers, this new wave would join dedicated international formations that became known as the International Brigades. They never had a complete monopoly over foreigners fighting for the Republic, but the bulk of foreign volunteers (about 90%) ended up in their ranks. This was due in part to their absorbing many of the ad hoc international formations, but also because the Comintern recruitment networks were much better organised, and the number of volunteers rapidly increased over the winter of 1936-7, with smaller but significant flows being sustained through to spring 1938.  Comintern's involvement meant that the volunteers themselves became more homogenous, both politically and socially. George Orwell is actually a good example of how that might happen - he had applied to join the International Brigades in London, but failed to convince the Communist Party of Great Britain that he was politically reliable enough - they weren't massive fans of his recent writing (this was pre-Animal Fram and 1984, the issue was more that they saw Orwell as middle-class dilettante), and figured he just wanted to go to Spain so he could write about it rather than being fully dedicated to the cause. Orwell instead managing to leverage connections with the British Independent Labour Party, which in turn had connections with a small Spanish revolutionary party (the POUM), and Orwell was able to join a small group of non-communist international volunteers serving in their militia (Hemingway, for the record, did not actually fight in Spain, but went there as a journalist).   The result was that the International Brigades were dominated by the Comintern, with national units generally run by their respective national communist parties (the American Abraham Lincoln Battalion, for instance, was dominated by Communist Party of the USA leaders). Not every volunteer from this point onwards *was* a formal member of a communist party - depending on the national grouping, the figure was usually somewhere between 40-60% - but even those who weren't formal members were those considered politically reliable by the Party (unlike Orwell) and had broadly accepted that the communist policy of confronting fascism was the correct one. While these units were not always politically harmonious in practice, not least because they went through some brutal, disillusioning experiences, they were a far cry from the very varied array of volunteers that first went to Spain. This was a Stalinist army in terms of culture, politics and organisation.  One important caveat to end on here is that it might be tempting to read 'Stalinist' in particular ways here (particularly given the connection with Orwell, who left the conflict as a dedicated anti-Stalinist). It's important to acknowledge though that the Spanish Civil War happened at a key moment of transition for Stalinism - the Great Purge kicked off *during* the war, and in any case, foreign adherents to communism were generally attracted to an imagined, idealised version of Stalinism and the Soviet Union, who took the pretensions of Soviet democracy under Stalin as real. While there were undoubtedly politically dark sides to the International Brigades - the obsession with Trotskyists and other potential enemies within is very obvious in the source material - for the most part, the foreign communist volunteers were trying to run the International Brigades as they imagined their idealised Bolsheviks might, rather than trying to emulate the reality of Stalin's rule.  (while I've touched indirectly on some of the reasons why Spain saw such an unprecedentedly large number of volunteers, if you're after a more specific treatment of the question, I answered it in quite a bit of depth here)."

    "\n\nHuman: In the movie \"Nuremberg\", Hermann Goering expects to be treated like a honored guest by the Allies; he is visibly shocked after being put in handcuffs and declared a war criminal. Did the Nazis really expect leniency from the Allies? According to the movie, Goering is smiling arrogantly as he walks with a white flag towards the Americans; he wonders when he will be meeting General Eisenhower to shake hands and drink wine together. Goering is visibly shaken when instead, the Allied soldiers throw handcuffs on him and say that he is under arrest, pending investigation, as a war criminal.  Is this an accurate portrayal of what Nazi leaders expected would happen when they surrendered, as opposed to what actually happened? It sounds incredibly delusional to me. How did they think they would be received after a devastating global war, evidence of the Holocaust, etc?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " \"The age of cannons and sails and pirates\" is pretty broad, but I think we can fairly say that between a period of say 1650 or so and 1805 or so, naval battles were often quite lethal to the people involved. The caveat here of course is that the tactics used and the motivation of the people involved ebbed and flowed over time, and so there's not really a straight line we can draw among different encounters.   Just to set our parameters: I'm picking 1650ish to bound this on the early end because the first Anglo-Dutch war started in 1652, and the three conflicts (1652-54, 1665-67 and 1672-74) saw the development and codification of what we generally refer to as line-of-battle tactics for fleet engagements.   I'm picking 1805 as the bound on the other end because, of course, the battle of Trafalgar saw a complete abandonment of those tactics and a decisive victory for Britain.   The Anglo-Dutch wars saw the first widespread use of the line-of-battle tactic that would dominate naval tactics for the next 150 years or so. The exact origin of the idea that you would line up ships front to rear and engage the enemy's line arranged in the same way is pretty well disputed -- some people trace this back to 1500, others say that Maarten Tromp used the tactic in 1639 -- but for our purposes that's kind of a moot point, because the line-of-battle tactics used in the Anglo-Dutch wars often produced long-running engagements, many of which resulted in simple mutual exhaustion on both sides. If both sides kept to a strict line, engagements usually ran a fairly regular course of the ships passing one another and firing away until one fleet edged away, enough ships were damaged that the rest tried to flee, or darkness fell and one side broke off the battle.   If that didn't happen, though, and a line became disordered due to damage, lack of leadership, flaws in weather, etc., the battle could turn quite quickly in favor of one side or the other. The Four Days' Battle is probably a good and also bad example of this -- it's quite unusual in being the largest battle of the Age of Sail, though it's not well known, and resulted in a decisive English defeat in the second Anglo-Dutch war.   It was fought from 11-14 June 1666 (New Style) with 54 ships on the English side against 84 on the Dutch side. The English, commanded by George Monck (the duke of Albemarle) decided to attack the numerically superior Dutch fleet commanded by Michiel de Ruyter in hopes of defeating them in detail before the Dutch could combine. In the event, on the first day Albermarle did not double up or fall on a portion of the Dutch fleet but fought a conventional battle at range, to his disadvantage.   On the second day, the ships again formed lines but seem to have quite often cut through one line or the other to attempt to engage with some numerical superiority; the English fleet suffered heavily in this encounter. Admiral de Ruyter's ship was badly damaged and he withdrew from the fighting, but at the end of the day the English fleet was reduced to only 29 ships that were battle-worthy. Albermarle decided to withdraw to the west, and on the third day the Dutch fleet gave chase but stayed out of range, fearing the large English stern-chasers. Albermale's course took the fleet over the Galloper shoal, and several ships grounded, including Admiral George Ayscue's *Prince Royal*; his men, panicking, forced him to surrender the ship. He was, and remains, the highest-ranking English naval officer to have been captured by an enemy.   On the fourth day, the English fleet received some reinforcements, including fireships, and decided to attack the Dutch fleet. Both sides realized that this might be the decisive battle of the war. The English attacked from leeward, in an unfortunate position for a sea-fight, and the Dutch fleet was able to encircle and overwhelm them. Sir Christopher Myngs, taking over as admiral of the van from Ayscue, was shot with a musket-ball and fatally wounded; with the van falling into disarray, de Ruyter attacked Albermale's squadron directly and forced him to retreat into a fog bank.   Both fleets took fairly heavy damage, but the English had the worse, with about 1,500 men killed, 1,500 or so wounded, and 1,800 captured (many of whom served in the Dutch fleet later). The Dutch lost about 1,500 killed and 1,300 wounded, but had the tactical and strategic victory.   What happened between the Anglo-Dutch wars and the Napoleonic period is a time where there was a bit of tactical indecisiveness, not to say outright cowardice, on the part of the British. The battle of Minorca is a good example -- evenly matched British and French fleets fought an indecisive battle, with 38 killed and 150 or so wounded on the British side and 45/160 on the French, after which the British held a council of war and decided to withdraw. This led to John Byng being convicted of cowardice and shot; after which British captains and admirals had a much stronger motivation to seek decisive battle.   I wrote about the battle of Quiberon Bay here before, which I'll c-p below:   > This is exactly what British admiral Sir Edward Hawke did in 1759: the bulk of his fleet lay off the northwest of Ushant, with two small ships of the line under Augustus Hervey anchored off the Black Rocks at the Iroise watching the Goulet. His ships were often blown off station, but a westerly wind usually meant that the French were bottled up in port even as the British ships were blown off blockade.  >The reason for keeping the French fleet in port was that the French, growing desperate at their losses in the Americas, had decided in 1758 upon an invasion of Britain. The invasion fleet was assembling in Vannes, in the west of France, while the battle fleet was at Brest (at the time, there were only sketchy land communications with Brest -- it relied on coastal shipping for nearly everything, and an army couldn't assemble there). The fleet would have to break out of Brest, sail to Vannes to pick up the transports, and then evade the British fleet to land troops somewhere in Britain, which was a tall order.  >The French were increasingly desperate to break out of port as 1759 drew to a close, and when a westerly gale blew Hawke off station in November, the French acted. The same day that the storm died down and Hawke left Torbay, the French left Brest. They were blown far to the west before they could come about and head for Vannes, and had trouble with the fleet because many of its men were inexperienced at sea after being bottled up in port. They sailed for Quiberon Bay, where the transports waited, with the British fleet on their heels, and made it almost there before sighting the British fleet. The French gambled that the British would not follow them into Quiberon Bay, because the British lacked charts of the area, but Hawke attacked at once and the French fleet fled. The British caught up with the tail end of the French fleet just as the van was entering the bay, and at that point the wind backed and headed the French, as well as kicking up an extremely rough sea.  >The battle was a disaster for the French; the Thesee sank attempting to open its lower gunports (the ship flooded) and the Superbe sank after two broadsides from Hawke's flagship. One French ship was captured; three were trapped in the Vilaine river with their guns thrown overboard to lighten ship; and six were wrecked or sunk. Two British ships were also driven ashore and wrecked, but their crews were rescued.  British casualties were about 400 men killed, against French of 2,500 lost in battle and/or drowned.   The best-known battles of the age of sail, of course, were Nelson's three victories at the Nile, Copenhagen, and Trafalgar. I've written about the Nile here and Trafalgar here -- casualties in both battles were quite high.   Of course, that doesn't also mean there were engagements with fewer! The famous action between *HMS Speedy* and the Spanish ship *Gamo* ended with the British losing three killed and nine wounded, in capturing a much larger ship with 14 killed and 41 wounded (more men than were on board *Speedy*).   I'm going to need to stop here for now, but I will come back later and expand!",
            " Not so much about pirates but one of the innovations of Admiral Nelson was the introduction of deliberate chaos into naval warfare with an aim at being spectacularly lethal. The battle of Trafalgar, and similar actions, saw the British outkill their enemies by a ratio of 10 to 1 or more. I can't speak as much to pirates except by a bit of extrapolation but clashes between naval armed forces could be highly lethal.  This \"innovation\" came about for a variety of reasons, some practical and some cultural, but prior to Nelson and commanders like him the accepted method had been for two fleets to approach each other in an orderly fashion, maneuver to get a wind advantage, and then, at the direction of the admiral, engage with an aim toward capturing enemy ships. Crews, captains, and admirals all got a share of the value of captured ships so destroying the enemy wasn't exactly the highest priority if you could avoid doing so. Furthermore, \"not losing\" was more important than \"winning\", per se.  All this began to change in the early to mid 1700s but the tipping point is really probably in 1757 when the British shoot an admiral for cowardice. Admiral Byng came from a long line of British seamen and was the equivalent of the royalty of the British Navy. However, he made a fatal miscalculation off Minorca by not closing with a French fleet that outnumbered and outgunned him, despite the fact that he had the wind advantage. There'd been a fierce debate about changing sea tactics for a while but the Admiralty ended up court-martialing him, convicting him, and then denying some very high-level pleas for mercy before having him executed by firing squad. If you could shoot an admiral with close connections to royalty, a family history of naval service, and a lifetime of service of his own then NO ONE was getting a pass. Nelson was born a year later and came up through the ranks of a Royal Navy with a very different ethos.  Nelson really came into his own at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent, where he took his 74 gun ship, disobeyed direct orders, and attacked three Spanish ships with a total of 322 guns. Ultimately he fought until all four ships were badly damaged, then stormed one of the Spanish ships with a boarding party. This was \\*not how things were done\\* and it threw the Spanish for a complete loop. The battle was a huge British victory but the Royal Navy didn't want to reward Nelson for disobeying orders so he didn't get shot but he didn't get promoted either. Privately, his superiors realized he had a visionary approach to cataclysmic killing.  Nelson would refine this over the course of his career and as he became more and more of a hero to the British public he began to draw people to his way of thinking. His crews were close-knit and fiercely personally loyal (partially due to the fact that the British navy was a pretty strict meritocracy in which everyone started at the bottom, albeit sometimes with advantages, and worked their way up). He encouraged constant training on firing so that his crews could fire much more quickly than their counterparts, even if it meant dry firing due to the Admiralty not giving them powder allocations for training, and often bought supplemental powder to train his gun crews. His captains, as he rose through the ranks, were disciples of this approach. This was coupled with the rise of the Romantic movement in Europe, particularly in Britain, which saw a societal fascination with purifying nature cataclysmic violence and a hearkening back to Britain's Romantic past.  At Trafalgar, Nelson's famous signal was \"England expects that every man will do his duty\"; it is worth noting that he first ordered \"confides\" instead of \"expects\" but that would have had to have been spelled out and there was a single flag for \"expects\", which saved considerable time as battle approached. This encapsulates his philosophy almost perfectly.  He chose England, the realm of Richard the Lionheart and King Arthur, over \"Britain\", \"every man\" from the captains to the powder monkeys, and \"confides\" instead of \"demands\" or \"orders\". The effect is something akin to \"your countrymen back home, your families and towns, your King and Parliament, are confident that each and every one of you will carry the fate of the nation in your hands today\". Instead of approaching in an orderly line alongside the Spanish and French fleets, he hit them perpendicularly in the center of their line and the rest, effectively, is history.  To return to the extrapolation a bit, pirates would have lacked a lot of these motivations- they weren't in a national service and they were fighting primarily for plunder so they'd like their opponents to surrender with as little damage to the valuable ships as possible. They likely didn't have the same standards of discipline and didn't train as often (although this isn't a universal by any means).  You might check out \"Seize the Fire: Heroism, Duty, and the Battle of Trafalgar\" by Adam Nicolson for a quick, easy, but thorough overview of how, why, and when all these things changed.",

            " \"The age of cannons and sails and pirates\" is pretty broad, but I think we can fairly say that between a period of say 1650 or so and 1805 or so, naval battles were often quite lethal to the people involved.

On the fourth day, the English fleet received some reinforcements, including fireships, and decided to attack the Dutch fleet. Both sides realized that this might be the decisive battle of the war. The English attacked from leeward, in an unfortunate position for a sea-fight, and the Dutch fleet was able to encircle and overwhelm them.

The same day that the storm died down and Hawke left Torbay, the French left Brest.

They sailed for Quiberon Bay, where the transports waited, with the British fleet on their heels, and made it almost there before sighting the British fleet. The French gambled that the British would not follow them into Quiberon Bay, because the British lacked charts of the area, but Hawke attacked at once and the French fleet fled.

One French ship was captured; three were trapped in the Vilaine river with their guns thrown overboard to lighten ship; and six were wrecked or sunk. Two British ships were also driven ashore and wrecked, but their crews were rescued.  British casualties were about 400 men killed, against French of 2,500 lost in battle and/or drowned.   The best-known battles of the age of sail, of course, were Nelson's three victories at the Nile, Copenhagen, and Trafalgar.

            " I\u2019m not a historian of the era, but a fan. Also British, so sorry for the bias in my knowledge.  The era you are talking about really fits between the late 16th century, and the early to mid 19th century. Prior to this era, the battles concerned themselves with trying to board the other vessels, hence the Spanish Galleons that typified the time had very high fore- and aft-castles, to gain the high ground, so to speak. This era ended with the introduction of steel armoured ships (The French Gloire being the first in 1859), and gun turrets (USS Monitor - 1862) rather than broadsides.  In the late 15th century, Britain developed a compact gun carriage, It invention is sometimes attributed to Henry VIII. This is the type of gun carriage you see in historic vessels, and on shows like Hornblower. Prior to this Field guns, with large wheel carriages were install on ships. The smaller carriages meant that the guns could recoil further, allowing for larger calibres and much faster reload speeds.  The efficacy of this invention was demonstrated during the Spanish Armada, with the Spanish still using the old field gun carriages, and the English using the new compact carriages. One pitch battles, where the English lost no ships to combat (8 fire ships to burn the Spanish out of port to actually fight them).  The Spanish lost over 600 dead in the battle of Gravelines plus 800 wounded (out of 7000 sailors and 17000 soldiers). 5 ships were sunk, but most of the Spanish fleet was severely damaged. If they had been modern warships with that much damage they\u2019d have sunk, but fundamentally wood floats. Overall the Spanish lost c.20,000 of 24,000 on that campaign, mostly lost to the high seas taking the long way back over the top of Scotland and Ireland. The English lost only a maximum of 100 to combat (6-8000 to disease chasing the Spanish over the top.) From the dead in the battle at least it shows that the new carriage was 6x more lethal.  This was a bit of a theme from pitch battles at the time, the tail of the butchers bill was usually higher then the bill during combat, as badly damaged ships succumbed to high seas, or crew fell ill in foetid conditions.  Thus during this era, naval battle was global, and a lot of the skills centered around navigation and being able to bring your guns to bear. Hear generally the English, then British, excelled as the song would have it \u201cBritannia rules the waves\u201d. They employed frigates as the were faster, and more manouverable, and more that a match for a merchant ship. Generally if they were unlucky enough to be cornered by a ship of the line, they\u2019d be annihilated.  Naval Warfare at the time would then more usually be between a ship of the line and two or three frigates. They could last several days, mostly with the frigates chasing down the ship of the line or merchantman. The conquering ships generally did not want to destroy the conquered ship, as it would be very valuable in price money, as the royal navy would essentially buy the captured ship of the crew that captured it. For an able seaman or petty officer, this could be enough to retire, if a frigate managed to capture a merchantman. Thus the battles were deadly but generally not lethal, as the target was to get them to surrender. Navy\u2019s would have been spread quite thin, trying to cover global interests.  The other notable pitch battle then is right at the end of this era. The battle of Trafalgar. This was a decisive moment in the Napoleonic war. It prevented a French invasion of Britain, and effectively removed the French navy as any kind of force for decades. As an aside to the prize money aspect. The French were exceeding good at building ships, but rubbish at sailing them. And over half of the British Navy at the battle were French made ships, previously captured and pressed into service for the Royal Navy.  The total compliment (Sailing crew, gun crews, officers and marines) for the would have been of the order of 13,000-20,000 (I can\u2019t find the exact number, but Nelson\u2019s flagship Victory had a compliment of 850 for scale, there were 2-3 ships which were larger than the Victory).  Casualties were relatively high due to Nelson\u2019s tactics of sailing his ships straight at the French/Spanish line. A particularly vulnerable thing to do, as they\u2019d be sailing directly into the enemy broadside for over an hour before they would retaliate. The ships in the vanguard of the two columns bore the brunt of this, particularly in the leeward (down-wind) column which was the engaged the French sooner (thus forcing them to disengage from the windward column allowing them final approach relatively unmolested.)  None the less the leading ships took c. 20% casualties. (there is a great chart on Wikipedia of casualty rates on each ship). Most of the windward column suffered less than 10% casualties. The French and Spanish navies suffered much higher casualties. With Redoutable suffering 90% casualties.  In the end there were 458 British dead (<5%) and c3,300 French and Spanish dead (c. 15%), and double that again wounded on each side. Only 5 of the combined navy ships returned to sea, out of 41. 21 further ships were captured by the British. Only one ship was actually destroyed (the Redoutable was scuttled, due to extensive damage sustained). Another 3000 men were lost in a storm after the battle.  This is one of the most decisive and bloody battles in naval history prior to WW2 in the Pacific. Nelson\u2019s sole intent was to remove the French navy as an effective force, and he was willing to throw as many men as necessary at that goal. Nelson and Gravina (the Spanish C-in-C) were both killed in action. Compare this with the total annihilation of Hannibal by the Romans to achieve the same goal.  On casualty rates, these would include crew injured and wounded. The primary cause of injury, fatal or otherwise, were splinters, as cannon balls smashed through the hulls, they\u2019d shower the lower decks with splinters, some as big as your forearm. These left horrific injuries, often requiring amputation of limbs in order to have a clean wound to cauterise and sew shut. A lot of the fatalities would have been men who bleed out before they saw the surgeon, and few would have died instantly. The caricature of eye patch and peg leg was not too far removed from reality, though generally in sovereign navies only officers could afford to not have all limbs, some crew men could serve effectively whilst dismembered, but most would be discharged.  Still, set piece battles like this were still extremely rare. The only other battle of the same scale as the battle of Trafalgar during Nelson\u2019s era was the Battle of the Nile, whereas Wellington, in the same wars fought dozens of battles. Most of naval life was taken up with the business of sailing, and skirmishes between 2-4 ships would have been much more common. In these example, the ships with the upper hand would have been fairly obvious at any point, and when the position finally became untenable the weaker ship would usually capitulate if the fight was between two countries. More sailors were lost to disease and the high seas.   Against outright pirates, they usually fought to the death, because it was less horrific to die to a sword then 1000 lashes, or keel hauling, the usual punishments for pirates. Some pirates crew men might be pressed into service within the sovereign navies.  There is a further category of ships. Privateers. These were pirates who had been given Letters of Marque by a country. Essentially commissions in those countries navies\u2019 to capture and harass trade shipping of foreign powers, on their own dime. They would do this for the prize money, which as mentioned, could be substantial. They were theoretically offered the same protections as crew and officers from those sovereign navies, but often were not worth the paper they were written on if captured"

The fleet would have to break out of Brest, sail to Vannes to pick up the transports, and then evade the British fleet to land troops somewhere in Britain, which was a tall order.  >The French were increasingly desperate to break out of port as 1759 drew to a close, and when a westerly gale blew Hawke off station in November, the French acted. The same day that the storm died down and Hawke left Torbay, the French left Brest. They were blown far to the west before they could come about and head for Vannes, and had trouble with the fleet because many of its men were inexperienced at sea after being bottled up in port. They sailed for Quiberon Bay, where the transports waited, with the British fleet on their heels, and made it almost there before sighting the British fleet. The French gambled that the British would not follow them into Quiberon Bay, because the British lacked charts of the area, but Hawke attacked at once and the French fleet fled. The British caught up with the tail end of the French fleet just as the van was entering the bay, and at that point the wind backed and headed the French, as well as kicking up an extremely rough sea.  >The battle was a disaster for the French; the Thesee sank attempting to open its lower gunports (the ship flooded) and the Superbe sank after two broadsides from Hawke's flagship. One French ship was captured; three were trapped in the Vilaine river with their guns thrown overboard to lighten ship; and six were wrecked or sunk. Two British ships were also driven ashore and wrecked, but their crews were rescued.  British casualties were about 400 men killed, against French of 2,500 lost in battle and/or drowned.   The best-known battles of the age of sail, of course, were Nelson's three victories at the Nile, Copenhagen, and Trafalgar. I've written about the Nile here and Trafalgar here -- casualties in both battles were quite high.   Of course, that doesn't also mean there were engagements with fewer! The famous action between *HMS Speedy* and the Spanish ship *Gamo* ended with the British losing three killed and nine wounded, in capturing a much larger ship with 14 killed and 41 wounded (more men than were on board *Speedy*).   I'm going to need to stop here for now, but I will come back later and expand!",
        "rejected_target": " I\u2019m not a historian of the era, but a fan. Also British, so sorry for the bias in my knowledge.  The era you are talking about really fits between the late 16th century, and the early to mid 19th century. Prior to this era, the battles concerned themselves with trying to board the other vessels, hence the Spanish Galleons that typified the time had very high fore- and aft-castles, to gain the high ground, so to speak. This era ended with the introduction of steel armoured ships (The French Gloire being the first in 1859), and gun turrets (USS Monitor - 1862) rather than broadsides.  In the late 15th century, Britain developed a compact gun carriage, It invention is sometimes attributed to Henry VIII. This is the type of gun carriage you see in historic vessels, and on shows like Hornblower. Prior to this Field guns, with large wheel carriages were install on ships. The smaller carriages meant that the guns could recoil further, allowing for larger calibres and much faster reload speeds.  The efficacy of this invention was demonstrated during the Spanish Armada, with the Spanish still using the old field gun carriages, and the English using the new compact carriages. One pitch battles, where the English lost no ships to combat (8 fire ships to burn the Spanish out of port to actually fight them).  The Spanish lost over 600 dead in the battle of Gravelines plus 800 wounded (out of 7000 sailors and 17000 soldiers). 5 ships were sunk, but most of the Spanish fleet was severely damaged. If they had been modern warships with that much damage they\u2019d have sunk, but fundamentally wood floats. Overall the Spanish lost c.20,000 of 24,000 on that campaign, mostly lost to the high seas taking the long way back over the top of Scotland and Ireland. The English lost only a maximum of 100 to combat (6-8000 to disease chasing the Spanish over the top.) From the dead in the battle at least it shows that the new carriage was 6x more lethal.  This was a bit of a theme from pitch battles at the time, the tail of the butchers bill was usually higher then the bill during combat, as badly damaged ships succumbed to high seas, or crew fell ill in foetid conditions.  Thus during this era, naval battle was global, and a lot of the skills centered around navigation and being able to bring your guns to bear. Hear generally the English, then British, excelled as the song would have it \u201cBritannia rules the waves\u201d. They employed frigates as the were faster, and more manouverable, and more that a match for a merchant ship. Generally if they were unlucky enough to be cornered by a ship of the line, they\u2019d be annihilated.  Naval Warfare at the time would then more usually be between a ship of the line and two or three frigates. They could last several days, mostly with the frigates chasing down the ship of the line or merchantman. The conquering ships generally did not want to destroy the conquered ship, as it would be very valuable in price money, as the royal navy would essentially buy the captured ship of the crew that captured it. For an able seaman or petty officer, this could be enough to retire, if a frigate managed to capture a merchantman. Thus the battles were deadly but generally not lethal, as the target was to get them to surrender. Navy\u2019s would have been spread quite thin, trying to cover global interests.  The other notable pitch battle then is right at the end of this era. The battle of Trafalgar. This was a decisive moment in the Napoleonic war. It prevented a French invasion of Britain, and effectively removed the French navy as any kind of force for decades. As an aside to the prize money aspect. The French were exceeding good at building ships, but rubbish at sailing them. And over half of the British Navy at the battle were French made ships, previously captured and pressed into service for the Royal Navy.  The total compliment (Sailing crew, gun crews, officers and marines) for the would have been of the order of 13,000-20,000 (I can\u2019t find the exact number, but Nelson\u2019s flagship Victory had a compliment of 850 for scale, there were 2-3 ships which were larger than the Victory).  Casualties were relatively high due to Nelson\u2019s tactics of sailing his ships straight at the French/Spanish line. A particularly vulnerable thing to do, as they\u2019d be sailing directly into the enemy broadside for over an hour before they would retaliate. The ships in the vanguard of the two columns bore the brunt of this, particularly in the leeward (down-wind) column which was the engaged the French sooner (thus forcing them to disengage from the windward column allowing them final approach relatively unmolested.)  None the less the leading ships took c. 20% casualties. (there is a great chart on Wikipedia of casualty rates on each ship). Most of the windward column suffered less than 10% casualties. The French and Spanish navies suffered much higher casualties. With Redoutable suffering 90% casualties.  In the end there were 458 British dead (<5%) and c3,300 French and Spanish dead (c. 15%), and double that again wounded on each side. Only 5 of the combined navy ships returned to sea, out of 41. 21 further ships were captured by the British. Only one ship was actually destroyed (the Redoutable was scuttled, due to extensive damage sustained). Another 3000 men were lost in a storm after the battle.  This is one of the most decisive and bloody battles in naval history prior to WW2 in the Pacific. Nelson\u2019s sole intent was to remove the French navy as an effective force, and he was willing to throw as many men as necessary at that goal. Nelson and Gravina (the Spanish C-in-C) were both killed in action. Compare this with the total annihilation of Hannibal by the Romans to achieve the same goal.  On casualty rates, these would include crew injured and wounded. The primary cause of injury, fatal or otherwise, were splinters, as cannon balls smashed through the hulls, they\u2019d shower the lower decks with splinters, some as big as your forearm. These left horrific injuries, often requiring amputation of limbs in order to have a clean wound to cauterise and sew shut. A lot of the fatalities would have been men who bleed out before they saw the surgeon, and few would have died instantly. The caricature of eye patch and peg leg was not too far removed from reality, though generally in sovereign navies only officers could afford to not have all limbs, some crew men could serve effectively whilst dismembered, but most would be discharged.  Still, set piece battles like this were still extremely rare. The only other battle of the same scale as the battle of Trafalgar during Nelson\u2019s era was the Battle of the Nile, whereas Wellington, in the same wars fought dozens of battles. Most of naval life was taken up with the business of sailing, and skirmishes between 2-4 ships would have been much more common. In these example, the ships with the upper hand would have been fairly obvious at any point, and when the position finally became untenable the weaker ship would usually capitulate if the fight was between two countries. More sailors were lost to disease and the high seas.   Against outright pirates, they usually fought to the death, because it was less horrific to die to a sword then 1000 lashes, or keel hauling, the usual punishments for pirates. Some pirates crew men might be pressed into service within the sovereign navies.  There is a further category of ships. Privateers. These were pirates who had been given Letters of Marque by a country. Essentially commissions in those countries navies\u2019 to capture and harass trade shipping of foreign powers, on their own dime. They would do this for the prize money, which as mentioned, could be substantial. They were theoretically offered the same protections as crew and officers from those sovereign navies, but often were not worth the paper they were written on if captured"

            " This is one of those questions that is very hard to answer, but an interesting one (there are no inconsequential questions!). One window into the SF-nerd response to *Galactica*\u2019s premiere is via the magazine *Starlog* (fair warning- Archive.org has the entire print run digitized here - I\u2019m not responsible for time lost down this internet rabbit hole!). Staffed by some hardcore American SF fans and launching in the mid-1970s, *Starlog* was one of the major mainstream sources of information about SF and fantasy media. The magazine ran episode guides, interviews with cast and crew, special effects layouts, and other material not commonly available. Letters to the editor not only weighed in on the merits of various movies, but also asked such minutia like whether or not Patrick McNee did *Battlestar*\u2019s voiceover (he didn\u2019t) or what was the main unit of measurement used in the series. *Starlog*\u2019s main articles could veer into uncritical fluff. For example, one of the issues mentioned below excitedly reports that Star Wars coming to television screens soon in a holiday special complete with photos of Lumpy and the other Wookies celebrating Life Day. Nonetheless, the magazine\u2019s editors and commentators could strike an occasionally critical tone and *Battlestar* was not immune to this occasional censure.  *Starlog*\u2019s editor in chief Howard Zimmerman\u2019s column \u201cLast Word,\u201d was decidedly critical of the pilot and initial episodes in Issue 019. Zimmerman wrote:  >It\u2019s hard to decide whether my basic reaction to ABC\u2019s *Battlestar Galactica* is anger or incredulity; I guess it\u2019s equal parts of both. At the time I write this, the first six hours of the show have aired: the initial three-hour movie, a two-hour film broken into two parts, and one hour-long episode. I\u2019ve seen more than enough. The three-hour premiere suffered from script and film editing problems and an overall sense of confusion. So many lines and scenes raised my hackles that I can\u2019t go into them all.  After raising up a few plot holes, Zimmerman notes \u201cthe sad truth is that the plot inconsistencies are only part of the problem. There is no science background in the show whatsoever.\u201d He concluded his editorial by noting that while *Star Trek* started out as a \u201c*Wagon Train* to the stars,\u201d the show managed to transcend this limitation when \u201cthe role of the *science officer* was expanded [emphasis original,\u201d and its scripts explored legitimate SF concepts.   While Zimmerman\u2019s critique was harsh, he did hold up hope that *Battlestar* could live up to *Star Trek*\u2019s success. David Gerrold, one of *Star Trek*\u2019s writers, did not see much potential in *Battlestar*. In his column \u201cHope-The Human Challenge,\u201d in Issue 026 which was written after the news of *Battlestar*\u2019s cancellation broke, Gerrold noted that the reason both *Battlestar* and its British contemporary *Space:1999* failed directly reflects the reasons for *Star Trek*\u2019s enduring popularity: hope in humanity\u2019s future. Both the cancelled shows showed humanity with its back against the wall amidst a hostile universe, which he contended made these shows not  reflection of the future, but instead a reflection of the malaise of the 1970s. Gerrold contends that:  >The premise[in *Battlestar*] is even less honorable: \u201cThey\u2019re after us! Let\u2019s run like hell!\u201d Perhaps this is why *Battlestar Galactica* has been cancelled. When the viewing audience began to realize these people were not going to find a place to stand and fight back, they lost interest. Who can really care about a show that has cowardice as a part of its basic format? That one simple change, perhaps- letting these survivors find a planet and fight to defend it- might have been enough to save the show. At the very least, it would have provided a reason to care about these people. And that reason would have been called *hope* [Emphasis original].  Both Zimmerman and Gerold damned with faint praise *Battlestar*\u2019s expensive special effects (which were extensively covered in various *Starlog* issues), but warned that effects were no substitute for story, and used *Star Trek* as a benchmark example.   Of course, not all of *Starlog*\u2019s readers agreed with these critical assessments. Zimmerman \u201cLast Word,\u201d in Issue 020 remarked that \u201cMy last editorial on this space opera prompted many readers to write highly emotional letters in defense of the show.\u201dSome of the published letters took issue with Zimmerman\u2019s excessive criticism. Tom Sorlie\u2019s letter in Issue 021 argues that \u201c*Battlestar Galactica* isn\u2019t the only show with faults. All shows have faults. (Yes, even *Trek* has mistakes, trekkies!)\u201d Other letters, while not mentioning *Battlestar*, complained that *Starlog* had a clear pro-*Trek* bias that colored its coverage of new SF. Despite this defense, Zimmerman\u2019s critique of *Battlestar* struck a chord with some readers. Mark Shepherd\u2019s letter in Issue 21 attacked Glen Larson\u2019s privileging of spectacle over substance:  > .There is one fact that is glaring and certainly one of the wonders of Hollywood \u2014 the (*Galactica*) scripts. Granted Glen Larson wanted to do  the job solo, but, er, Glen, it just isn't working. How nice it would indeed be to have culled mainstream writers into this from the start. Consider: The script is the most important element in the world of visuals, and on TV it is the cheapest to come by. Low man on the totem pole is the screenwriter. The smallest part of the budget\u2026  While *Starlog*\u2019s editorial and reader letters are not a comprehensive source about fandom\u2019s response to *Battlestar Galactica*, it was one of the major SF publications of the era. Some clear *Star Trek* partisans like Zimmerman compared Larson\u2019s creation to Roddenberry\u2019s and found the former quite lacking. Not every reader of *Starlog* agreed with this negative assessment, as evidence by letters defending the show and the simple fact that *Starlog* continued to run positive articles on *Battlestar*\u2019s actors and special effects as well as advertisements for official *Battlestar* merchandise well after the show\u2019s cancellation became common knowledge.

            " I researched this event extensively for my first novel and I'm happy to share what I found.      The program you're talking about was *The Adventures of Superman* which aired from 1940 through 1951 and was sponsored by Kellogg's Pep Cereal (that's going to be important in this story later). Keen comic book historians will note that this show began airing a mere two years after Superman's first comic book appearance in 1938 (Action Comics #1). This shows just how quickly Superman, and the whole concept of superheroes, had risen in popularity (in the wake of Superman, you had Batman, the Human Torch, Namor, and many lesser known debuts before the '30s ended). By the mid-40s, the entire nation was obsessed with superheroes and, of that group, Superman was king.     Of course, one of the biggest reasons for Superman's rapid rise of popularity (and superheroes in general) was WWII. In every iteration (comic book, newspaper strip, radio show), Superman battled Nazis and Axis powers and bolstered the morale of American boys and girls nervous about the fates of their fathers and brothers overseas. It was the perfect combination, a villain so powerful and evil it could only be met by a hero with superpowers.      And then the War ended in 1945 and the creators of these superhero stories were faced with a dilemma. Whom would the most powerful beings in the world face now that Hitler was gone?      Enter human rights activist and author Stetson Kennedy. Kennedy wanted to expose the inner workings of the Ku Klux Klan to the world and so infiltrated the Klan and recorded everything he witnessed. (It should be noted that the Klan during the '40s is considered the Second Klan, and was different from the Klan of the '60s or the Klan of the 1800s. The nation was greatly divided in their opinions about the Klan and many associated the Klan with fascism) Kennedy took all of his notes exposing illegal activity on the part of the Klan to the police, however the local police refused to do anything about it, reportedly because the Klan had infiltrated the police force.      And so you had a group of writers looking for a new villain comparable to the Nazis and an activist wanting to expose a group many saw as fascists in America. It was a match made in heaven.      \"The Clan of the Fiery Cross\" was a fifteen part series that aired in  1946. In the story, an Asian-american kid named Tommy Lee needs Superman's help as he and his family are facing opposition from a mysterious group that wears hoods and terrorizes the minority community. In the series, the writers used the information given to them by Kennedy, including code words, strategies, etc. and built a villain that was recognizable to their audience. And the audience loved it.      And the Klan did not. The Klan petitioned Kellogg's to order the writers to stop the series or drop the show all together. But the reaction of the public was so unbelievably positive, Kellogg's denied the claim. This would prove to be a fatal blow to the Second Klan. The entire organization fell apart on a national level and, from the '50s through the '60s, any Klans that rose up were local groups with no true national leadership. And when the Klan rose up, they faced a reality that America now viewed them as comic book status villains instead of the freedom fighters they had hoped to portray themselves as.      One trivia item of note, you talked about how Superman had as association with \"all-American\" values, and you probably think of the phrase \"Truth, Justice, and the American way.\" The tag on, \"The American way,\" wasn't included in the radio show and only became part of the Superman vernacular until much later.

In other words, on /r/AskHistorians, we'd rather have no answer than bad attempts at answers. By deleting short, quick, bad answers, the well-researched in-depth answers (that take people time to research and write) are more likely to be seen. The downside to this is that we have to remove a lot of shitposts and comments wondering what happened to the removed comments. The upside is that our contributors post amazing stuff to /r/AskHistorians (which we collate the best of every week in our Sunday Digest).  Additionally, if you're waiting for an answer to this really interesting question, please be patient: we have found that it takes an average of 9 hours for a good answer to appear on a popular thread - properly researching and writing an answer takes time. If you want to be reminded of this thread in a few days, please see here for information on how to send a **private message** to RemindMeBot to remind you about this thread (we'll remove it if you post in this thread). Alternatively, if you want to discuss history without these constraints, /r/history or /r/askhistory might be a more appropriate subreddit for you than /r/AskHistorians.",
            " There is a spectacular book on exactly this subject, and if it truly interest you I suggest you get it. The name is \"Superman Versus the Ku Klux Klan\" by Richard Bower. Most of the information I can give here stems from that source, along with some common historical knowledge one can find at sources such as Supermanhomepage.com. That site is a great source for information on the caped crusader, but I always ensure any statement I make from an internet source (that is not a .org, .gov, or .edu) is triple verified; which is to say I must be able to find matching stories from at least 3 non-wiki web sources. The main three I used for this were the one stated above, Otrcat.com, and from listening to some of the actual program, which is also available on  otrcat, an other places.  Also, in a sidenote, the kkk arc was one piece of a broader agenda the radio program was pushing around this time in the form of 4 arcs (called together \"the unity house\" arcs.) That promoted American values of freedom, and equality for all Americans in a time where post war disgruntlment was rearing its ugly head.  I will answer the second half of your question first. By 1946, the year \"Clan of the Fiery Cross\" first aired, Superman the radio series had already been running for  six years, five days a week. He was very well known, had been chopping down Nazis, Italian Fascists, and anti-Semitism for years to this point. Some of the most highly rated episodes were in the story arcs called \"The New German Weapon.\",  And \"German Submarine Menace.\" the radio hour was many families evening program as they heard all the men who caused fear get trounced by this All-American Superman. The famous \"It's a bird, It's a plane\" line had it's beginnings in the radio show, his weakness to Kryptonite was created to give his voice actor, Bud Collyer, the ability to take time off in 1943; the persona of a reedy voiced Clark Kent changing into the baritone Superman was created by the voice actor even!  Superman was by this point definitely the superhero we envision today, mostly thanks to this program itself.   Now to backstory of the story arc.   By 1946 Superman was back to fighting supervillains and people were losing interest. The war was over, Superman defeated all the real evil, what was left to listen to? Luckily for the producers a southern journalist by the name of Stetson Kennedy was looking for an outlet to do real good, and just so happened to be infiltrating the KKK under a false name (that of a dead uncle who had been a member).  By this point, Stetson had turned over the information to authorities, even got the klan sued by the irs for $685,000 in tax dues in April 1944, which caused them to legally disband by June of 1944 (https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Ku_Klux_Klan_in_Virginia#its5). But he was frustrated, and fearful, as local authorities were either too afraid to act or worse were supporters/members of the klan, so he turned to the one national name he knew could stop them: Superman.  Stetson approached the creators and gave them what he said was inside information; handshakes, codewords, meeting places. He helped the writers make the storyline creating a thinly veiled interpretation called \"the clan of the fiery cross,\" and from there the rest is, well, history.   Which brings us to the point of how this was taken, both In the South and elsewhere.  The Klan did not, as you could expect, take this well. Especially the end, where it is revealed that the leadership is nothing but shills spreading hate they don't believe to make money selling robes to rubes. This, along with the codewords and other aspects of the organization presented made the group lose its mystique, and soon enrollment began to plummet.  There were calls for boycotts, by the klan, on the serials cereal sponsor Kellogg's PEP (this is the era of sponsored programs. like the original soap operas presented by soap brands aimed at housewives). But, that only further weakened The group, as it gave substance to the idea that the odd codewords and other aspects said on the program hit a little to close to reality for them to feel comfortable.  The story was such a hit nationally that Kellogg was not intimidated, and stood by their political stance. It was a huge uptick in listeners compared to the previous arcs. The show went on to have mostly good ratings and continued support until it's end in 1951.  I hope this gave you everything you were looking for.",
            " I researched this event extensively for my first novel and I'm happy to share what I found.      The program you're talking about was *The Adventures of Superman* which aired from 1940 through 1951 and was sponsored by Kellogg's Pep Cereal (that's going to be important in this story later). Keen comic book historians will note that this show began airing a mere two years after Superman's first comic book appearance in 1938 (Action Comics #1). This shows just how quickly Superman, and the whole concept of superheroes, had risen in popularity (in the wake of Superman, you had Batman, the Human Torch, Namor, and many lesser known debuts before the '30s ended). By the mid-40s, the entire nation was obsessed with superheroes and, of that group, Superman was king.     Of course, one of the biggest reasons for Superman's rapid rise of popularity (and superheroes in general) was WWII. In every iteration (comic book, newspaper strip, radio show), Superman battled Nazis and Axis powers and bolstered the morale of American boys and girls nervous about the fates of their fathers and brothers overseas. It was the perfect combination, a villain so powerful and evil it could only be met by a hero with superpowers.      And then the War ended in 1945 and the creators of these superhero stories were faced with a dilemma. Whom would the most powerful beings in the world face now that Hitler was gone?      Enter human rights activist and author Stetson Kennedy. Kennedy wanted to expose the inner workings of the Ku Klux Klan to the world and so infiltrated the Klan and recorded everything he witnessed. (It should be noted that the Klan during the '40s is considered the Second Klan, and was different from the Klan of the '60s or the Klan of the 1800s. The nation was greatly divided in their opinions about the Klan and many associated the Klan with fascism) Kennedy took all of his notes exposing illegal activity on the part of the Klan to the police, however the local police refused to do anything about it, reportedly because the Klan had infiltrated the police force.      And so you had a group of writers looking for a new villain comparable to the Nazis and an activist wanting to expose a group many saw as fascists in America. It was a match made in heaven.      \"The Clan of the Fiery Cross\" was a fifteen part series that aired in  1946. In the story, an Asian-american kid named Tommy Lee needs Superman's help as he and his family are facing opposition from a mysterious group that wears hoods and terrorizes the minority community. In the series, the writers used the information given to them by Kennedy, including code words, strategies, etc. and built a villain that was recognizable to their audience. And the audience loved it.      And the Klan did not. The Klan petitioned Kellogg's to order the writers to stop the series or drop the show all together. But the reaction of the public was so unbelievably positive, Kellogg's denied the claim. This would prove to be a fatal blow to the Second Klan. The entire organization fell apart on a national level and, from the '50s through the '60s, any Klans that rose up were local groups with no true national leadership. And when the Klan rose up, they faced a reality that America now viewed them as comic book status villains instead of the freedom fighters they had hoped to portray themselves as.      One trivia item of note, you talked about how Superman had as association with \"all-American\" values, and you probably think of the phrase \"Truth, Justice, and the American way.\" The tag on, \"The American way,\" wasn't included in the radio show and only became part of the Superman vernacular until much later.

            " Great question! Unfortunately (or fortunately), it straddles different topics, eras, and historiography which makes it an adventure to answer and difficult to give you a single answer. This doesn't mean it can't be done, but in the spirit of Ask Historians, an answer about the layers of history in your question. And then an attempt at an answer.  First, there's the matter of what we can infer from children\u2019s behavior centuries ago based on what adults put down in writing and which writing endured. There\u2019s the use of your word \u201ctoddler\u201d which is a fairly modernish term (usage dates to the late 1700) that describes a human in a particular stage of development distinct from previous or subsequent stages; and this notion of distinct stages has its own history. Then there's the specificity in your question around the \u201cterrible twos\u201d which is a very short window of time in a human\u2019s life about which an adult may or may not write. (I feel comfortable saying two-year-olds medieval toddlers weren't keeping food and behavior journals.) Finally, there\u2019s how the adults around the child constructed boundaries for behaviors and how they vary in terms of what\u2019s considered an inappropriate tantrum or an appropriate expression of independence. These boundaries are shaped by a society\u2019s \u2013 be it modern or medieval \u2013 thinking about gender, disability status, race, religion, class, the nature of childhood itself, the expectation of children, and in the case of your question, dietary habits.   It's helpful to spend a bit more time thinking about one of the challenges in your question: your precision. It's a great detail, but alas, it makes it a bit harder to answer as a historian of the medieval era can probably shed some light on the eating habits of toddlers but likely won\u2019t be able to explicitly say \u201cyes, this thing happened\u201d because the adults who wrote about children wouldn\u2019t have used your level of precision.   I often experience similar tensions in American education history, I can rattle off anecdotes I've come across from teacher journals from the mid-1800s where a child is described as misbehaving (her words), but the child\u2019s age is often not noted (\u201cthe youngest Smith boy\u201d) or is described in the context of when they attended school (\u201cwinter session.\u201d) However, I also know that her journal writing is informed by the social pressure she experienced related to how well she did her job. So, it's difficult to know for sure if what she's describing as \"misbehavior\" was the sort of thing children did because they're children or truly something dangerous or harmful. And to complicate it, the same teacher might write home that the same child was an absolute hellion to her but through sheer force of will and motherly instincts, she was able to calm him down and teach him his letters. And of by the way, if the school board was interested in buying new books for the school, she knows this particular boy simply loves to read. Which is to say, she's a bit of an unreliable narrator with regards to the things children in her charge did. So, if you asked, \"have 7-year-old boys always hated school?\" I couldn't say for sure. I could tell you there are instances of teachers reporting boys around age 7 or so did not like doing the thing they asked them to do.   Although related in historiography and themes to the history of education, there is a separate branch of historians who study the history of childhood and youth. It's their work that can help us understand the imprecision regarding age I described above is not a universal trait. As an example, Berner (2014) looked at the rituals in the lives of Ashkenazic Jews in the 1700s and could describe down to particular years how children were treated because a child's age played a role in the rituals of the community. From her 2014 article: \"very young infants were often brought to the synagogue, bringing toddlers and children under the age of three or five was usually discouraged.\" So it's possible a historian of Ashkenazic Jewish childhood could speculate how two-year-olds might have responded to food they disliked, but it's difficult for us to extrapolate from one community to the broad category of human two-year-olds across an entire extended era.   Finally, there's the issue of taste. That is, this idea we wouldn't eat something - or allow a toddler to pick and choose - because of the taste or flavor has its own complicated history that I dipped my toe in and promptly turned around. Perhaps a food historian can chime in on the history of food for toddlers - but again, it would difficult for us to extrapolate from taste to behavior to patterns over time.   That said, I'm going to go out on a limb and say no. To be sure, historians can look at the historical record and reach different conclusions. It happens routinely and is, in truth, one of my favorite parts of \"doing\" history. So, it's entirely possible someone is writing another post in which they say, \"yes, and here's what leads me to that conclusion.\" I, however, am going to say no, and here's why.  It's very possible that a two-year-old in 1066, when faced when a spoon full of food, offered a very strong opinion that indicated they did not want to eat that food, thank you very much. And given what we know about universalities of human development, it's very likely they did. However, the heart of your question is how the adults responded, not what the child did. The very notion of a tantrum is a fairly modern - 20th century - concept. That is, the idea of toddler expressing their opinion strongly and vocally in response to a request for an adult deserves its own name (\"tantrum\") emerged from the idea that there is \"typical\" child behavior - or normal and abnormal behavior that needs to be redressed.   I wrote about the field of Child Study in response to the question, \"What is the history behind \"What is your favorite color?\"\" and the movement's impact can be seen in your question, and in fact, the curiosity behind your question. In effect, they asked the same thing you're asking: why do small humans do these things that big humans don't? The founder of the movement, a man named G. Stanley Hall, was fascinated by this idea that the attributes of childhood could be observed and studied in the same way scientists studied the natural world. This isn't to say adults before the Hall came along in the late 1800s weren't curious about children's motivations - or had opinions - but rather, Hall created structures that gave rise to developmental psychology, child psychiatry, and societies for Mental Hygiene focused on children's behavior.   While adults in previous eras would and could describe children's behavior on a continuum or scale in relation to their siblings or other children, what Hall and his contemporaries did was related to scale and norming. They collected thousands of anecdotes about children, detailing everything toddlers did and wrote about patterns. The field of child psychology encouraged doctors and parents to frame children's behaviors as good or bad, healthy or unhealthy. Kathleen Jones 1999 book, *Taming the troublesome child: American families, child guidance, and the limits of psychiatric authority.* goes into more detail about how this history evolved and explores how the theories behind a child's \"tantrum\" ran the gauntlet from \"their mother gave them too much attention as a baby\" to \"their mother didn't give them enough attention as a baby.\" Public health, especially child health, was a very popular social issue in the early 1900s and doctors around the warned of disastrous events if a child's bad behavior weren't fixed. Thus, tantrums became something to be handled and fixed, rather than something children did.   Which is to say, did medieval toddlers strongly and vocally express their opinions about food? Probably. Did parents see such opinions as abnormal behavior that needed to be handled? Likely not.    ________ Berner, T. (2014).

            " While we wait for a genuine expert in medieval history to show up, I will mention first that there is a fantastic 2009 publication that speaks somewhat to this query, edited by Kathleen Ashley and Mark Johnston, entitled Medieval Conduct Literature: An Anthology of Vernacular Guides to Conduct for Youths.  As a non-specialist in medieval history, I do note three things in reading over the introduction to this book. First, that the genre of \"conduct literature\" was well-established by the late medieval period and had its roots in late antiquity, and often consisted of advice from a parental figure or elder to a putative child (though frequently a teenager on the verge of leaving the household). Second, that the oldest and best-established sub-genre within conduct literature concerned table manners--but it focused on the nobility and gentry. Third, no matter what your field of speciality, any historian would be instantly alert to a difficult problem of interpretation, namely, whether these guides were prescriptive ideals that bore little resemblance to actual manners, or whether they can safely be used as a window into everyday behavior. Anyone familiar with etiquette guides in a more contemporary idiom has doubtless noticed that sometimes they are a reasonable enough guide to common manners and other times seem basically like fictions with very little resemblance to actual practice. In any event, these guides will likely provide very little help for answering the OP's question if the OP is interested in everyday life outside of the late medieval nobility. There we will need the full methodological skills of an expert in medieval social and cultural history to have any hope of an answer."

Perhaps a food historian can chime in on the history of food for toddlers - but again, it would difficult for us to extrapolate from taste to behavior to patterns over time.   That said, I'm going to go out on a limb and say no. To be sure, historians can look at the historical record and reach different conclusions. It happens routinely and is, in truth, one of my favorite parts of \"doing\" history. So, it's entirely possible someone is writing another post in which they say, \"yes, and here's what leads me to that conclusion.\" I, however, am going to say no, and here's why.  It's very possible that a two-year-old in 1066, when faced when a spoon full of food, offered a very strong opinion that indicated they did not want to eat that food, thank you very much. And given what we know about universalities of human development, it's very likely they did. However, the heart of your question is how the adults responded, not what the child did. The very notion of a tantrum is a fairly modern - 20th century - concept. That is, the idea of toddler expressing their opinion strongly and vocally in response to a request for an adult deserves its own name (\"tantrum\") emerged from the idea that there is \"typical\" child behavior - or normal and abnormal behavior that needs to be redressed.   I wrote about the field of Child Study in response to the question, \"What is the history behind \"What is your favorite color?\"\" and the movement's impact can be seen in your question, and in fact, the curiosity behind your question. In effect, they asked the same thing you're asking: why do small humans do these things that big humans don't? The founder of the movement, a man named G. Stanley Hall, was fascinated by this idea that the attributes of childhood could be observed and studied in the same way scientists studied the natural world. This isn't to say adults before the Hall came along in the late 1800s weren't curious about children's motivations - or had opinions - but rather, Hall created structures that gave rise to developmental psychology, child psychiatry, and societies for Mental Hygiene focused on children's behavior.   While adults in previous eras would and could describe children's behavior on a continuum or scale in relation to their siblings or other children, what Hall and his contemporaries did was related to scale and norming. They collected thousands of anecdotes about children, detailing everything toddlers did and wrote about patterns. The field of child psychology encouraged doctors and parents to frame children's behaviors as good or bad, healthy or unhealthy. Kathleen Jones 1999 book, *Taming the troublesome child: American families, child guidance, and the limits of psychiatric authority.* goes into more detail about how this history evolved and explores how the theories behind a child's \"tantrum\" ran the gauntlet from \"their mother gave them too much attention as a baby\" to \"their mother didn't give them enough attention as a baby.\" Public health, especially child health, was a very popular social issue in the early 1900s and doctors around the warned of disastrous events if a child's bad behavior weren't fixed. Thus, tantrums became something to be handled and fixed, rather than something children did.   Which is to say, did medieval toddlers strongly and vocally express their opinions about food? Probably. Did parents see such opinions as abnormal behavior that needed to be handled? Likely not.    ________ Berner, T. (2014).

        "rejected_target": " While we wait for a genuine expert in medieval history to show up, I will mention first that there is a fantastic 2009 publication that speaks somewhat to this query, edited by Kathleen Ashley and Mark Johnston, entitled Medieval Conduct Literature: An Anthology of Vernacular Guides to Conduct for Youths.  As a non-specialist in medieval history, I do note three things in reading over the introduction to this book. First, that the genre of \"conduct literature\" was well-established by the late medieval period and had its roots in late antiquity, and often consisted of advice from a parental figure or elder to a putative child (though frequently a teenager on the verge of leaving the household). Second, that the oldest and best-established sub-genre within conduct literature concerned table manners--but it focused on the nobility and gentry. Third, no matter what your field of speciality, any historian would be instantly alert to a difficult problem of interpretation, namely, whether these guides were prescriptive ideals that bore little resemblance to actual manners, or whether they can safely be used as a window into everyday behavior. Anyone familiar with etiquette guides in a more contemporary idiom has doubtless noticed that sometimes they are a reasonable enough guide to common manners and other times seem basically like fictions with very little resemblance to actual practice. In any event, these guides will likely provide very little help for answering the OP's question if the OP is interested in everyday life outside of the late medieval nobility. There we will need the full methodological skills of an expert in medieval social and cultural history to have any hope of an answer."

    "\n\nHuman: Did \"snipers\" exist before firearms? When we read about military archery, generally we only learn about archers firing mass volleys in the general direction of an enemy army.  Are there any examples from any culture of specialized military archery units tasked with taking precise aim at specific targets at long range?  I've heard plenty of stories of individual archers accomplishing such feats under various circumstances, but I'm not aware of any purpose-built precision archery forces from history.  It's possible to reliably strike human sized targets at 100 yards or more with primitive archery tackle, surely this would have come in handy from time to time, such as when a high ranking enemy came within range or a politician needed defending during a public appearance, etc.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " In Ancient Israel according to the biblical text,   >there were seven hundred picked men who were left-handed; every one could sling a stone at a hair, and not miss. *Judges 20:16, NRSV*  It's rather an unusual thing. Biblically, the only people who are mentioned as being left-handed are in a military context^1, and there is absolutely some linguistic shenanigans going on because all of them are from the tribe of Benjamin - which means 'Son of my **Right** Hand', which goes to show that even God enjoys irony.  But there appears to be no real benefit to being lefthanded in missile warfare so unless there is some other component that everybody is unaware of, it's a mystery (although see Eglon, where it absolutely was a Sneak Attack with a finesse weapon with critical (1d6+2d4), quite possibly on a *toilet* no less - eat your heart out Tyrion!).  There is an indication in the text that these are elite soldiers, who are capable of giving their Israelite cousins a run for their money in the Israelite Civil War. It's only the hand of Yahweh which causes them to lose, but that's pretty much the only indication of what they did with those crack troops.  There's no long distance slinging unless you count David vs Goliath, and there's not much indication of the distance.   ^1 For those interested the others are Ehud, the slayer of Eglon, the Ancient Near Eastern 'Fat Bastard' of his day, and another group of soldiers in 1 Chronicles 12:2 who could shoot with either bow or sling with either their right or left hand.",
            " The short version is no, they didn\u2019t really, at least not during the Middle Ages (I can\u2019t vouch for earlier, not my area). The medieval battlefield wasn\u2019t particularly well suited to long ranged precision archery \u2013 once everyone was in a melee there wasn\u2019t much opportunity to engage in specific targeted shooting without a huge risk of friendly fire. Archers in fact would often be armed with melee weapons of their own and might join in the fight once things got particularly intimate, leaving their shooting to either covering the advance of the army, forcing a repositioning or disadvantageous attack by enemy forces, or covering a retreating force (although retreating in good order wasn\u2019t particularly common in the Middle Ages so this was probably the rarest of all). In essence they were more of a support weapon than one suited to specific deadly killing \u2013 despite what some in the longbow-fandom might have you believe.   As for assassinations, that raises a more interesting question. I\u2019m going to limit my answer a bit by focusing on the crossbow because it\u2019s arguably the weapon better suited to this task. The crossbow was generally more accurate, much easier to aim, and had the advantage of being able to be loaded held ready while the archer lined up the perfect shot (in theory anyway). The crossbow was also used in a few famous assassinations and assassination attempts, a few of which I\u2019m going to discuss below.   Probably the most famous person ever to be killed by a crossbow is King Richard I of England. On the twenty-fifth of March 1199, King Richard I of England decided to patrol the walls of the Ch\u00e2teau de Ch\u00e2lus-Chabrol. He had been besieging the castle for some time and he may have decided that evening to inspect the progress of his sappers in their attempts to breach the castle\u2019s defences, we can\u2019t know for certain. Whatever his reason he very quickly would come to regret his decision as that evening he was shot by a crossbow wielded by one of the castle\u2019s defenders. Richard was transported back to his private tent, where the crossbow bolt was removed a process which, thanks to the dubious qualities of medieval medicine, badly mangled his arm. The wound soon became gangrenous. While the king lay dying in his camp his forces successfully completed the siege and put the defenders to the sword. Richard died on the sixth of April, just over a week after he had been initially wounded. His heart and entrails were buried in the castle\u2019s chapel and his body was transported Fontevraud Abbey in Anjou, where his father had been buried almost a decade earlier.   While King Richard has left us nothing in terms of a description of how he came to be mortally wounded the same cannot be said for contemporary historians. There are numerous accounts of the death of King Richard I \u2013 after all a king dying in a battle or siege was a fairly rare event even in the Middle Ages\u2013 from which we should be able to reconstruct the events of his death in greater detail. Unfortunately for historians, these accounts often disagree on major details and are often filled with errors \u2013 making constructing a single coherent narrative of the death of the king a difficult task. There are many interesting things to be learned from these accounts, though, and it is worth spending a time here exploring a few of the more interesting and informative ones.   Remarking on his death, the French chronicler William le Breton found a certain poetic irony to his fatal wounding by the crossbow, as he accused the vile Richard of having introduced this most sinful weapon to European warfare in the first place, making it only fitting that it be the tool to relieve Europe of his presence. This theory for the origins of the crossbow is patently false. The crossbow, along with the bow, had been banned in inter-Christian warfare at the Second Lateran Council in 1139, nearly twenty years before Richard was born. The ban obviously was not very effective, Richard\u2019s death is a pretty clear testimony to that, but the Lateran ban adds further confusion to the French chronicler\u2019s statement. It seems unlikely that he would be entirely ignorant of the decrees Council of a major papal council.   It is also interesting to note that this anecdote about Richard introducing the crossbow appears in only one of William le Breton\u2019s two accounts of Richard I\u2019s death. In William\u2019s *Gesta Philippi,* a prose chronicle about the life of King Philip II, he nearly exactly copies the version of events presented in the work of Rigord, another French chronicler who was writing a few decades before William. Rigord\u2019s account is not particularly in-depth and describes how Richard besieged the castle because he desired a recently discovered treasure \u2013 a treasure which Rigord describes as a golden figure of a Roman emperor \u2013 before he was shot and killed by an unknown crossbowmen.    It is in his *Philippidos* where William really lets his imagination run wild and the death of Richard I is a 200 line literary set piece that closes out Book V of this panegyric written to praise King Philip II of France in celebration of his victory at Bouvines in 1214. The relevant passage mentioned above comes as part of a 31-line speech delivered by one of the three Fates who has decided that while her sisters are still weaving Richard\u2019s life she feels it must end. She guides Lord Archard of Chalus \u2013 the lord of the castle and person who we are told found the treasure in the first place \u2013 to discover a hidden crossbow bolt because: \"This is how I want Richard to die, for it was he who first introduced the crossbow into France. Now let him suffer the fate he dealt out to others.\" This speech must be seen within the broader context of the work \u2013 the *Philippidos* is a work meant to praise Richard\u2019s long-time rival Philip II and as part of that work it frequently and vehemently condemns the English king in no uncertain terms. We are told that Richard I was killed because of his greed in demanding the treasure for himself despite no claim to it, and that he had no respect for God, broke treaties, and violated holy days. No crime is beneath Richard in this work, and so the suggestion that he was responsible for introducing the crossbow is just another exaggerated crime of the English king.   The English chronicler Roger of Howden wrote what is probably the most famous account of Richard\u2019s death and his confrontation with his killer. Roger of Howden was an English chronicler probably best known for accompanying Richard on the Third Crusade and providing a detailed account of the expedition. Roger tells us that Richard was outside Chalus Castle preparing for the imminent assault when he was shot by the crossbow, and upon being shot Richard rode back to camp and told the captain of his mercenaries to begin the assault without him. Roger tells us that Richard was shot by a man named Bertrannus de Gurdon and that when Richard learned that he would not survive he had Gurdon called before him \u2013 the castle having fallen by this stage and its defenders captured. We are told that Richard asked him: \"What wrong have I done to you that you should kill me?\" To which Gurdon responded: \"You killed my father and my two brothers and you wished to kill me. Take what vengeance you like. So long as you die I shall willingly suffer any torments you may devise.\" Roger says that Richard forgave Gurdon and ordered him be released, but upon the king\u2019s death the captain of his mercenaries, a man named Mercadier, had Gurdon captured and flayed alive. This narrative is probably the closest we come to having a clear assassin who was determined to specifically kill King Richard.  The historian John Gillingham has suggested there are reasons to doubt Roger\u2019s account of events, however. While Roger has generally been regarded as an impartial and reliable source, Gillingham draws a distinction between what Roger was writing in the 1170s and 1180s from his work in the 1190s. While in his younger years Roger had been intimately involved in Anglo-French politics, by the late 1190s he had retired to Howden in Yorkshire and seems to have primarily concerned himself with regional matters in and around northern England. As such, he probably is not a particularly informed source about events in central France during this period. So while we know Roger was writing very close to the event \u2013 he only outlived Richard by a few years \u2013 Gillingham suggests there is reason to interpret the Bertrannus de Gurdon story as myth."

            " There is almost certainly no single origin for the trope of the grim, mysterious, or downright evil wetland. It appears in cultures across the globe, in early texts as well as more recent media. Wetlands cover about a quarter of the Earth\u2019s land area, and there are many, many types\u2014peat bogs, salt marshes, mangrove swamps, floodplains\u2026 Given this impossible-to-cover scope, I\u2019m going to point to just a few factors that may play into the negative perception of such biomes, at least for some cultures, at least some of the time. Also I\u2019m interpreting the \u201cevil and foreboding\u201d of your question pretty widely, to encompass a spectrum of weird, supernatural, and frightening associations. \r    \r   I\u2019ll cover five broad categories of spookiness associated with wetlands: disease, predators, natural dangers, the concept of the liminal, and lawlessness. This isn\u2019t meant to be comprehensive, and there's undoubtedly more to be said. Also, as you\u2019ll see, aspects of each of these qualities inform and shade into one another. \r    \r   /u/lunes8 goes into this in more detail, so just briefly: the association between wetlands and disease isn\u2019t some relic of ancient superstition. Mosquitoes still kill about 700,000 people a year, far more than any other type of animal. As this map shows, more than half of the world\u2019s land was malarial prior to the twentieth century, and this half included nearly all regions that were historically densely populated. Cholera, typhoid, and other nasty diseases are likewise linked to water supply, and so to the landscapes from which people draw their water. In premodern Eurasia, the killing power of wetlands was associated with the \u201cmiasma,\u201d the fetid vapors of decay that rise from swamps. The ancient Greeks and Chinese alike attributed numerous fatal diseases to this fog, and the belief that miasma causes epidemics was prevalent into the 19th century before finally being replaced by germ theory.    \r    \r   Moving on to somewhat larger animals, wetlands are home to a number of dangerous beasts, including crocodilians, snakes, sharks and other predatory fish. The Sundarbans, the world\u2019s largest mangrove forest on the Bay of Bengal, contains a famously deadly population of tigers. Bears, boars, hippos, and other irascible megafauna also frequent these habitats, particularly at times of year when humans may also be more likely to enter them in search of resources like salmon or mast. Alongside\u2014and perhaps at least somewhat inspired by\u2014these biological creatures are the countless monsters said to dwell in swamps, marshes, lakes, and rivers: the Stymphalian birds and Hydra of Greek myth, the Australian bunyip, the mishipeshu or \u201cunderwater panther\u201d of indigenous North/Northeastern America, the nahang of the Iranian world (whose name means something like \u201cthe one who pulls its prey beneath the surface\u201d), and the Swamp Apes and Loch Ness Monsters of modern cryptozoology, to cite just a few. Some scary water dwellers, like Peg Powler of the Tees, may play \u201cnursery bogey\u201d roles, keeping children cautious around dangerous activities (like straying too close to deep water.) Others, like Grendel, are used to express complex anxieties about culture, history, and colonization. But in various forms, their stories are told worldwide, rooting a deep connection between wetlands and uncanny, often malevolent beings.  \r    \r   Probably equally important for the imagining of these monsters are the numerous natural dangers of wetland environments. Quicksand is probably the most cinematic. Drowning remains the leading non-congenital cause of death for children 1-4, and traditional balladry is full of woeful tales of drowned lovers. Simply getting lost in the wilds is incredibly dangerous, and shifting ground, mist, lack of landmarks, and thick vegetation can all make wetlands especially easy (and treacherous) places to get lost. The power of swamps to bewilder travelers is typified by will-o\u2019-the-wisps, glowing atmospheric phenomena (probably including flares of marsh gas as well as bioluminescent animals and plants) imagined as wicked spirits leading the unwary into the mire. \r    \r   The presence of supernatural beings is in turn linked to the perception of wetlands as liminal or transitional zones. They often occur at the junctures between different biomes, and around bodies of water which have often functioned as boundary markers for human societies. Wetland topography is regularly re-shaped by flooding and other forces, and constant transformation is also perceptible in the amphibious creatures that live in these areas. These and other associations have given an explicitly otherworldly cast to wetlands in numerous cultures. Many peoples associated with the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex along and east of the Mississippi River identify the wet, gloomy, and transformational aspects of swamps with the Lower World, a realm of chaos and death as well as wealth and fecundity. In Northwestern Europe, lakes and bogs are frequently depicted as passage points between the human world and otherworldly realms. Medieval texts like *Branwen ferch Ll\u0177r* and *Tydorel* describe the terrifying consequences of human interactions with the denizens of these underwater spaces. As with the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, there was a recognition that wetlands contained great wealth for those who dared to delve into them\u2014but that these rewards were often guarded by uncanny powers.

Border zones, difficult to map, dangerous to outsiders for all the reasons discussed above, very hard to pacify with roads and fortresses\u2014wetlands have long attracted those who seek to live outside (or on the margins of) states. People move to, or stay in, these zones for a variety of reasons: for example, holy solitude (like Saint Guthlac), banditry (as depicted in the great Chinese novel *Shuihu zhuan*, \u2018Water Margin\u2019 or \u2018Outlaws of the Marsh\u2019), freedom from taxation and conscription (as with the runaway serfs who contributed to the formation of Cossack communities along the Dnieper), or anticolonial resistance (the last native Prince of Wales, Dafydd ap Gruffydd, and the Wampanoag sachem Metacomet are only two of the many resistance leaders who made their last stands in swamps).

Note, though, that especially the last two factors can have a positive valence, depending on narratorial perspective.

These contest the discourse of wetlands as obstacles to human flourishing, and insist instead on their ecological, social, and political importance.",
            " This is a much bigger question than meets the eye.  The first point to note is that swamps and wetlands were vastly more common prior to the seventeenth century, and were always home to human communities for exactly the reasons you mentioned. Whether in waterlogged mountain valleys or in the vast marshes which stretched alongside the always-shifting rivers, people lived alongside and in wetlands for almost all of human history. James Scott has recently argued (somewhat provocatively) that wetlands were the real cradle of civilization, hosting settled communities many centuries before the first city-states coalesced \\[Scott, 2017\\]. And more specifically for Northern and Central Europe in Early-Modernity, the cold and wet climatic patterns of the Little Ice Age probably meant that living with water was a normal aspect of human life for the majority.   And while disease has already been noted here, wetlands could provide essential resources for survival. For example, when the uplands dried out in the early spring and late summer, livestock could reliably be put to pasture in wetlands and served as keystone species \\[Biro et al. 2019\\]. When agriculture failed due to disease, climate, or war, the wetland offered a reliably extreme diversity of food sources, not to mention refuge from landlords, tax collectors, and pillagers. Certainly African slaves and Native Americans found the dense wetlands of colonial America places of refuge and security, where they founded maroon communities. Perhaps as late as the 1850s in Hungary (the P\u00e1k\u00e1sz), 1991 in Iraq (the Marsh Arabs), and even today in the Danube Delta in Romania (the Lipoveni) communities continued to live in wetlands on mixed cultivation and hunter-gathering, sometimes using reeds to build their homes.  So the question of how swamps and wetlands became places of evil must be recognized as a discourse of modernity, and as a discourse of exclusion. When early modern European writers talk about the people who live in swamps, they invariably emphasize their backwardness, sickliness, and lack of industry. Malaria is a very good reason to not want to live in an early-Modern wetland, but this discourse is one specifically used to justify the drainage of wetland for intensive agriculture first by the aristocracy, and then later (in the mid to late eighteenth century) by the Absolutist state. As David Blackbourn observes, \"violence was the midwife of reclamation.\" Attempts to drain wetlands invariably met with local opposition, like the famous \"Fen Tigers\" who sabotaged the draining of seventeenth-century England. For this reason, land clearance became a military affair, and one of the key reasons for the founding of military engineering corps in the Habsburg Empire, Prussia, and to a lesser degree France and England. Even today, it's the US Army Corps of Engineers which is responsible for building and maintaining the massive dikes desperately trying to keep control over the Mississippi River. At the same time, the people who lived in and relied upon wetlands were always intentionally made invisible.  Back to your original question. I would say that while wetlands have always been avoided for their diseases by some, the negative idea of swamps as evil and foreboding was radically intensified in the nineteenth century, in narratives written about the landscape that existed before mass drainage works. Where the Hungarian bishop Nicolaus Olahus describes the marshes of the Banat region in the sixteenth-century as extremely rich in fish products, 300 years later the Hungarian revolutionary nobleman M\u00f3r J\u00f3kai describes the same region as being (in the previous century) a \"waste and roadless empire of marshes; a country of wolves, of frogs and turtles... covered both for people and beasts by a poising mist\" \\[Magina, 2015\\]. He gets even weirder, claiming that there were clouds of mosquitoes and gadflies so thick that they could kill cows, and so many \"serpents and other reptiles\u2019 armies\" that outside in the fields their heads rose like never yet seen plants.\" Thing is, Olahus described a landscape he could see around him, while J\u00f3kai was describing a world that was already long gone.  For reference, I'm hoping to start a project mapping biomass loss between the 1780s and 1820s in the Habsburg Empire using the first topographic maps. My back-of-the-napkin estimate is something like an 85% reduction in the wetland of the Tisza \\[Thei\u00df\\] river in southern Hungary due to canalization, way before environmental and climate data even began to be recorded.

        "sft_target": " There is almost certainly no single origin for the trope of the grim, mysterious, or downright evil wetland. It appears in cultures across the globe, in early texts as well as more recent media. Wetlands cover about a quarter of the Earth\u2019s land area, and there are many, many types\u2014peat bogs, salt marshes, mangrove swamps, floodplains\u2026 Given this impossible-to-cover scope, I\u2019m going to point to just a few factors that may play into the negative perception of such biomes, at least for some cultures, at least some of the time. Also I\u2019m interpreting the \u201cevil and foreboding\u201d of your question pretty widely, to encompass a spectrum of weird, supernatural, and frightening associations. \r    \r   I\u2019ll cover five broad categories of spookiness associated with wetlands: disease, predators, natural dangers, the concept of the liminal, and lawlessness. This isn\u2019t meant to be comprehensive, and there's undoubtedly more to be said. Also, as you\u2019ll see, aspects of each of these qualities inform and shade into one another. \r    \r   /u/lunes8 goes into this in more detail, so just briefly: the association between wetlands and disease isn\u2019t some relic of ancient superstition. Mosquitoes still kill about 700,000 people a year, far more than any other type of animal. As this map shows, more than half of the world\u2019s land was malarial prior to the twentieth century, and this half included nearly all regions that were historically densely populated. Cholera, typhoid, and other nasty diseases are likewise linked to water supply, and so to the landscapes from which people draw their water. In premodern Eurasia, the killing power of wetlands was associated with the \u201cmiasma,\u201d the fetid vapors of decay that rise from swamps. The ancient Greeks and Chinese alike attributed numerous fatal diseases to this fog, and the belief that miasma causes epidemics was prevalent into the 19th century before finally being replaced by germ theory.    \r    \r   Moving on to somewhat larger animals, wetlands are home to a number of dangerous beasts, including crocodilians, snakes, sharks and other predatory fish. The Sundarbans, the world\u2019s largest mangrove forest on the Bay of Bengal, contains a famously deadly population of tigers. Bears, boars, hippos, and other irascible megafauna also frequent these habitats, particularly at times of year when humans may also be more likely to enter them in search of resources like salmon or mast. Alongside\u2014and perhaps at least somewhat inspired by\u2014these biological creatures are the countless monsters said to dwell in swamps, marshes, lakes, and rivers: the Stymphalian birds and Hydra of Greek myth, the Australian bunyip, the mishipeshu or \u201cunderwater panther\u201d of indigenous North/Northeastern America, the nahang of the Iranian world (whose name means something like \u201cthe one who pulls its prey beneath the surface\u201d), and the Swamp Apes and Loch Ness Monsters of modern cryptozoology, to cite just a few. Some scary water dwellers, like Peg Powler of the Tees, may play \u201cnursery bogey\u201d roles, keeping children cautious around dangerous activities (like straying too close to deep water.) Others, like Grendel, are used to express complex anxieties about culture, history, and colonization. But in various forms, their stories are told worldwide, rooting a deep connection between wetlands and uncanny, often malevolent beings.  \r    \r   Probably equally important for the imagining of these monsters are the numerous natural dangers of wetland environments. Quicksand is probably the most cinematic. Drowning remains the leading non-congenital cause of death for children 1-4, and traditional balladry is full of woeful tales of drowned lovers. Simply getting lost in the wilds is incredibly dangerous, and shifting ground, mist, lack of landmarks, and thick vegetation can all make wetlands especially easy (and treacherous) places to get lost. The power of swamps to bewilder travelers is typified by will-o\u2019-the-wisps, glowing atmospheric phenomena (probably including flares of marsh gas as well as bioluminescent animals and plants) imagined as wicked spirits leading the unwary into the mire. \r    \r   The presence of supernatural beings is in turn linked to the perception of wetlands as liminal or transitional zones. They often occur at the junctures between different biomes, and around bodies of water which have often functioned as boundary markers for human societies. Wetland topography is regularly re-shaped by flooding and other forces, and constant transformation is also perceptible in the amphibious creatures that live in these areas. These and other associations have given an explicitly otherworldly cast to wetlands in numerous cultures. Many peoples associated with the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex along and east of the Mississippi River identify the wet, gloomy, and transformational aspects of swamps with the Lower World, a realm of chaos and death as well as wealth and fecundity. In Northwestern Europe, lakes and bogs are frequently depicted as passage points between the human world and otherworldly realms. Medieval texts like *Branwen ferch Ll\u0177r* and *Tydorel* describe the terrifying consequences of human interactions with the denizens of these underwater spaces. As with the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, there was a recognition that wetlands contained great wealth for those who dared to delve into them\u2014but that these rewards were often guarded by uncanny powers. There really was literal treasure in European wetlands\u2014many Bronze and Iron Age goods have been recovered from ritual deposit sites in pools, swamps, and marshes. The occasional association of such items with bog bodies, corpses eerily mummified in peat bogs, may have further contributed to the perception of wetlands as sites inhabited by bizarre and unsettling entities.  \r    \r   And of course, as /u/ThatHapsburgMapGuy says, wetlands have always been inhabited by human societies. While I disagree with their contention that the vilification of wetlands \u201cmust be recognized as a discourse of modernity\u201d--there are few more evil swamps in literature than Grendel and his mother\u2019s lair in Beowulf\u2014I fully agree that it is, also and often, \u201ca discourse of exclusion.\u201d Following their citation of James Scott, it\u2019s reasonable to say that wetlands are up there with mountains and deserts as biomes that have historically resisted systems of state control and legibility.

            " One should not see the sacking of Ctesiphon as decisive or proof of Roman superiority in strategic terms. The Parthians had mostly cavalry forces and simply declined battle. The power base of the Parthians was in Iran, not Mesopotamia. This was beyond then reach of Rome, and thus they could not deliver a knock out blow. When the Romans withdrew, the Parthian army was still intact and quickly recaptured the lost territory.  Now, in terms of tactics, the Roman army was a very differrent beast in the 2nd Century compared to 53 BC. The army of Crassus was mostly of heavy infantry with little cavalry or missile support. It was the lack of archers which really led to the defeat, in my opinion. By the 2nd century Rome made full use of auxilliaries like light and heavy cavalry, skirmishers and missle troops. The Roman state was also far better organized with superior logistics. The Parthians recognized it was better to wait out the Romans rather than fight a pitched battle.

The Parthians were a mostly mounted army and he basically allowed his forces to be lead into the most open terrain around. His poor decision making stacked the deck against him from the start.   Even with all this, his army wasn\u2019t even technically defeated in battle, the real damage was done after Crassus died in negotiations and the Romans had to turn tail and run home, being harried to death in the process. Before that they had suffered some major setbacks including the loss of most of their cavalry, but they were still a mostly intact army.   If a better man had lead the expedition, it might have gone very differently, but that\u2019s neither here nor there. Fully mounted army\u2019s would be something the Romans (and everyone else) would have trouble dealing with for a very long time after this period.",
            " Related question: I\u2019ve read Crassus sent his main cavalry far ahead of the formation which allowed them to be ambushed and defeated, leaving the army mostly without cavalry. Is this true? And had he not done this would the battle have gone the way it did?"
        ],
        "sft_target": " One should not see the sacking of Ctesiphon as decisive or proof of Roman superiority in strategic terms. The Parthians had mostly cavalry forces and simply declined battle. The power base of the Parthians was in Iran, not Mesopotamia. This was beyond then reach of Rome, and thus they could not deliver a knock out blow. When the Romans withdrew, the Parthian army was still intact and quickly recaptured the lost territory.  Now, in terms of tactics, the Roman army was a very differrent beast in the 2nd Century compared to 53 BC. The army of Crassus was mostly of heavy infantry with little cavalry or missile support. It was the lack of archers which really led to the defeat, in my opinion. By the 2nd century Rome made full use of auxilliaries like light and heavy cavalry, skirmishers and missle troops. The Roman state was also far better organized with superior logistics. The Parthians recognized it was better to wait out the Romans rather than fight a pitched battle.

    "\n\nHuman: Just finished watching \"12 Years a Slave\": Was life for slaves in the southern U.S. during the 1800's really as bad as these movies depict? What was the average life like for an average slave on an average plantation? Believe me, not trying to undermine the abhorrence of slavery but these plantations in these slavery movies (Django, 12 Years...etc.) are always depicted so horribly, where the slave masters are literally the second coming of Hitler/Satan. I wonder if this done for effect because these are movies. I find it a bit hard to believe the average slave owner was so cruel, I can see being raised to think slaves are your property, just as you might oxen or horses, but people don't beat their horses to within one inch of their life. Because most people are just not that evil/sadistic and why do that to your property? Better to treat your property well and take care of it so it is a well performing asset. But maybe it really was so bad. Anyone have any idea?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " There was no average life for an average slave on an average plantation -- that's one of the reasons I really enjoyed the film *12 Years a Slave*. It shows the multiple ways that slaves existed, and the numerous strategies that slave owners adopted. One strategy was essentially a paternalist approach, epitomized in the film by Benedict Cumberbatch's character. The idea is that the slave owner won't face as much resistance from slaves if he treats them with some measure of decency, and develops a bond of some kind between slave and master. In case you're interested, this way of mediating between master and slave was famously charted by Eugene Genovese in his book *Roll, Jordan, Roll*.   The other major strategy was to inspire terror. I think that you err in assuming that these slave owners' infliction of violence on their slaves was irrational. Your comparison between them and \"Hitler/Satan\" and your example of people not beating their horses suggests this, at least to me. Rather, slave owners' violence was often quite calculated and strategic. As someone else noted in this thread, slaves were much smarter than horses. They saw that they could be beaten or killed for any act of defiance. In the antebellum South, many slave owners maintained a constant atmosphere of violence and fear, in order to keep slaves under control. Slave owners were not simply cruel for no reason. Admittedly, in the film, Epps seemed to be motivated by simple malice. Fassbender's portrayal didn't allow for much nuance. However, slave owners would have known precisely why they were attacking or beating their slaves.   A final point I'll make tonight is that if we look beyond the antebellum South, prior to the abolition of the slave trade, it was not uncommon for slave owners to beat or work their \"property\" to death, knowing that they could cheaply replace them. Admittedly, this changed to an extent after the slave trade was abolished, but I would argue that the logic was not really that much different in the mid-nineteenth century United States. Slaves were replaceable, and a slave that resisted his/her master's tyranny in any way might seem to be more trouble than he or she was worth. This logic certainly holds for other kinds of property - horses, in your example.",

            " Note: strictly speaking this is not an answer to this question, it is more of a meta-answer, but it provides some points which I think are important so I'm posting it regardless.  First off, realize that it is fundamentally impossible to truly understand the nature of slavery (anywhere) through any narrative, no matter how intimate. The fact is that without spending years and years of your life as a slave, without having the sure certain knowledge that you will live all the rest of your years and die as the property of another man burned into your consciousness you can only possibly understand the rudimentary outlines of slavery.  Second, the truth does not solve this problem. The truth is, was, that the day to day life of many slaves wasn't all that bad. In fact, compared to the average experience of the average \"free\" citizen of North America through the mid 19th century it really wasn't so bad at all, and some slaves lived lives that might seem preferable compared to many non-slaves in America, even up through, say, 1850. If you were an alien from a remote stellar system who had no knowledge of the history of slavery and through some high-tech device you were able to watch, say, an entire week's worth of footage of some random subset of American slaves circa 1850 you might not think it was such a bad deal.  But such conclusions would be erroneous, and hugely so. The problem here is that humans are great at coping, it's one of our most powerful features, and statistics can lead you to incorrect conclusions because outlier events can be so important that they define the nature of a thing. As a hypothetical, imagine a father who rapes his pre-teen daughter every year on her birthday. Statistically that incest/rape is an outlier, but that event is so important that the fact that it happens at all, let alone repeatedly, makes a huge qualitative and categorical difference.  And that's the situation with oppression in general and slavery in particular. If the master only whips one of many slaves on a plantation once over a period of a decade the fact that such a thing ever happened and that it's possible for such a thing to happen utterly characterizes the master/slave relationship. You can look into someone's eyes, you can talk with them, you can spend hours and hours with them, you can think you know them but there is a good chance that you may never learn that for them every waking moment they are living in fear. There are thousands of abused spouses in this county who are living in fear and hiding their fear from even their closest friends. Imagine what it must have been like to live as a slave in 19th century America. To know the degree to which it is codified in the informal and formal rules of society and in the laws of the land that you are less. That any white man can say anything he wants to you or order you around. That your master controls your fate not you. That your master could force you to marry whoever he chose. That your master could sell your children or your wife and you could do nothing about it. That your master could rape your wife or your daughter and you could do nothing to stop it. Less. Powerless. Worthless. Hopeless.  Could you imagine how that would affect your thinking, your personality, your capacity for happiness every single waking moment of your life? And imagine how it must feel to build up little mental rationalizations in your mind, to think that your master isn't so bad, that he doesn't seem likely to ever rape you or your friends or loved ones, or sell you or them off to some other plantation. And then one day something happens that's just slightly out of character for your master, maybe he gets angry and is verbally abusive when he's never been before, who knows. Or maybe he just takes ill for a little while and you're faced thinking about what will happen if you're forced to work for another master. Suddenly your little house of rationalizations is in doubt, suddenly there is nothing that you can depend on in your life. Suddenly the possibility of being whipped repeatedly, casually executed for sport, raped or see your loved ones raped, all of that becomes a lingering possibility at the back of your mind.  That's the true horror of slavery. And it's that sort of thing that is impossible to get across without dressing up slavery in \"stage makeup\" and focusing on abuses more than ordinary daily life, because those events are by and large more relevant.  Abuses were not universally the norm, they were often the exception. But the fact that they did still happen and the fact that they could happen at any time is what characterized slavery in that setting and time period. As I said, there is absolutely no way to get across the entirety of the experience of slavery through the medium of film, television, or literature, so then it becomes necessary to provide a sketch, an impression of the nature of slavery. And any such sketch which does not include abuses as a fundamental aspect of the nature of slavery in America is one that is irredeemably flawed.",

            " What drugs were popular in 19th century Britain?",
            " Great question! I'll refer you to *Emperors of Dreams: Drugs in the Nineteenth Century* by Mike Jay, and I'll mix in a few other sources as we talk about it. David Musto (the god of American narcotics historians) wrote a fascinating 1989 paper entitled \"Why did Sherlock Holmes Use Cocaine?\" that I recommend too.  Before we talk about Arthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes, let's pull back a little bit and talk about late Victorian British society's attitude toward narcotics. Narcotics \u2500 particularly opium and morphine, but also cocaine and other substances \u2500 were a hot-button topic in Victorian Britain and the United States at the time.  As Jay points out, a lot of the discussion on opium portrays it almost as a plague with significant racial undertones, given that most British and American audiences were introduced to opium by Chinese immigrants or a Chinese experience. That's remarkably ironic given the role the British played in spreading opium in China. In Britain, the Anglo-Oriental Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade circulated a journal called *Friend of China* that ostensibly tried to point out all the harm opium had done to China.  In reality, it was a spectacularly racist publication that frequently claimed that the Chinese were piteous children unable to protect themselves against the opium menace, and only Western society could save them. Moreover, the journal warned, the opium menace might spread to Western society, with Biblical allusions to Hosea 8:7 (sowing the wind and reaping the whirlwind).  You see an anti-opium mood spread rapidly into popular culture in the late 1860s and into the 1870s. Dickens' unfinished novel, *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*, for example, features an opium addict and scenes in an opium den. The notion of the opium den as a plague, as something to be feared because it might infect polite society, begins to come to pass at this time. Conan Doyle takes it up, as does Oscar Wilde in *Picture of Dorian Gray.*  Meredith Conti, in a paper published last year in the book *Victorian Medicine and Popular Culture*, wonderfully explains that chronic drug use combined with this infectious, xenophobic viewpoint, and hit popular culture with a splash.  >\"Soon, however, a number of factors gradually reshaped public attitudes toward drug addiction: the return of wounded soldiers addicted to analgesics; physician over-prescription; the surge in opiate-laced patent medicines ... the invention of the hypodermic needle; and the first legislative restrictions on non-medical opiate use.\"  In popular society, there had been a belief during the middle part of the century that addicts had nothing to blame but themselves. It was because of their weak will, or poor morals, or some personal factor that made them vulnerable to opium, alcohol and vice. As Darwin's theories became more popular, the idea came about that there must be a genetic cause \u2500 that addicts have a hereditary inclination toward addiction.    Note that there is at this time a big difference between *addiction* and *use.* This distinction would persist until the early 20th century, by and large. You'll frequently run into references to the idea that high-performing individuals, fast thinkers, big-doers, need to use narcotics to moderate their overheating minds, otherwise they might suffer a breakdown. You see this in *The Sign of Four,* where Conan Doyle writes about Holmes needing to stave off boredom.  Elsewhere, there's often a feminine tone to this language, as the thoughts of the period were that the feminine spirit was fragile and needed to be kept in balance or otherwise preserved from too much emotion.  The idea of a \"naturally corrupt\" class of people prone to addiction starts to change in the late 1870s and early 1880s. In 1876, Edward Levinstein published the influential *Morbid Craving for Morphia*, which described narcotics' *corrupting* influence, about how even proper people could be brought low. In the years after his work, drug addiction became a medical condition in Britain.  At the same time, cocaine begins to come onto the British scene in a big way. In 1885, for example, Doyle's hometown of Southsea hosts the British Dental Association's annual conference. The conference's big topic? The virtues of cocaine anaesthesia. This was also the time when Americans, British citizens and others in Western society were flocking to coca-laced beverages (*Coca-Cola,* anyone?) as the new fad.   In a 1994 paper, \"Sherlock Holmes, Conan Doyle and cocaine,\" D.N. Pearce suggests that Doyle's studies at the University of Edinburgh, where toxicology research was quite advanced for the time, gave him a leg up in anticipating the harmful effects of cocaine.  By the time *The Sign of the Four* is published five years later, with its remarkable references to cocaine addiction, the popular mood had begun to shift in the direction of cocaine as a vice rather than a pure medicine. The Sherlock Holmes stories aren't the only place you see this discussion come up. Think of *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, published in 1886, and other stories, such as those by Bloomsbury and M.P. Shiel.  Jay suggests that Conan Doyle intended Holmes' cocaine habit to be part of his bohemian, counterculture identity, but as popular opinion began viewing cocaine as purely a vice, references fade to holmes' use. By 1904, when *The Missing Three-Quarter* is published, Conan Doyle writes that his hero has been \"weaned\" from his \"drug mania\" which had \"threatened to check his remarkable career,\" something that's clearly a ret-con to accommodate changing times.  As Musto wrote in his 1989 paper, \"Therefore, Holmes's use of cocaine was not reprehensible. Leading physicians much more prominent than the wise Dr. Watson recommended cocaine for the reasons Holmes used it. That he used cocaine was unfortunate, but he corrected the error \u2500 and that was commendable.\""

Dickens' unfinished novel, *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*, for example, features an opium addict and scenes in an opium den. The notion of the opium den as a plague, as something to be feared because it might infect polite society, begins to come to pass at this time. Conan Doyle takes it up, as does Oscar Wilde in *Picture of Dorian Gray.*  Meredith Conti, in a paper published last year in the book *Victorian Medicine and Popular Culture*, wonderfully explains that chronic drug use combined with this infectious, xenophobic viewpoint, and hit popular culture with a splash.  >\"Soon, however, a number of factors gradually reshaped public attitudes toward drug addiction: the return of wounded soldiers addicted to analgesics; physician over-prescription; the surge in opiate-laced patent medicines ... the invention of the hypodermic needle; and the first legislative restrictions on non-medical opiate use.\"  In popular society, there had been a belief during the middle part of the century that addicts had nothing to blame but themselves. It was because of their weak will, or poor morals, or some personal factor that made them vulnerable to opium, alcohol and vice. As Darwin's theories became more popular, the idea came about that there must be a genetic cause \u2500 that addicts have a hereditary inclination toward addiction.    Note that there is at this time a big difference between *addiction* and *use.* This distinction would persist until the early 20th century, by and large. You'll frequently run into references to the idea that high-performing individuals, fast thinkers, big-doers, need to use narcotics to moderate their overheating minds, otherwise they might suffer a breakdown. You see this in *The Sign of Four,* where Conan Doyle writes about Holmes needing to stave off boredom.  Elsewhere, there's often a feminine tone to this language, as the thoughts of the period were that the feminine spirit was fragile and needed to be kept in balance or otherwise preserved from too much emotion.  The idea of a \"naturally corrupt\" class of people prone to addiction starts to change in the late 1870s and early 1880s. In 1876, Edward Levinstein published the influential *Morbid Craving for Morphia*, which described narcotics' *corrupting* influence, about how even proper people could be brought low. In the years after his work, drug addiction became a medical condition in Britain.  At the same time, cocaine begins to come onto the British scene in a big way. In 1885, for example, Doyle's hometown of Southsea hosts the British Dental Association's annual conference. The conference's big topic? The virtues of cocaine anaesthesia. This was also the time when Americans, British citizens and others in Western society were flocking to coca-laced beverages (*Coca-Cola,* anyone?) as the new fad.   In a 1994 paper, \"Sherlock Holmes, Conan Doyle and cocaine,\" D.N. Pearce suggests that Doyle's studies at the University of Edinburgh, where toxicology research was quite advanced for the time, gave him a leg up in anticipating the harmful effects of cocaine.  By the time *The Sign of the Four* is published five years later, with its remarkable references to cocaine addiction, the popular mood had begun to shift in the direction of cocaine as a vice rather than a pure medicine. The Sherlock Holmes stories aren't the only place you see this discussion come up. Think of *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, published in 1886, and other stories, such as those by Bloomsbury and M.P. Shiel.  Jay suggests that Conan Doyle intended Holmes' cocaine habit to be part of his bohemian, counterculture identity, but as popular opinion began viewing cocaine as purely a vice, references fade to holmes' use. By 1904, when *The Missing Three-Quarter* is published, Conan Doyle writes that his hero has been \"weaned\" from his \"drug mania\" which had \"threatened to check his remarkable career,\" something that's clearly a ret-con to accommodate changing times.  As Musto wrote in his 1989 paper, \"Therefore, Holmes's use of cocaine was not reprehensible. Leading physicians much more prominent than the wise Dr. Watson recommended cocaine for the reasons Holmes used it. That he used cocaine was unfortunate, but he corrected the error \u2500 and that was commendable.\"",

    "\n\nHuman: Do You Read and Know Things? Become a Flair and Put It to Use! \u2022 The /r/AskHistorians Flair Application Thread XXIV Welcome flair applicants! This is the place to apply for a flair \u2013 the colored text you will have seen next to some user's names indicating their specialization. We are always looking for new flaired users, and if you think you have what it takes to join the panel of historians, you're in the right place!  For examples of previous applications, and our current panel of historians, you can find the previous application thread here, and there is a list of active flaired users](/r/AskHistorians/wiki/flairedusers) on our wiki.  **[Requirements for a flair**  A flair in /r/AskHistorians indicates extensive, in-depth knowledge about an area of history *and* a proven track record of providing great answers in the subreddit. In applying for a flair, you are claiming to have:  * **Expertise in an area of history**, typically from either degree-level academic experience or an equivalent amount of self-study. For more exploration of this, check out this thread.  * The ability to **cite sources** from specialist literature for any claims you make within your area.  * The ability to provide **high quality answers** in the subreddit in accordance with our rules.    For a more in-depth look at how applications are analyzed, consult this helpful guide on our wiki explaining what an answer that demonstrates the above looks like.  **How to apply**  To apply for a flair, simply post in this thread. Your post needs to include:  * Links to **3 to 5 answers** which show a sustained involvement in the community, including at least one within the past month.    * These answers should **all relate to the topic area in which you are seeking flair**. They should demonstrate your claim to **knowledge and expertise** on that topic, as well as your ability to write about that topic **comprehensively and in-depth**. Outside credentials or works can provide secondary support, *but cannot replace these requirements*.  * The **text of your flair** and which category it belongs in (see the sidebar). Be as specific as possible as we prefer flair to reflect the exact area of your expertise as near as possible, but be aware there is a limit of 64 characters.  * If you are a former, now inactive flair, an application with **one** recent flair-quality answer, plus additional evidence of renewed community involvement, is required.  One of the moderators will then either confirm your flair or, if the application doesn't adequately show you meet the requirements, explain what's missing. If you get rejected, don't despair! We're happy to give you advice and pointers on how to improve your portfolio for a future application. Plenty of panelists weren't approved the first time.  If there's a backlog this may take a few days but we will try to get around to everyone as quickly as possible.  **Updated Procedures**  Note that we have made some slight changes to the requirements of the past. Previous applications required all answers to be within the past six months. But we realize that this can sometimes be tough if you write about uncommon topics. We have changed the temporal requirement to be *one* answer that was written in the past month. The answers as a whole will be evaluated holistically with an eye towards a regular pace of contributions. i.e. 3 answers each spaced 3 months apart would be accepted now, but we would likely ask for more recent contributions if an application was one recent answer and the rest over a year old. Flair reflects not only expertise, but involvement in the AskHistorians community.  **\"I'm an Expert About Something But Never Have a Chance to Write About It!\"**  Some topics only come up once in a blue moon, but that doesn't mean you can't still get flair in it! There are a number of avenues to follow, many of which are dealt with in greater detail at the last section of this thread.  **Expected Behavior**  We invest a large amount of trust in the flaired members of /r/askhistorians, as they represent the subreddit when answering questions, participating in AMAs, and even in their participation across reddit as a whole. As such, we do take into account an applicant's user history reddit-wide when reviewing an application, and will reject applicants whose post history demonstrate bigotry, racism, or sexism. Such behavior is not tolerated in /r/askhistorians, and we do not tolerate it from our panelists in any capacity. We additionally reserve the right to revoke flair based on evidence of such behavior after the application process has been completed. /r/AskHistorians is a safe space for everyone, and those attitudes have no place here.  **Quality Contributors**  If you see an unflaired user consistently giving excellent answers, they can be nominated for a \"Quality Contributor\" flair. Just message the mods their username and some example comments which you believe meet the above criteria.  **FAQ Finder**   To apply for FAQ finder, we require demonstration of a consistent history of community involvement and linking to previous responses and the FAQ. We expect to see potential FAQ Finders be discerning in what they link to, ensuring that it is to threads which represent the current standards of the subreddit, and they do so in a polite and courteous manner, both to the 'Asker', and also by including a username ping of the original 'Answerer'.  **Revoking Flair**  Having a flair brings with it a greater expectation to abide by the subreddit's rules and maintain the high standard of discussion we all like to see here. The mods will revoke the flair of anybody who continually breaks the rules, fails to meet the standard for answers in their area of expertise, or violates the above mentioned expectations. Happily, we almost never have to do this.  **Additional Resources**  Before applying for flair, we encourage you to check out these resources to help you with the application process:  * Our Rules Roundtable on what a 'Good Answer' looks like * Our Wiki Guide on what makes a good application * The Previous Application Threads, to see what makes for successful - and not successful - applications.  * The Sunday Digest, and Monthly Awards which can provide many examples of we are looking for regarding the caliber of flaired users.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: PA] EEOC Says Work-from-Home Not Guaranteed as Post-Pandemic Reasonable Accommodation **EEOC Says Work-from-Home Not Guaranteed as Post-Pandemic Reasonable Accommodation**  Sept. 10, 2020 By: Mark Blondman, Blank Rome LLP  During the pandemic, many employers have permitted employees to work remotely/telework in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. As the incidence of the virus has subsided in certain geographic areas, employers have begun to reopen their worksites and have required employees to return to their physical place of work. In doing so, these employers have been met with requests from certain employees that they be permitted to continue working remotely, leading to the question of whether the employer is required to grant such a request. In Technical Assistance Questions and Answers issued on September 8, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) answered the question with a qualified \u201cNO.\u201d  Physical presence at the work site is considered an \u201cessential function\u201d of many jobs, which, in some cases, was excused by employers during the pandemic. The EEOC\u2019s Technical Assistance document states clearly that even if  an employer is permitting telework to employees because of COVID-19 and is choosing to excuse an employee from performing one or more essential functions, then a request\u2014after the workplace reopens\u2014to continue telework as a reasonable accommodation does not have to be granted if it requires continuing to excuse the employee from performing an essential function. The ADA [(Americans with Disabilities Act)] never requires an employer to eliminate an essential function as an accommodation for an individual with a disability.  According to the EEOC, the temporary suspension of performance of an essential function of the job during the pandemic \u201cdoes not mean that the employer permanently changed a job\u2019s essential functions, that telework is always a feasible accommodation, or that it does not pose an undue hardship.\u201d  While it appears clear that employers are permitted to reinstitute the requirement that employees return to the worksite, the EEOC\u2019s Technical Assistance does not suggest that all requests for continued telework can be summarily denied. Not surprisingly, the EEOC states that, while an employer is not restrained from restoring all of the employee\u2019s essential functions when it restores a prior work arrangement, it must still \u201cevaluat[e] any requests for continued or new accommodations [including telework] under the usual ADA rules.\u201d The text of the EEOC\u2019s Technical Assistance relating to continued teleworking can be read at section D.15 in the \u201cReasonable Accommodation\u201d section of [What You Should Know About COVID-19 and the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and Other EEO Laws.  We are not surprised that the EEOC has taken this position on continued teleworking. Employers can expect employees to return to the worksite upon request but must engage in the \u201cinteractive process\u201d when faced with a disability-related request for an accommodation and must be prepared to articulate a business rationale for making physical presence at work an \u201dessential function,\u201d especially when the employee was permitted to work remotely during the pandemic.

    "\n\nHuman: [PA] What do I do about sexist and harassing comments in an interview process? So a little background, I\u2019m a (youngish) female engineer working predominantly in oil and gas. I\u2019m used to being treated awkwardly or inappropriately at times and for the most part I just roll my eyes. 99% of the time I\u2019m treated respectfully and kindly.   Recently I got an offer to be a subcontractor with one of the biggest (might be the biggest??) engineering/construction projects in the US and it\u2019s a very exciting opportunity. Unfortunately, the project manager (of the other company that is subcontracting me) decided to make comments about me during the meeting to accept terms.   Big no-no\u2019s were; 1. Saying that I was a very attractive woman 2. Asking if I was planning on getting pregnant 3. Asking if I was currently pregnant   When he paused for me to answer I simply responded with \u201cI don\u2019t think you can ask me that.\u201d  After the call, my boss told me that is the worst thing he\u2019d heard in 25 years and we discussed how uncomfortable the meeting was. A few hours later at the end of the day I went and talked to him about it again and requested we get the events documented. I\u2019m going to be working closely with this PM and I really don\u2019t want to escalate things at the moment and feel uncomfortable on site...but at the same time I don\u2019t think that behavior should be ignored either. My manager agreed and said he had already forwarded what had happened to the executives at my company to discuss on Monday.   I am pretty laid back and really don\u2019t want to make a stink about it, but it was very uncomfortable. Are there any other actions I should take besides documenting it?

            " I had a similar discussion with my boss, in late autumn last year the whole team went remote, and we had to install a time and \"productivity app\" on our computers.  I enjoyed working at a fast pace so that I finish things quicker so that I gain idle time at work. But from home in the application this behavior seemed like time theft, because out of 8hrs of work only 4/5.5 have been registered as work (the app tracks the mouse clicks.)  And then the boss called about time theft.   I was upset, because they only cared about how things looked on the app, and asked for 7+ hours of registered productivity in the app.  I started to work slower to fill in the time, and have  7hrs a day of \"productivity\".  From my perspective I am less productive, but hey it looks good on the tracking app and I also get to watch all the Netflix shows I want.  Maybe the employees does high intensity work, and needs longer periods of idle time to cope with it.",

    "\n\nHuman: [CA] Forced to clock out in order to use the restroom. **Background:** I do have a couple of mild disabilities such as being in the spectrum, and physical malformations (ankles and face). I have only partial use of my legs. Because of the aforementioned, I have struggled to get gainful employment, and since about a decade or so, I settled for call center work. Since I can work in a sedentary environment, I am not able to get disability long term, and also  enjoy having a purpose and being productive.  **Now**: I have been WFH for an extremely busy and understaffed call center, I am bilingual, so I save my employer lots of time and money by not needing to call the language line for an interpreter, I also learned how to handle all queues. I do not get differential pay for this, nor when I get sent to cover swing or night shifts because of \"business needs\".  Right now we answer nonstop high-stress calls with not even a second to breathe, takes notes, drink water or medication. We are monitored (micromanaged) on the phone, the computer, webcam for face video, and a second cam with side view of our torso/desk.   My direct supervisors have been refusing me restroom breaks lately, meaning that if I need to use the restroom I am forced to clock out for break or lunch, regardless of the time. Sometimes they just ignore me, or just say that we are too busy, or that they are not enough bilingual agents and will have to continue working regardless. They do not treat all agents like that, and I'm aware that it's a tricky situation to address. I would like advice/input, as well as some pointers or information about CA labor law regarding bathroom breaks.  I have tried contacting management to address this, to no avail.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Not in HR and not in CA. I don't think this is a HR issue, nor do you need to talk to this person to get them to do more work.   A response of \"Apologies, I do not have the capacity to do this. Please take this forward on your own given that it's a straightforward task\" should be sufficient to push back on work that the others forward on to you and expect you to handle on their behalf.  You don't have to provide justification to your co-workers on why you should do their work for them, only to your supervisor/manager. I would expect the senior most person to be able to put their foot down and ensure that the rest are trained to do everything that you can do. Spend the time to train, but let them make mistakes on their own and be on hand to guide them.  If there's no supervisor/manager, then this is an opportunity to position yourself as such and manage the team.  I presume that there must be some metric of measure to prove that you are putting in longer hours and dealing with higher volume of work as well for you to concretely say that you're doing more compared to the others.  If you're faced with justifications of you being paid more, there are many approaches to handle them diplomatically, some examples are:  - You are being paid more to handle higher \"value\" work. This can come across as condescending, but true as you're paid for your experience and doing simple tasks that the rest of them can handle does not free up your time to focus on these areas  - You are giving the rest of them opportunities to up skill and gain their own experience (and therefore more money). If they're not interested, then the use of metrics will be useful later.  - If they raise a stink about you not taking on their work, you can then do a direct exchange (i.e. just assign them something back in exchange for doing their work for them), preferably something that's complicated and will take a significant portion of time. If they refuse, then the lack of capacity on your part will be your justification. Make sure this communication is on email.  - Further refusal on their part can then be escalated to your supervisor/manager, asking them to step in and decide if you should drop everything to do your co-worker's task for them, and raise concerns about them passing on simple tasks to you to handle.  Do the above often enough and they hopefully will get the message and stop trying to foist work to you.  On the use of metrics:  - Metrics is the biggest proof of a person's workload. Publishing these metrics is also a transparent way to see who's doing more compared to the rest, and who is lagging behind/taking advantage of the rest. This is obvious on its own without you having to do anything (management does notice when someone is doing much less work than everyone else)  - Metrics can also be used in salary/bonus conversations. If you're doing 2 people's worth of work, then it's clear why the others shouldn't get more salary increment/bonuses but can also raise issues that you're not doing your part to train the others and there's risk in the knowledge being siloed.  You can also raise complaints to your managers that your co-worker is not pulling their weight and your metrics can be used as a form of measurement.",

    "\n\nHuman: I\u2019m being targeted by workplace bullies. I finally said something to management today and I feel stupid [MI] I\u2019m a 30 y/o woman living in [MI] and in my 11 years of working I have never had a group of people dislike me so deeply. My managers and upper managers like me. I am on of the top sales performers as well.   I\u2019ll try to make this long story short.   Last Sunday after I finished with a client a member of my team who we will call Sabrina started going around to all of my other teammates whispering something to them. I started to feel uncomfortable because I really felt like she was gossiping about me and I am not a confrontational person. I called my manager and let him know I wasn\u2019t feeling well so I left.  Yesterday I worked with Sabrina, she didn\u2019t speak to me but I was busy with appointments throughout my day anyway so I didn\u2019t interact with many coworkers.  Today I come into work and Sabrina was standing in a circle what looked to me like gossiping. Someone walked into the store I work at and I know him personally from outside of work so I said hi to him. Sabrina went up to him and asked if he needed help. Shortly after i asked him how he has been and how long he would be in town for. I let him know he has my number if he needs anything.  I walked away and Sabrina said didn\u2019t you just see me greet him? I said yeah I know but I personally know him. Another coworker who seemed to have been gossiping said \u201cyou say that every time it\u2019s disgusting.\u201d The other two coworkers she was standing around refuse to talk to me ever since Sunday. Nobody ever told me what I did wrong. I\u2019m assuming I sold a lot and left early so they were annoyed by that. However I did leave because the gossiping was making me so anxious I couldn\u2019t work.   Sabrina kept throwing jabs at me throughout the day. At the end of the day I had a client come in, he had an exchange. He was in the fitting room trying it on and came out to show his friends and ask for their opinion. Sabrina was standing next to me the whole time because she was helping the friends. I don\u2019t believe she realized that this client was doing an exchange that I had originally sold him. So when I told him it looks nice and he should get that one she muttered \u201cyou\u2019re going to learn today\u201d.  I walked away and called my supervisor and let him know of everything that was going on. He had witnessed her complaining about me earlier. I told him what has been happening with the team and how she\u2019s behaving. I have never gone to management over a coworker.   TLDR; Sabrina used to be a work friend, we\u2019re both the same age and attractive women. I relate more to the customers I think and clients do seem to gravitate toward me. Where she kind of walks around, stares in the mirrors and talks to associates all day.   Two weeks ago she screamed at me for trying to \u201ctake her customer\u201d (he wasn\u2019t being helped and was walking around trying to find anyone to assist him) she pointed her finger in my face and wouldn\u2019t stop yelling. I had to tell her to leave me alone 3 times.   She apologized the day after, I accepted and said please don\u2019t talk to me like that again.   Why is she behaving like this? Half of my team seems to hate me now but nobody has said why! I asked another coworker who is always very neutral and he said \u201cI know they\u2019ve been talking about you, it makes me uncomfortable and I stay out of that and I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s happening to you, I really don\u2019t understand why.\u201d  I let the management team know what is going on because I don\u2019t get involved in drama, I\u2019m easy to talk to as well. My manager sent me the Human Resources hotline and told me to call them to keep everything documented.   I just wish I knew why they are ganging up on me and I need to know how to move forward. Any advice would be so helpful.  *any said names have been changed for privacy concerns\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: I was hit on by the much-older coworker who is training me at my new job. Is speaking to HR an overreaction? [CA] I'm torn over whether or not I'm overreacting to an incident with a coworker, and whether going to HR is the right decision.  Backstory: I started at a company a little while ago, and LOVE my new job. My tasks often require me to be alone with my supervisor or the coworker who is training me (in areas like storage rooms, empty offices, etc.). I'm significantly younger (25) and physically smaller than them, and the only woman, but I've never felt uncomfortable\u2014 until this week.  **The other day, I asked the coworker who is training me (mid-fifties, married with kids) an innocuous question about a work procedure. The moment the only other person present left the (enclosed, windowless) room, he straight-up interrupted me and said, \"Just between you and me...and  I hope you don't take this offensively, but... I think you're** ***hot***.\"  Past experience has made me scared of angering men who hit on me, so I just said \"thank you\", made a joke (I don't see myself as attractive, but I didn't want to encourage more compliments by saying it), and laughed it off. **He seemed to think I was happy he told me and made jokes about how happy I must be that he \"finally said it\" (?????).** After half an hour of pretending to go through emails while I had tremendous anxiety, I went to lunch and cried.  I've started wearing baggy cardigans over my work shirts to hide my body a little more, and timing certain tasks for when he's present so I can have a moment of peace. I find myself not volunteering for things as much in case he offers to join me. When he wants to show me something, I find myself trying to get it over with as soon as possible so we're no longer alone. **I'm just unbearably anxious and uncomfortable.**  **My job depends on his training and his feedback to our boss and I'm worried that if I tell him off, it'll not only make the workplace** ***more*** **uncomfortable, but also inspire him to retaliate by telling our boss I didn't do things adequately, etc.**  I've made an appointment to speak with someone from HR, but now that the appointment is made, I'm doubting myself. I'm not asking for action to be taken, but I want a record in case another incident like this occurs. **Am I overreacting by going to HR, or is this something an HR rep would want an employee to speak to them about?**\n\nAssistant:": {

            " When I was 19(F) I went into work early one wednesday so I could leave early because I had a doctors appointment later that day. My boss (42M) arrived shortly after me which was unusual and we were the only 2 in office for about an hour. He came up behind me while I was at my desk. I could feel him behind me and when I went to turn to ask what he was doing, he grabbed me hard by my braid and yanked my head back against him and said \u201cdon\u2019t you know braids like this are every man\u2019s fantasy?\u201d with a creepy fucking look on his face. I yelled for him to let go and ran to the bathroom where I locked myself in until the rest of the staff came in. I told EVERYONE I worked next too and reported it to his manager who told me he would handle it and apologized. Later that day my boss stopped me before lunch with a fellow male coworker. He insisted I tell this other coworker it was just a joke and I wasn\u2019t going to tell anyone else. They both laughed and said it was harmless. I stood my ground and said it was sexual harassment. The next day, my boss\u2019s manager held a meeting with the two of us and I was fired.   2 months later the company called to offer me my job back and apologize. Turns out he was being inappropriate with several women and he failed a UA, testing positive for meth. They must have thought I might file a suit against them or something but I didn\u2019t accept the offer and I laughed that they even tried in the first place.   I\u2019m 29 now and have so much more confidence and little tolerance for anything unwarranted. I\u2019ve educated myself more on workplace employee rights. I would definitely report this. This is a protected category for workplace harassment. If he retaliated against you, you can file a lawsuit. Most lawyers take these cases on with no payment upfront because they\u2019re open and shut cases in favor of the victim.",

It will help you be more sure in your response because this will happen again at some point.  For example, imo asking if someone would be \"up for grabbing drinks after work sometime\" would be fine in my book... but commenting at all on someone's appearance, other than \"is that a new wristwatch?\" is a no go in a work setting. Especially for men. Sadly, it is a double standard, but it has to be as women are more vulnerable at work.  If you reflect on if it were a female who said it slightly differently, I think you might feel differently. And that's okay. You should know that, also the guy who said it does know that. And he said it anyway.  So consider that while we want to be proggressive about roles and power dynamics in our work and romantic lives, the reality is men harass women all the time because they get away with it, AND they also get mixed messages that make them THINK they got away with it.... Add in the fact that traditional roles want men to initiate all actions, you have a recipe for men and women not working safely together. So the best practice is to create an asexual workplace, be very clear and firm on your own boundaries, and then as men, get out enough that you don't feel you have to hit on people at work.  I think it's important to understand the potential for these things to go south. I'm a straight white male. I had a wonderful female bisexual boss who commented on me being a \"hottie\" as a guy, and my outfit, immediately after I was hit on by a gay client. I've also had a much older coworker bend over and show me their cleavage to embarrass me asking if I'd want to take a photo. The key difference is that nothing was implied as intention in those comments, even the cleavage incident, so I didn't report them. But, both were kind of awkward tbh.  I had a different female boss who asked probing questions and teased me about my sex life, while alone at work on the clock, and I did not answer them and told her I didn't feel comfortable. She quickly wrote me up for something unrelated--at which point yes, I 100% said to HR that btw you should know that person harassed me on the clock about my sex life. Because sadly, people manipulate work relationships and fake friendship dynamics to gain leverage over you. And it would have been better for me to say something before being written up, but frankly with the evidence I had (lots of gossip at that workplace) they believed me.  That boss later cried to me asking why I reported it, and that she thought we were friends. I explained I did it to protect myself and that as a boss she should know better than to try and engage subordinates in conversations about sex. (Which btw, it can come from ANY level but it is clearer if they are a boss).  ...I say all this so you know you're not alone, it is real, it happens to EVERYONE and so you and others can understand the difference in INTENT behind a joke or comment.... His intentions were clearly bad.  I think the real risk here is that if you do nothing, then it will 100% continue for you AND others after you. And you're not doing that older coworker any favors either.  I don't know the guy, but if he's truly old and experienced dating, it sounds like he's a creep and should know better.",

I think it's important to understand the potential for these things to go south. I'm a straight white male. I had a wonderful female bisexual boss who commented on me being a \"hottie\" as a guy, and my outfit, immediately after I was hit on by a gay client. I've also had a much older coworker bend over and show me their cleavage to embarrass me asking if I'd want to take a photo. The key difference is that nothing was implied as intention in those comments, even the cleavage incident, so I didn't report them. But, both were kind of awkward tbh.  I had a different female boss who asked probing questions and teased me about my sex life, while alone at work on the clock, and I did not answer them and told her I didn't feel comfortable. She quickly wrote me up for something unrelated--at which point yes, I 100% said to HR that btw you should know that person harassed me on the clock about my sex life. Because sadly, people manipulate work relationships and fake friendship dynamics to gain leverage over you. And it would have been better for me to say something before being written up, but frankly with the evidence I had (lots of gossip at that workplace) they believed me.  That boss later cried to me asking why I reported it, and that she thought we were friends. I explained I did it to protect myself and that as a boss she should know better than to try and engage subordinates in conversations about sex. (Which btw, it can come from ANY level but it is clearer if they are a boss).  ...I say all this so you know you're not alone, it is real, it happens to EVERYONE and so you and others can understand the difference in INTENT behind a joke or comment.... His intentions were clearly bad.  I think the real risk here is that if you do nothing, then it will 100% continue for you AND others after you. And you're not doing that older coworker any favors either.  I don't know the guy, but if he's truly old and experienced dating, it sounds like he's a creep and should know better."

    "\n\nHuman: [OH] Can I make a reasonable request to be allowed to close my office door under the ADA? I  got a new job in October and this is my position where I have an office  with a door. Previously I had worked from home for about 2 years. I am  an accountant and have ADHD which can be difficult especially since  attention to detail is considered the most important skill in my field.  When I am doing tasks that require high attention to detail, I like to  close my door so I can focus.  My  direct supervisor does not like that I close my door. I explained that I  like to close it sometimes to help me avoid distraction. However she  told me that I should not be closing my door because of the  \u201cperception\u201d. We have discussed this twice and her responses are  consistent. I do not want to disclose my ADHD to her.  Because  I have ADHD could I make a reasonable request to HR to be allowed to  close my door from time to time under the Americans with Disabilities  Act to focus? Especially considering the nature of my work requires high  attention to detail?\n\nAssistant:": {

Keep in mind that they don't have to grant you the accommodation you requested if another exists that also works but they find preferable.

My employee did not submit his timesheet Saturday, or all day Sunday, when he had every opportunity to.

They sent me an email upset that it was submitted without their extra hours.

    "\n\nHuman: [GA] Bad review due to FMLA absences So, I have an issue. I have worked at the same company for over 20 years. We did not get yearly reviews until about 10 years ago. In that time, I have never gotten a bad review. Let's say that the review scale was 1-star for needs improvement, 3 stars for meets expectations, and 4 stars for exceeds, and 5 stars for excellent. I have only gotten 4.5-5 stars for every review. This time, I got a 3 (this review does not affect my pay). When I sat down with my manager, she said all the right things: that I'm an asset, that she appreciates how I handle special projects at the drop of a hat, etc. I was so shocked by my score that I was literally speechless. She accidentally made a comment that she gave me a lower score because I had so many absences in the past year. I am a chronic pain patient, and all my absences were covered by FMLA. I have had this condition since birth, and have missed work occasionally (maybe 6-8x per year) for the first 15 years or so at the company, but in the past 5 years it has gotten worse. Last year was really bad, and I missed about a day a week. In December we were able to get my meds situated better, and I have only missed 3 days so far this year. My boss isn't the brightest bulb in the pack, but she does have power. On one hand, I want to speak with her to get a reason as to why I was scored so low if she thinks so highly of me. A part of me, the child part, is thinking that if she wants to score me as \"meets expectations\" and nothing more, then I will meet expectations and do nothing more. Finally, I have the option of just ignoring it, as it doesn't affect my pay. I know what she did is not right, but not sure if it is \"illegal\" or just a bitch move. Thoughts? Should I speak with her? Leave it alone? I need outside opinions, as I'm still really upset.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Short answer here, and I hope it isn\u2019t removed for brevity, but the majority of labor and arguably the back bone of the Greek economy was slave labor. This I believe at least partially contributed to Greek citizens\u2019 ability to venture into activities not directly contributing to a physical production such as taking up a trade. This freed up the young Greeks mind to pursue more esoteric activities such as thinking about why things are or are not.  Many Greeks, instead of needing to pursue apprenticeship in a labor intensive trade were free to join one of many literal schools of thought. Plato, Aristotle, the stoics, the epicureans, the pathagorians etc... established brick and mortar schools of thinking sometimes occupying the same city squares as other prominent schools. Bertrand Russel writes in his history of western philosophy of how Greeks were often free to choose a school of their liking and simply attend, often free of charge.  He even describes schools who were in close proximity to each other would have their pupils and teachers standing in the streets shouting at young passers by reasons to joint their school and not the one across the street in an attempt to recruit young Greeks unburdened with a trade into their circles.",
            " Oof this can be an extremely complex question to answer. There's mostly contextual and motivational reasons.

        "sft_target": " Short answer here, and I hope it isn\u2019t removed for brevity, but the majority of labor and arguably the back bone of the Greek economy was slave labor. This I believe at least partially contributed to Greek citizens\u2019 ability to venture into activities not directly contributing to a physical production such as taking up a trade. This freed up the young Greeks mind to pursue more esoteric activities such as thinking about why things are or are not.  Many Greeks, instead of needing to pursue apprenticeship in a labor intensive trade were free to join one of many literal schools of thought. Plato, Aristotle, the stoics, the epicureans, the pathagorians etc... established brick and mortar schools of thinking sometimes occupying the same city squares as other prominent schools. Bertrand Russel writes in his history of western philosophy of how Greeks were often free to choose a school of their liking and simply attend, often free of charge.  He even describes schools who were in close proximity to each other would have their pupils and teachers standing in the streets shouting at young passers by reasons to joint their school and not the one across the street in an attempt to recruit young Greeks unburdened with a trade into their circles.",

    "\n\nHuman: Do I have a moral obligation to consume advertising? I'm eternally frustrated by the prevalent reddit attitude about internet advertising and the use of adblock.  Most internet content is funded entirely or at least in part by adverts; the more people who use adblock, the less money these sites (or people on youtube or whatever) earn.  The vast majority of content on the internet is free because it serves to attract readers to those sites.  I am very skeptical about the idea that one might be able to (with a clear conscience) browse to and consume content into which someone else has put time and effort, while actively denying them any compensation for said effort.  It seems the equivalent of looking through the windows of an art gallery with a periscope rather than paying to go on, with the key difference that your experience is actually *improved* vs going in to the gallery.  I don't think I'd be justified in watching a gig or play without paying for it - why can it be justified on the internet?  Now, sure, there's annoying or aggressive advertising.  But there are poorly designed concert venues and bad seats in plays, and neither of these seem to give me the moral justification to break in and consume the content for free.  It seems like the only moral response is to refuse to use the site until it's advertising practices or your tolerance changes.  Am I missing something obvious here?  Is there any solid moral justification for using adblock?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " As an internet marketer, this question will probably sound silly - why do you feel a need to give something to consume something? If capitalism is your ethical framework, I suppose that could be it. As an aside: Is capitalism your ethical framework? If so, it might be super important to reflect on what that really means for you and what types of atrocities are committed under the rubric of capitalism as it is utilized by politicians and states rather than philosophers. But... to follow up, why should an exchange only be monetary? Truly very little content that is valuable goes viral without payment for it to be seen somewhere (i.e. facebook/twitter dumping ads directly into your feed and making it appear as if it was posted by your friends). It'd probably be more realistic (and true to what even google believes the internet to be) that SHARING content you enjoy through relevant web 2.0 channels is a much more impactful thing for a website attempting to monetize through various channels than anything else (for the uninitiated, feel free to check out link juice, pagerank, reasonable surfer, or the other endless ways that algorithms are able to understand strength/value/trustworthiness of various websites).   Beyond that, pretty much anything creating value is going to require a user to click on the ad and not to just view the ad. Sometimes these even require conversions into users or paid accounts. Payments for viewing ads went out of style quite a long time ago, though they still occupy a small subset of the market.   In a slightly different vein, is it unethical to find a competitor's keyword they've paid for on google and ask all of your friends to click on that link? In the world of pure competition and capitalism, attempting to bankrupt or disrupt your competition is not unethical. It's just merely a subset of tactics. While google refers to this as \"black hat,\" let's not play that google is some type of ethical bastion. But, what if you do it to get the website you like $$? Is it equally unethical to turn off *adblock once each month and just click the shit out of their ads? I'm sure the advertisers wouldn't appreciate that.  And my last thing before I walk away - businesses are setting up beacons all over the place to \"tag\" your phone with all sorts of ads. So, you walk through a door (or within 100 meters of a door) to a business and open up facebook and BOOM - their ad is at the top of facebook. Same goes for literally any app on your phone, tablet, laptop, etc. Is it fair that you can be geotargeted based on your location and that they can track your every click/movement/etc. through their cookies that are occupying your phone? Maybe instead they should be required to pay you for viewing the advertisements and for the information that you are likely unknowingly providing them to better improve their ad targeting and revenues, or even for the miniscule amount of space they take up on your device. If you don't think your behavior being tracked isn't the number one reason why their business intelligence creates so many positive outcomes for them, then I suggest you start by reading about your market value instead of pondering over whether making rich companies richer makes you feel unethical (weird question since the power dynamic is wholly different) or you feel sorry for a company because they suck at monetizing their website (why should you be blamed for tactical mistakes of company leaders?).  edited:adblock* was \"reddit ads\" but should have been \"adblock\"",
            " I don't think we have any moral obligation. I see the content and the advertisements as separate. In your examples however, you are paying for the content and its access. I've agreed to give money for access, in the case of advertisements online I have not. The content is free, and the content creator has decided to try to monetise traffic to the site via ads, which is fine, but I don't see any ethical obligation to consume them.  To use one of your analogies, I think its more like advertisements would be if an art gallery had a section dedicated to sponsors. I don't think I would be obligated to go and view it, as its got nothing to do with the content (it isn't the art I'm here to see).   The critical difference is that in your analogies you are paying to access content, which is fair. With websites with ads, it is generally free to access. They intend presumably to counter balance that with the revenue for ads, but that is their business and their choice, and I don't see any obligation to help them succeed financially in that sense, as I wouldn't see that as stealing, given the access to content is free.",

            " anecdote: i live in NYC and was at work one day when my friend mentioned a new pop-up museum to me-- \"the museum of feelings.\"  she said that a few of her friends had gone and thought it was cool and had an enjoyable time.  i looked into it when i got home and it did look cool, nothing outwardly alarming, so me and another one of my friends went a few days later.  the premise of the museum was that there were 5 rooms or so, each one was supposed to be an interactive exhibit representative of a different emotion and on top of that, they were all scented in a way so as to reflect that emotion.  we go through all of the rooms and noticed that the 'art' itself wasn't original but sort of copying the style of other artists.  in the end, we find out that it is not in fact a museum but an advertisement for GLADE CANDLE.  yes.  glade candle promoting their new line of candles.    the thought of a company getting me out of my house, spending 2.75 and an hour and a half one way on the train only to walk through an advertisement imitating art very much bothers me.  advertising went too far.  this does not answer your questions, i realize, but maybe it will give you a different understanding of why some people may want to avoid the incessant bombardment of advertisements.",
            " One could argue that because you did not enter an explicit agreement with the content creator to consume included ads in exchange for content, that it's not quite stealing.  It's kind of like listening to NPR and not contributing.  I suppose you could also say that that's morally objectionable.  (I don't think that holds, because I never hear the \"you're stealing if you don't contribute\" pitch during pledge week, but maybe that's just smart marketing. Still maybe ad blocking and free riding NPR, PBS, and Wikipedia is morally problematic as well.)  You could carry this argument beyond ad blockers to television.  Are you stealing How I Met Your Mother if you fast forward through commercials on your DVR or even just get up to use the restroom during commercial breaks?  On the flip side, do you think that advertisers and/or content creators' bear moral responsibility in serving up high-bandwidth advertising that chews up data cap limits?",

I know that I'm missing something, too, because earlier in the essay he says that there are two kinds of existentialism\u2014Christian and atheistic\u2014but then fails to explain what the former would look like, aside from referring to Jaspers and Gabriel Marcel.\n\nAssistant:": {

Hello, my acquaintance with philosophy is tangential at best, I took a two course sequence on Ancient Greek philosophy in college that covered the pre-socratics, Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, Epictetus, etc. The only other philosophy course I've taken is The Philosophy of Language and we used Frege: Philosophy of Language by Michael Dummett as our main text. I've also read The Frege Reader as it was recommended supplementary material for that class.  My mathematics is pretty standard. I have an upper level undergrad's understanding of topology, differential geometry, Fourier analysis, Functional analysis, Real Analysis (at the level of Papa Rudin), etc. My Algebra is a tad bit better and I've taken a commutative Algebra course based around the textbooks by Miles Reid and Michael Atiyah.  Another recommended book for that class was \"Naming and necessity\" by Saul Kripke which I opted not to read. Would this be a good starting point for me? I remember that my favorite part of Ancient Greek philosophy was Aristotle's Metaphysics so that's what I'd really like to focus on learning more about.\n\nAssistant:": {

Since I recognize that it is produced, according to the label, by a reputable cereal company known for its honesty, I decide to trust the information. I buy a box of Bran Blobs.  > * Case 3: In the supermarket I spot a box of Bran Blobs on the shelf with a fetching picture of Cameron Diaz on it. I buy a box of Bran Blobs.  > * Case 4: In the supermarket I approach a box of Bran Blobs which has a secret microchip transponder that tweaks the nucleus accumbens in my brain.

The chief difference between cases 3 and 4 is that in case 4 I have no idea that an attempt to manipulate me is occurring. Notice that if the world comes to be infested with such microchip persuaders, we will all be in the market for countermeasures, devices that will detect and disarm the secret manipulators so that we can maintain our integrity as rational agents. There has been for millennia an arms race between persuaders and their targets or intended victims. Folklore is full of tales of innocents being taken in by the blandishments of sharp talkers. This folklore is part of the defense we pass on to our children, so that they will become adept at guarding against it. We don\u2019t want our children to become puppets.

            " It's a complicated question.  What the two clearly have in common, at minimum, is that both are modes of influence.  One way that people try to separate the two is that persuasion, as such, involves at its end an act of judgment whereas manipulation, as such, aims at either somehow thwarting or subverting the act of judgment.   (Burke *Rhetoric of Motives* and Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca *New Rhetoric* - Parker's \"Rhetoric, Ethics and Manipulation\" would be helpful here.)   This is one the places where the idea of Discourse Ethics and the Ideal Speech Situation is born - that when we find ourselves in the space of reasons we're distinctly in a space where people are meant to be giving and taking reasons to be submitted equally to the judgment of everyone else around.  For people who see communication this way (ex: Habermas), this is where the legitimacy of deliberative democracy is ultimately grounded - in deliberative procedures which end in a certain kind of judgment.  In an important way, these ideas are super old and are extensions of the ideas of Isocrates as we might find in, for instance, *Antidosis*.  There are two sorts of moves against this way of seeing things:  1. The move by the classical Sophists to say that, no, it's basically manipulation all the way down - or something like it.  Like, this judgment stuff is a very nice story but, sorry, it's tricks all the way down.  Gorgias makes a version of this argument in \"The Encomium of Helen,\" and it's part of this idea we see played out in Plato that sophistic rhetoric is a kind of drug - a *pharmakon*, just like the one later developed by Derrida concerning writing. 2. The move by feminist scholars to say that, even worse, that this rational narrative about persuasion is just not so and that we need to think differently about how we use language in these contexts and, instead, aim not to persuade but to do something like \"invite.\"  Foss & Griffin's \"Beyond Persuasion: A Proposal for an Invitational Rhetoric\" is one of the early texts about this.  Anyway, basically any of the major treatises on rhetoric from basically whenever try to treat this topic in one way or another."

One way that people try to separate the two is that persuasion, as such, involves at its end an act of judgment whereas manipulation, as such, aims at either somehow thwarting or subverting the act of judgment.   (Burke *Rhetoric of Motives* and Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca *New Rhetoric* - Parker's \"Rhetoric, Ethics and Manipulation\" would be helpful here.)   This is one the places where the idea of Discourse Ethics and the Ideal Speech Situation is born - that when we find ourselves in the space of reasons we're distinctly in a space where people are meant to be giving and taking reasons to be submitted equally to the judgment of everyone else around.  For people who see communication this way (ex: Habermas), this is where the legitimacy of deliberative democracy is ultimately grounded - in deliberative procedures which end in a certain kind of judgment.  In an important way, these ideas are super old and are extensions of the ideas of Isocrates as we might find in, for instance, *Antidosis*.  There are two sorts of moves against this way of seeing things:  1. The move by the classical Sophists to say that, no, it's basically manipulation all the way down - or something like it.  Like, this judgment stuff is a very nice story but, sorry, it's tricks all the way down.  Gorgias makes a version of this argument in \"The Encomium of Helen,\" and it's part of this idea we see played out in Plato that sophistic rhetoric is a kind of drug - a *pharmakon*, just like the one later developed by Derrida concerning writing. 2. The move by feminist scholars to say that, even worse, that this rational narrative about persuasion is just not so and that we need to think differently about how we use language in these contexts and, instead, aim not to persuade but to do something like \"invite.\"  Foss & Griffin's \"Beyond Persuasion: A Proposal for an Invitational Rhetoric\" is one of the early texts about this.  Anyway, basically any of the major treatises on rhetoric from basically whenever try to treat this topic in one way or another.",

From one of culture\u2019s greatest inventions: the forum of informed persuasion, governed by consensual rules of argument and persuasion. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now. Philosophy, or more particularly *practical* philosophy, is the project where intelligent designers have attempted to assess, critique, improve, and ultimately *justify* the principles we all should live by. We might call this process *political science* if that term hadn\u2019t been appropriated. This process is, like science more generally, a fallible but self-critical, self-improving, self-conscious inquiry into the project of establishing and maintaining norms and laws that will optimize (in a sense which is itself very much subject to critical adjustment) the well-being of all. (All what? Another revisable category.)  >...  >...  > Here is another intuition pump that makes a somewhat different point about the role of knowledge in free will (drawn from my 2012 Erasmus Lecture: \u201cSometimes a Spin Doctor is Right\u201d):  > * Case 1: My doctor, whom I know well, and trust, advises me to eat Bran Blobs for breakfast because it is the best way to lower my cholesterol. The effect of this audiovisual experience is that I go to the supermarket and buy a box of Bran Blobs.  > * Case 2: In the supermarket, I decide to try a new cereal. Never having heard of Bran Blobs before, I pull a box off the shelf and carefully read all the information on it (highlighted in bright yellow) about the nutritional value and zesty taste of Bran Blobs. Since I recognize that it is produced, according to the label, by a reputable cereal company known for its honesty, I decide to trust the information. I buy a box of Bran Blobs.  > * Case 3: In the supermarket I spot a box of Bran Blobs on the shelf with a fetching picture of Cameron Diaz on it. I buy a box of Bran Blobs.  > * Case 4: In the supermarket I approach a box of Bran Blobs which has a secret microchip transponder that tweaks the nucleus accumbens in my brain. I buy a box of Bran Blobs.  >In each case, various features of the environment and its stimulation of my nervous system cause me to buy a box of Bran Blobs. Moreover, in each case, there is an attempt to influence my choice by other agents. But while the first two openly exploit my rationality and give me reasons I can endorse (or not) for making the purchase, the next two cases effectively bypass my rationality. Case 3 might be seriously manipulative if it were directed against some truly naive and sheltered person, but I am no babe in the woods; I know all about how companies use sex appeal to sell things, but for years I\u2019ve been a fan of Cameron Diaz, who is as intelligent as she is beautiful, so I buy it as a souvenir. (If Bran Blobs had a picture of Carl Sagan or David Attenborough on the box, I\u2019d buy half a dozen.) The chief difference between cases 3 and 4 is that in case 4 I have no idea that an attempt to manipulate me is occurring. Notice that if the world comes to be infested with such microchip persuaders, we will all be in the market for countermeasures, devices that will detect and disarm the secret manipulators so that we can maintain our integrity as rational agents. There has been for millennia an arms race between persuaders and their targets or intended victims. Folklore is full of tales of innocents being taken in by the blandishments of sharp talkers. This folklore is part of the defense we pass on to our children, so that they will become adept at guarding against it. We don\u2019t want our children to become puppets. If philosophers and neuroscientists are saying that it is no use \u2013 we are all already puppets, controlled by the environment, they are making a big, and potentially harmful, mistake.  >...  *-- Excerpt from 'Just Deserts: Debating Free Will' by Daniel C.

            " I've been reading Martin Luther King's autobiography and he discussed his views on Marx. I found his views quite fascinating thought you might as well:  \"*During the Christmas holidays of 1949 I decided to spend my spare time reading Karl Marx to try to understand the appeal of communism for many people. For the first time I carefully scrutinized 'Das Kapital' and 'The Communist Manifesto'. I also read some interpretive works on the thinking of Marx and Lenin. In reading such Communist writings I drew certain conclusions that have remained with me as convictions to this day.*  *First, I rejected their materialistic interpretation of history. Communism, avowedly secularistic and materialistic, has no place for God. This I could never accept, for as a Christian I believe that there is a creative personal power in this universe who is the ground and essence of all reality - a power that cannot be explained in materialistic terms. History is ultimately guided by spirit, not matter.*  *Second, I strongly disagreed with communism's ethical relativism. Since for the Community there is no divine government, no absolute moral order, there are no fixed, immutable principles; consequently almost anything - force, violence, murder, lying - is a justifiable means to the \"millenial\" end. This type of relativism was abhorrent to me. Constructive ends can never give absolute moral justification to destructive means, because in the final analysis the end is preexistent in the means.*  *Third, I opposed communism's political totalitarianism. In communism the individual ends up in subjection to the state. True, the Marxist would argue that the state is an \"interim\" reality which is to be eliminated when the classless society emerges; but the state is the end while it lasts, and man only a means to that end. And if any man's so-called rights or liberties stand in the way of that end, they are simply swept aside. His liberties of expression, his freedom to vote, his freedom to listen to what news he likes or to choose his books are all restricted. Man becomes hardly more, in communism, than a depersonalized cog in the turning wheel of the state.*  *This deprecation of individual freedom was objectionable to me. I am convinced now, as I was then, that man is an end because he is a child of God. Man is not made for the state; the state is made for man. To deprive man of freedom is to relegate him to the status of a thing, rather than elevate him to the status of a person. Man must never be treated as a means to the end of the state, but always as an end within himself.*  *Yet, in spite of the fact that my response to communism was an is negative, and I consider it basically evil, there were points at which I found it challenging. With all of its false assumptions and evil methods, communism grew as a protest against the hardships of the underprivileged. Communism in theory emphasized a classless society, and a concern for social justice, though the world knows from sad experience that in practice it created new classes and a new lexicon of injustice. The Christian ought always to be challenged by any protest against unfair treatment of the poor.*  *I also sought systematic answers to Marx's critique of modern bourgeois culture. He presented capitalism as essentially a struggle between the owners of the productive resources and the workers, whom Marx regarded as the real producers. Marx interpreted economic forces as the dialectical process by which society moved from feudalism through capitalism to socialism, with the primary mechanism of this historical movement being the struggle between economic classes whose interests were irreconcilable. Obviously this theory left out the numerous and significant complexities - political, economic, moral, religious, and psychological - which played a vital role in shaping the constellation of institutions and ideas known today as Western civilization. Moreover, it was dated in the sense that the capitalism Marx wrote about bore only a partial resemblance to the capitalism we know in this country.*   *But in spite of the shortcomings of his analysis, Marx had raised some basic questions. I was deeply concerned from my early teen days about the gulf between superfluous wealth and abject poverty, and my reading of Marx made me ever more conscious of this gulf. Although modern American capitalism had greatly reduced the gap through social reforms, there was still need for a better distribution of wealth. Moreover, Marx had revealed the danger of the profit motive as the sole basis of an economic system: capitalism is always in danger of inspiring men to be more concerned about making a living than making life. We are prone to judge success by the index of our salaries or the size of our automobiles, rather than by the quality of our service and relationship to humanity. Thus capitalism can lead to a practical materialism that is as pernicious as the materialism taught by communism.\"*",

And if any man's so-called rights or liberties stand in the way of that end, they are simply swept aside. His liberties of expression, his freedom to vote, his freedom to listen to what news he likes or to choose his books are all restricted. Man becomes hardly more, in communism, than a depersonalized cog in the turning wheel of the state.*  *This deprecation of individual freedom was objectionable to me. I am convinced now, as I was then, that man is an end because he is a child of God. Man is not made for the state; the state is made for man. To deprive man of freedom is to relegate him to the status of a thing, rather than elevate him to the status of a person. Man must never be treated as a means to the end of the state, but always as an end within himself.*  *Yet, in spite of the fact that my response to communism was an is negative, and I consider it basically evil, there were points at which I found it challenging. With all of its false assumptions and evil methods, communism grew as a protest against the hardships of the underprivileged. Communism in theory emphasized a classless society, and a concern for social justice, though the world knows from sad experience that in practice it created new classes and a new lexicon of injustice. The Christian ought always to be challenged by any protest against unfair treatment of the poor.*  *I also sought systematic answers to Marx's critique of modern bourgeois culture. He presented capitalism as essentially a struggle between the owners of the productive resources and the workers, whom Marx regarded as the real producers. Marx interpreted economic forces as the dialectical process by which society moved from feudalism through capitalism to socialism, with the primary mechanism of this historical movement being the struggle between economic classes whose interests were irreconcilable. Obviously this theory left out the numerous and significant complexities - political, economic, moral, religious, and psychological - which played a vital role in shaping the constellation of institutions and ideas known today as Western civilization. Moreover, it was dated in the sense that the capitalism Marx wrote about bore only a partial resemblance to the capitalism we know in this country.*   *But in spite of the shortcomings of his analysis, Marx had raised some basic questions. I was deeply concerned from my early teen days about the gulf between superfluous wealth and abject poverty, and my reading of Marx made me ever more conscious of this gulf. Although modern American capitalism had greatly reduced the gap through social reforms, there was still need for a better distribution of wealth. Moreover, Marx had revealed the danger of the profit motive as the sole basis of an economic system: capitalism is always in danger of inspiring men to be more concerned about making a living than making life. We are prone to judge success by the index of our salaries or the size of our automobiles, rather than by the quality of our service and relationship to humanity. Thus capitalism can lead to a practical materialism that is as pernicious as the materialism taught by communism.\"*"

        "sft_target": " I've been reading Martin Luther King's autobiography and he discussed his views on Marx. I found his views quite fascinating thought you might as well:  \"*During the Christmas holidays of 1949 I decided to spend my spare time reading Karl Marx to try to understand the appeal of communism for many people. For the first time I carefully scrutinized 'Das Kapital' and 'The Communist Manifesto'. I also read some interpretive works on the thinking of Marx and Lenin. In reading such Communist writings I drew certain conclusions that have remained with me as convictions to this day.*  *First, I rejected their materialistic interpretation of history. Communism, avowedly secularistic and materialistic, has no place for God. This I could never accept, for as a Christian I believe that there is a creative personal power in this universe who is the ground and essence of all reality - a power that cannot be explained in materialistic terms. History is ultimately guided by spirit, not matter.*  *Second, I strongly disagreed with communism's ethical relativism. Since for the Community there is no divine government, no absolute moral order, there are no fixed, immutable principles; consequently almost anything - force, violence, murder, lying - is a justifiable means to the \"millenial\" end. This type of relativism was abhorrent to me. Constructive ends can never give absolute moral justification to destructive means, because in the final analysis the end is preexistent in the means.*  *Third, I opposed communism's political totalitarianism. In communism the individual ends up in subjection to the state. True, the Marxist would argue that the state is an \"interim\" reality which is to be eliminated when the classless society emerges; but the state is the end while it lasts, and man only a means to that end. And if any man's so-called rights or liberties stand in the way of that end, they are simply swept aside.

Teaching at a community college is different from teaching at Harvard or Yale.  I teach at a midsize, private liberal arts uni in the US. I teach 3 classes per semester with 25ish students per section. My typical day involves prepping for teaching (anywhere from 30 minutes to 2.5 hours, depending on the material), teaching, research (usually 1-2 hours if I'm lucky), responding to emails, grading, and committee work.  I'd say I work 8-9 hours a day and a 4 hours on the weekend if needed.   For classes, I teach 2 sections of critical thinking and one section of an upper division course that fulfills uni curriculum requirements.  I think I'm probably pretty average for workload. Some folks get tenure and then do next to nothing. Others work 60-80 hours a week. Work-life balance is a real struggle for many academics.   Salary depends on where you live and work. Mine is good. I can afford to buy a house and occasionally take a vacation. But you won't be making 6-figures at most places until after at least a decade or two, if at all. You definitely don't go into this job for the money.  I'm very lucky. I like my colleagues (most days) and my students (most days). I get to do research on interesting issues and talk with fascinating people.   But let me say that many aren't as lucky as I am. The philosophy job market is brutal. 300 people applied for my job 7 or 8 years ago, all of them with PhDs, teaching experience, and publications. Many people spend 7 to 10 years getting a PhD and then maybe a few more in temporary positions only to realize they'll never get a permanent job. I advise undergraduates to find another way to indulge their love of philosophy without getting a PhD or going into academia. So ask yourself: what do you love about philosophy? Could you be happy majoring in it and then maybe teaching high school with a few units on philosophy? Of course you're in high school and there's no need to figure out your life plan right now, but the more you know, etc.  Make no mistake: I think philosophy is intrinsically valuable.

            " Honestly, if you can do anything else, go do that thing. Don't go into academia.  Everything is ultra-competitive. Pedigree matters a ton. And if you're a white, male philosopher, the profession is (rightfully) correcting against the over-saturation of old white guys in the profession.  Now look, if you want to pursue a PhD because you're interested, fine. But really don't rely on getting a job. If you look around on the internet, you'll likely only find stories of professors. There's a selection bias there and a survivorship bias. Only the successful get publicized. But for every successful professor, there are dozens of people who didn't make it.  You're young, so who knows what you'll find? But I'd highly encourage anyone to consider other alternatives and not go into the field right now. Keep your finger on the pulse of the industry to see if something changes. But it's largely not worth it. The pay is middling at best (other educators often make way more, e.g., teaching secondary school). You go where the jobs are (so you have little autonomy in where you live). Your responsibilities are likely set by the Department or College, which means you're on the hook for lots of service work. And the pressure to publish means that you're never off the clock. You're looking at a competitive 4 years for your bachelor's. Then (unless you go to Oxford or Cambridge) another 1-2 years for a master's to try to get into a good PhD program. Then 5-7 years in the PhD program, where you're working your ass of to get a shot at a job. And then if you do get a job (huge if), you're looking at 5 years of busting your ass in publishing, service, and teaching to prove to the uni that you're worth keeping on with tenure.  I say all this to change your expectations. If you go in, thinking it'll be a nice, casual job where you get to live the life of mind: don't. That's the wrong way to see it. But if you go into it realizing that it's cut-throat competitive and there's a ton of bullshit, but that you think it's worth it nonetheless, that's OK. Whether it's worth it will be up to you.",

    "\n\nHuman: Dr. Jordan Peterson gets a bad rep on r/badphilosophy, why is that? Young philosophy student with some questions. I just finished listening to Peterson on the JRE podcast and thought it was definitely the most interesting one I've listened to.   But let me give a quick disclaimer: I'm young and a beginner in philosophy and still in the midst of forming a lot of my fundamental ideas. I was a deep rational-minded atheist and Harrisite for the longest time before I experienced an \"awakening\" of some sort, which was kind of a slap in the face to my believed skepticism at the time. I won't go into detail, but it was some sort of thought-synchronization between my SO and myself, in which we seemed to share the exact same thought, same perspective, same mind. The closest thing I've found to an explanation is Carl Jung's synchronicity, as it really was some sort of death-and-rebirth experience for both us.    Reason I've explained this is to demonstrate where my mind is at now, which is an attitude of true skepticism. Everything I thought I knew and believed about my identity and the nature of reality has collapsed, and I've been left with a clean slate in my search for truth. This has led me to all kinds of different philosophers, such as Alan Watts and Joseph Campbell, as well as various eastern philosophies like Taoism and Zen Buddhism.   But let me be clear: My ideas are not fixed. While my worldview has certainly been expanded by these people and beliefs, they're more like notions I entertain without attaching my sense of self, if that makes sense.   This has now led me to a public figure who is growing in popularity: Jordan Peterson. I agreed with a lot of his opinions on the post-modern SJW movement and it was a breath of fresh air for me, being surrounded by a very leftist environment (not political either because I don't know enough about political theory/philosophy to take a stance). But what really stuck out to me is his analysis on archetypes.   In the JRE, he explains how he's religious despite being a scientist, and his explanation is that science tells us how things work and what they are, but religious fundamentals tell us how we should live, a map of morality if you will. This really stood out to me, because it emphasized some idea I've had for a while: that all these different religions and philosophies share the same core themes. He then goes into archetypes and how the reason so many fictional stories share these archetypal themes, like two brothers fighting (Good/Evil, God/Lucifer) or Harry Potter confronting the basilisk underneath the castle (facing your deep-rooted fears) is our collective unconscious manifesting itself into imaginative fiction. This was an incredibly interesting perspective to me, had to rewind it multiple times to really absorb what he was saying.   Then I go on the r/badphilosophy subreddit and search his name and I found nothing but negative criticism, which was a bit surprising to me. I started delving into the reasons why, as I'm always eager to gain the other side's perspective, and was disappointed to find that while many dismissed him, few actually explained WHY they felt he was wrong. The closest I've found to explaining this criticism is his stance on Marxism and the post-modern left taking over. I do not know enough about Marxism to have an opinion yet, but I'm still eager to know what rebuttals to his spiritual stance could be. Thank you in advance!\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Okay. So what the author claims is that moral standards somehow come from God\u2019s nature rather than God\u2019s commands. Since they don\u2019t come from God\u2019s commands they aren\u2019t arbitrary, and since they are (part of) God\u2019s nature they aren\u2019t independent of God.  So it\u2019s moral realism, where the moral facts are (within) God\u2019s nature.   And I guess that\u2019s a view one could hold. It does seem to avoid the arbitrariness objection to divine command theory.  But I don\u2019t understand is why it\u2019s so bad for moral principles to be independent of God. The author says that would challenge God\u2019s omnipotence and independence. But, no it wouldn\u2019t? I\u2019ve heard people say stuff like this, but I\u2019ve never really found a compelling argument that the existence of moral facts would somehow impinge God\u2019s power.  So I guess if you really don\u2019t like the idea of morality being independent from God, this is a sensible view to adopt. But if that doesn\u2019t bother you, there\u2019s no great reason to adopt this view as opposed to plain old moral realism (or some alternative meta-ethical view).   Further, this means the view doesn\u2019t really establish the dependence of morality on God (if the view is true, morality depends upon God, but accepting the view means you should accept plain old moral realism as a possibility as well). So, if you want a moral argument for the existence of God, this view probably isn\u2019t going to be much help, unless you have a further argument against other versions of moral realism (and other meta-ethical theories).",
            " It's by no means a circular argument and is the answer traditionally given by commentators on the dilemma, most notably St. Anselm. The argument traditionally follows that \"God is good\" is a literal identity, that goodness is simply a logical extension of the telos already present in God. You can also find a similar project in Hegel's 'unity of subject and object,' where it is the inferential terms upon which the word 'God' is predicated which work themselves out in the context of world history which endow the world with moral truth.",

            " It doesn't seem circular to me. Actually, I'd say this is the answer you will commonly encounter when asking classical theists.

Now, what is good and what is bad is determined by an objective 'standard of morality', which isn't subject to change.

            " The Euthyphro dilemma isn't, at least not evidently, a problem, so there's no evident need for any solution here. Sometimes in casual conversation we use the word 'dilemma' to mean *problem*, but here the word is being used in the technical sense to mean a situation where there is a choice between two options. There's no solution needed to this situation, as it isn't a problem: you can just pick an option.  Somewhere people got it in their heads that the Euthyphro dilemma is not only a problem, but moreover a problem for theism, and amounts to an argument for atheism, by purporting to show that either horn of the dilemma contradicts theism. This isn't right, certainly it's not right in the obvious ways: It's not right in terms of the origins of the dilemma in Plato's text *Euthyphro*, which doesn't contain any such argument, nor is it right of the bulk of the reception of these issues in the history of philosophy and theology.  What happens in Plato's dialogue *Euthyphro*, from which we derive this dilemma, is that Socrates' interlocutor, Euthyphro, purports to be an expert on matters of piety, and so Socrates asks him to define it, Euthyphro is unable to give a consistent definition of piety, and Socrates takes this as evidence that Euthyphro wasn't the expert he claimed to be, or that expertise oughtn't be understood in the way Euthyphro understands it. This is a pretty typical way Socratic dialogues are organized. There's nothing here about an argument for atheism: the dilemma comes up in the course of trying to find a definition for piety, when Socrates asks Euthyphro whether the pious is pious because it is loved by the gods, or whether it is loved by the gods because it is pious. In the context of their discussion, the significance of this question is that Euthyphro doesn't understand the difference Socrates is getting at and gets confused about it, so that when Euthyphro takes one horn of the dilemma Socrates can readily lead him into taking the other one, and vice-versa, with Euthyphro left having no consistent position at all.  In the development of this theme in the history of philosophy and theology, others have tended to fare rather better than Euthyphro does. There have been many able defenders of the view that God loves the pious because it is pious, which gets called an anti-voluntarist or intellectualist view, and able defenders also of the view that the pious is pious because God loves it, which gets called a voluntarist view.  Partisans of one camp object to features of the contrary view, but this is how disputes usually work -- it's not a sign that there's some underlying problem for theism here. The intellectualists think the voluntarist's criticisms fall flat, which is why they remain intellectualists; and the voluntarists think the intellectualist's criticisms fall flat, which is why they remain voluntarists. The atheist may well wish to argue that each side's criticisms of the other are compelling, for which reason both sides err and the solution is to be an atheist. But of course, again, the intellectualist doesn't agree that the voluntarist's criticisms are compelling, and vice-versa, so they're liable to stick to their positions rather than take this as evidence of some underlying problem with theism. We as readers and thinkers may find ourselves siding with one or another of these views, depending on our assessment of their arguments. But again there's no evident need for a \"solution\" to the dilemma, since people can and do continue to adopt the usual responses of defending voluntarism or intellectualism, which is perfectly in line with the dilemma rather than some kind of destruction of it.  The distinction between the voluntarist and the intellectualist goes much further than being an ad hoc response to the Euthyphro dilemma, and concerns a fundamental disagreement about the underlying nature of norms -- though certainly one's theological commitments may motivate them in one or another direction on the matter. The voluntarist is inclined to think of norms in terms of relations of sovereignty implying obligations, so that for instance I have obligations to my landowner to make certain safeguards on the state of my property, I have obligations to the state to recognize lawful claims on property rights, and so on, all according to whether there is a due relation of sovereignty and what is lawfully, under the terms of that sovereignty, commanded by the sovereign. Many people have found this to be a model of norms which is appealingly intuitive, in that they understand how we can have obligations to due authorities. The intellectualist, conversely, is inclined to think of norms as in some sense a feature of the fabric of things, where to act justly, for instance, is to act according to certain intellectually-identifiable orders of proportion, in a manner analogous to how, say, solving an algebra equation proceeds according to norms of proportion. If one finds either of these conceptions of norms particularly compelling, this is going to determine how one answers the Euthyphro dilemma. But again there's no evident need for a \"solution\" here, one can just answer the dilemma in the intellectualist manner or in the voluntarist manner.  Probably the most well-known traditional source on this is the dispute between Leibniz and Pufendorf, so it may be a useful illustration to quote some of that:  > It remains now to treat the efficient cause of [the natural law], which our author does not correctly establish. He, indeed, does not find it in the nature of things and in the precepts of right reason which Conform to it, which emanate from the divine understanding, but (what will appear to be strange and contradictory) in the command of a superior... If we admit this, no one will do his duty spontaneously... Now, then, will he who is invested with the supreme power do nothing against justice if he proceeds tyrannically against his subjects; who arbitrarily despoils his subjects, torments them, and kills them under torture; who makes war on others without cause...?  > To pass over all this, one must pay attention to this fact: that God is praised because he is just. There must be, then, a certain justice - or rather a supreme justice - in God, even though no one is superior to him, and he, by the spontaneity of his excellent nature, accomplishes all things well, such that no one can reasonably complain of him. Neither the norm of conduct itself, nor the essence of the just, depends on his free decision, but rather on eternal truths, objects of the divine intellect, which constitute, so to speak, the essence of divinity itself;  > and it is right that our author is reproached by theologians when he maintains the contrary; because, I believe, he had not seen the wicked consequences which arise from it. Justice, indeed, would not be an essential attribute of God, if he himself established justice and law by his free will. And, indeed, justice follows certain rules of equality and of proportion [which are] no less founded in the immutable nature of things, and in the divine ideas, than are the principles of arithmetic and of geometry... It would follow from [the contrary view], too, that which some people have imprudently said, that God could with justice condemn an innocent person, since he could make it such that precisely this would constitute justice... This has also not a little relevance for the practice of true piety: it is not enough, indeed, that we be subject to God just as we would obey a tyrant; nor must he be only feared because of his greatness, but also loved because of his goodness: which right reason teaches, no less than the Scriptures.  > To this lead the best principles of universal jurisprudence, which collaborate also with wise theology and bring about true virtue. Thus he who acts well, not out of hope or fear, but by an inclination of his soul, is so far from not behaving justly that, on the contrary, he acts more justly than all others, imitating, in a certain way, as a man, divine justice. Whoever, indeed, does good out of love for God or of his neighbor, takes pleasure precisely in the action itself (such being the nature of love) and does not need any other incitement, or the command of a superior; for that man the saying that the law is not made for the just is valid. To such a degree is it repugnant to reason to say that only the law or constraint make a man just... (Leibniz, *Opinions on the Principles of Pufendorf*, \u00a74)  So we see here Leibniz giving the usual arguments against the voluntarist. But he doesn't treat this point as if it shows the dilemma needs somehow to be destructed, rather he just takes the other horn: he's an intellectualist. And this decision is well-founded in the details of the relevant arguments, in which the dilemma returns: for instance, the worry that God cannot meaningfully be praised for his goodness if goodness is defined as whatever God does, can only be resolved if we reject that definition, but then we're not \"solving\" the dilemma we're just picking a side within it.  This is not to say, of course, that working out the details of the relevant theology and moral philosophy won't involve some difficulties, difficulties which may either require solutions or pose themselves as arguments against theism. But I do think a lot of the popular commentary on the Euthyphro dilemma gets mixed up in ways that we can clarify by keeping the above points in mind.",

    "\n\nHuman: How fast would an electron have to spin if its spin was classical rotation? As I attempt to learn more about quantum physics from the laypersons point of view, I've seen several times the explanation that an electron has a property called spin, but this spin cannot be classical rotation. This is because its outermost shell (if we assume its volume actually occupies the entire space) would have to move faster than the speed of light in order to produce the amount of energy/momentum that we measure.  My question is: exactly how much faster than light would it have to move in order to produce the energy or momentum we actually measure?\n\nAssistant:": {

People rarely ask \"How can I imagine charge and what is it made of\", but the analogy with a spinning top lets people think they can somehow grasp the idea of spin in a classical way.  You can't. Mass, charge, spin are simply properties of particles. And while you can add charges or masses in a trivial way, you have to use angular momentum algebra to add spins.",

    "\n\nHuman: Integrals in phase space, and what even *is* action? I'm pretty new to physics in general, and a while ago I came across the concept of action in the context of a classical harmonic oscillator. The book I was reading said that the area enclosed by the elliptical trajectory of a 1D oscillator in phase space is equal to the action of the system. It turned out to be too high level, so I didn't read much beyond this.  More recently I learned that action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian, kinetic energy (T) - potential energy (U), with respect to time. I thought it might help clarify things\\* if I could relate this definition to the area enclosed by the phase space trajectory, as that's easy to visualise for a 1D system.  To do this I tried taking the standard equation of an ellipse, then integrating \\1/(2m) p^(2) \\- k/2 x^(2)\\] with respect to dt. I did this by multiplying the integrand by m/p and then integrating with respect to dx (as m/p = 1/v = dt/dx). I assumed that if I evaluated the integral between x=0 and x=a for positive p then this would be equal to 1/4 of the total action for one oscillation, as (in this case) T - U doesn't depend on the direction of motion nor the sign of x. So I was expecting to get (\u03c0/4)\\*ab, i.e. 1/4 of the area of the ellipse, but in fact I got zero.  As I said I'm new to all this so it's entirely possible I just screwed up the integration. But the longer I think about it, the more I feel like even in that case, I'm missing something more fundamental too. For one thing, T - U is positive along some parts of the trajectory and negative along others, and it's hard to reconcile that with the idea that it's equal to the area. But more importantly, the area enclosed by the ellipse seems to be equal to the product of the *total* energy of the system and its period, which is surely equal to the integral of T **+** U with respect to time. As U is non-zero, clearly T + U and T - U can't be the same.  So... what gives? Have I totally misunderstood and done a nonsense calculation somewhere? Are there two different quantities that can be calculated for the same system, both called action?? The [wikipedia article#Action_of_a_generalized_coordinate) does mention integrating around a closed path in phase space, but unfortunately I don't know enough to really understand what it's saying there. I couldn't find much else on the internet to help, or at least nothing written at a level I can follow.  This has been driving me up the wall for days so if anyone can put me out of my misery I will be extremely grateful! I don't know a whole lot about maths especially, so if you could explain in as simple terms as possible that would be really great.  \\*irony amirite\n\nAssistant:": {

            " There is this myth that quantum effects are only gaugeable either at the microscopic level or in much weird phenomena, like superfluidity.  But quantum effects are pervasive in everyday life. A brief and non exhaustive listing:  - Magnetism in matter (existence of magnets) is a pure quantum effect. A nonzero magnetization (either para-, ferro- or diamagnetic) is easily ruled out in classical physics by a quite general theorem by Bohr and van Leeuwen. So if you want to account for magnetic response of materials you need a quamtum mechanical treatment of those materials.   - Black body radiation (which was one of the actual triggers of everything and for that reason taught in every basic course about modern physics, so I can't understand how is today overlooked so easily in divulgation). In a classical physics world every body at nonzero temperature would irradiate infinite energy, increasing in intensity as you increase frequency (dubbed UV catastrophe)... Which just isn't and cannot be. It's a very huge everyday proof of quantumness of the world.  - Specific heat of solids. The quantitative behavior of specific heat as a function of temperature is accountable only if microscopic degrees of freedom are treated quantum mechanically. Be careful: *micro*scopic degrees of freedom, but specific heat is a thermodynamical quantity and as such is *macro*scopic. Exactly the same as magnetization.  - More..  What you normally don't see in the macroscopic world is just the most striking and counterintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics, like large scale coherence and superpositions (like Schrodinger's cat..). But this is inherent in the very concept of counterintuitive, isn't it? Nevertheless there are some few cases in which you can see macroscopic quantum coherence (superfluidity, superconductivity..) and that's why these effects are so popular in divulgation, they are truly amazing! But don't overlook the everyday life ones, it's quite cool that quantum mechanics is everywhere, under your eyes :)"

First, the one we currently use: the EHT, or \"Event Horizon Telescope\", uses a technique called \"long baseline interferometry\" to combine radio signals from telescopes around the globe. This combined signal lets the scientists in the project \"take a picture of a black hole\", which was released last year! https://eventhorizontelescope.org/  The second approach that would work very well for space based clusters of telescopes is the idea being LISA, which works differently that what you're thinking, but is still really cool. Rather than looking for electromagnetic waves (light, radio, etc), this fleet of three telescopes would use lasers between them to measure the timing of the literal change in spacetime due to gravitational waves! These three craft would be in orbit around the sun millions of miles from one another, so certainly meets your ideas of a \"telescope the size of the Earth\". While the mission itself is still in the planning stages, the technique is known to work and a demonstration mission has been flown. https://www.lisamission.org/  For some really interesting descriptions and analysis of these projects, I'd encourage you to pick up a copy of \"Once you start asking\" by Marcus Voelter. He runs a podcast called Omega Tau, where he's interviewed scientists and engineers from these and many other \"megaprojects\".  http://omegataupodcast.net/once-you-start-asking/  The last one I'd point out is the idea of using the sun itself as a gravitational lense.

First, the one we currently use: the EHT, or \"Event Horizon Telescope\", uses a technique called \"long baseline interferometry\" to combine radio signals from telescopes around the globe. This combined signal lets the scientists in the project \"take a picture of a black hole\", which was released last year! https://eventhorizontelescope.org/  The second approach that would work very well for space based clusters of telescopes is the idea being LISA, which works differently that what you're thinking, but is still really cool. Rather than looking for electromagnetic waves (light, radio, etc), this fleet of three telescopes would use lasers between them to measure the timing of the literal change in spacetime due to gravitational waves! These three craft would be in orbit around the sun millions of miles from one another, so certainly meets your ideas of a \"telescope the size of the Earth\". While the mission itself is still in the planning stages, the technique is known to work and a demonstration mission has been flown. https://www.lisamission.org/  For some really interesting descriptions and analysis of these projects, I'd encourage you to pick up a copy of \"Once you start asking\" by Marcus Voelter. He runs a podcast called Omega Tau, where he's interviewed scientists and engineers from these and many other \"megaprojects\".  http://omegataupodcast.net/once-you-start-asking/  The last one I'd point out is the idea of using the sun itself as a gravitational lense.

    "\n\nHuman: How to get over formula skepticism when learning physics? I\u2019m a 39yo person that really wants to learn physics. I\u2019ve read \u201cpopular science\u201d books all my life, and I\u2019ve watched an excessive amount of YoutTube videos about physics and quantum mechanics (my main interest). But I\u2019ve never been happy with the level of explanation I get, so I\u2019m trying to go down to the fundamentals. But I get mentally stuck whenever someone presents a formula that I\u2019m supposed to simply accept.  In my field of computer systems, it\u2019s straightforward and satisfying to set a goal of learning how something works, and being able to read books, do quick experiments and even read source code about how that one thing works.  In QM, I\u2019ve never found a satisfying \u201clearning loop\u201d and I\u2019d love to learn your thoughts.  For example, I\u2019d like to deeply understand lasers. I\u2019m fascinated by them and by the quantum effects that allow them to exist. But whenever I start digging in, I get stuck because understanding X requires understanding Y, which requires understanding a zillion other things. I\u2019m sure physics students must have had similar experiences, but what gives hope to continue studying? Will I ever understand anything?!  One particular challenge I have is learning QM via textbooks. They say things like:  \u201cAccording to classical electrodynamics, empty space containing electromagnetic radiation possesses energy. In fact, this radiant energy is responsible for the ability of a hollow cavity to absorb heat. In terms of the electric field, \u03b5(x, y, z, t), and the magnetic field, , the energy can be shown to be*: \u201d  And then they show a formula. But there\u2019s no explanation for that formula. The asterisk points to another book which probably has a proof. In practice people are expected to just keep reading, but that is deeply unsatisfying. It creates a huge mental block that I can\u2019t get over. Any tips for how to move on but still have a feeling that you understand things?  Thank you in advance\n\nAssistant:": {

I actually started to read them earlier this year to help refresh my memory before starting grad school and I've actually been surprised by how useful they were. I recommend them also because they're a lot shorter than trying to work your way through a textbook, so maybe a better starting point.",

            " Along with other proteins,ELASTIN in your skin is the main component keeping your skin (you guessed it elastic) and its existence depends on 2 things. The rate at which you synthesize elastin and the rate at which the enzymes that break it down do so, this balance can be disturbed by decreasing synthetic function or increasing breakdown and is affected by different factors..   1. age: younger cells are better at making things than older cells due to factors like oxidative stress and accumulation of mutations over time.  2. Nutritional status: you need to have enough of the necessary ingredients to make elastin 3. Exercise: our bodies respond well to stimuli that tell it to work, exercise keeps your synthetic function going as you replace damaged muscle fibers and your body stays on top of its synthetic function as it has a constant stimulus to do so.   4. Stress: being under a lot of stress induces release of cortisol, the stress response hormone, one of the well known effects of high levels of circulating cortisol is skin atrophy aka getting thin bad skin due to decreased synthesis of all the proteins in your skin (elastin and co.) 5. UV radiation; this bad boy damages the skin cells that carry out that synthetic function, so keeping you skin protected is a way to preserve these cells, this is why some people that apply daily sunscreen to their faces look way younger for their age. UV leads to decreased elastin synthesis.  6. Smoking : terrible one right here, this bad boy directly damages proteins that slow down the rate at which you break down elastin, so if you damage the thing stopping the breakdown of the good stuff (elastin) then you break down more elastin and you\u2019re left with once again.. less elastin 7. There\u2019s other factors but i need to stop writing eventually so i don\u2019t bore everyone to death. But i hope these helped.   In a nutshell, as with most other things, eat well, exercise, don\u2019t smoke, stay stress free !   hope this helps  Edit: structure, grammar, spelling."

It wasn't so much an event as it was part of an ongoing process that's always happening. We think that (basically) all the contents just keep breaking up, migrating around to the other side of the earth, smashing together to make a supercontinent, and then they brake up again and repeat the process.  We're still in that cycle now, the mid-Atlantic rift is constantly spreading the Americas and Europe/Africa farther apart. Meanwhile, the pacific is basically being eaten by Asia and the western coast of the Americas (this is why the \"ring of fire\" exists around the edge of the pacific). New York and London are centimetres farther apart from each other every year.   500 million years before Pangea existed there was an earlier supercontinent called Rodinia (and more before that). Hundreds of million of years in the future there will probably be another super content with China squished up against the Americas. The Atlantic will be a superocean!  The process is super slow - \"geological time\" - and, as others have said, nothing alive would notice except for maybe experiencing the occasional tectonically-related natural disaster (earthquakes, fisher eruptions). It wouldn't be like the continent splitting apart with a big crack. Garben and Half-Garben would form, the land would kind of slowly spread and sink (again, not on a time scale that living things would notice). Sediment would build up in the garbens and eventually the sea would encroach in the rift valleys (or, if inland, large lakes would form). The tectonic plates would truly split up, bit by bit, fissures would occur, and over time a mid ocean spreading ridge would develop (like the one in the middle of the atlantic).   The edges of tectonic plates aren't even all one long crack like you might imagine, they are actually kind of a bunch of little cracks connected by transform faults. It's all got to do with the geometry of the world being round. Even along the spreading centers, you would never see the \"crack\" itself, because loose sediment falls down and would cover it, like you can see in this picture. The most exciting thing that you would see at spreading centers would be hydrothermal vents and maybe some volcanic or fissure eruptions.   The East African Rift Valley is an active rift zone. East Africa is basically being ripped off (the African Plate is splitting in two, becoming the Somali Plate and the Nubian Plate). At some point in the future (in millions of years) the sea will start to fill in that valley. This is whole process is called the Wilson Cycle.   Iceland is (I think) the only place on earth where land sits directly over an active spreading center, they occasionally have fissure eruptions. Basically, volcanic eruptions that happen in a long line, a crack. They would probably be the most obvious sign of spreading that could be observed in a life time. But these are TINNY little eruptions compared to the size and thickness of a tectonic plate, little brakes caused by huge tectonic forces, little bursts of stress release along the area of the spreading center.  I should say that tectonics is actually pretty new, the theory was only accepted in the 60s. Why tectonic pates do what they do and just how they do it is something that geologists are still learning about.  Edits: So many for words and stuff, and for Iceland. Thanks for the gold!",

That night my friend had her husband take a look to see if anything looked infected. They immediatly called the midwife.

Wound healing occurs only in the presence of adequate oxygenation, blood supply, and lack of a foreign body/infection.

    "\n\nHuman: AskScience AMA Series: Hi! I am Prof. Nadav Davidovitch, an epidemiologist and one of the architects of Israel's coronavirus response and vaccine operation. Ask me anything! Hi! I am Prof. Nadav Davidovitch, an epidemiologist, public health physician, professor, and director of the School of Public Health at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU). I study health policy, vaccination policy, comparative health care systems, public health ethics and global health. During the pandemic, it has been my  honor to serve on Israel's national COVID-19 advisory committee, as well as on the COVID-19 Task Force of the Association of Schools of Public Health in the European Region.  My research focuses on various aspects of health policy, combining my multidisciplinary experience as an epidemiologist and public health physician with my knowledge of the sociology of health and public health ethics. I am involved in several projects related to legal and ethical aspects of public health practices, including pandemic response and health inequalities.  As a reserve medical officer during 2014's Operation Protective Edge, I was the commander of a medical unit of 700 physicians, paramedics, medics, and other medical personnel. I received my M.D. and Ph.D. from Tel Aviv University and my M.P.H. from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.  I have authored or co-authored over 150 papers and book chapters, coedited 5 volumes and books and published work in leading medical and health policy journals, such as the New England Journal of Medicine, Clinical Infectious Diseases, Emerging Infectious Diseases, Journal of Pediatrics, Vaccine, Social Science and Medicine, and Law & Contemporary Problems.

    "\n\nHuman: [DC/Marvel/General] Why is oversight something that sits so poorly with most superheroes? Nearly every time, whenever someone brings up the idea of checks and balances for superheroes like the Justice League, Avengers, and so on, they always treat it as a totally negative thing that no good will come from. The League in particular was absolutely disgusted at the thought of being kept in check via contingencies should they act out of sorts, either voluntarily or via brainwashing, something that happens nearly all the time. They seem wholly convinced that they're above the law, that they're perfect people who can do absolutely no wrong and the idea that they need to be kept in line so they don't abuse their powers is something they find utterly insulting, or even a sign of ingratitude for their services.  What's up with that?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " They trust their own judgment more than the people who would be overseeing them. Steve Rogers said it best in Civil War:  >\"If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose.

            " Had Batman decided to work within the system when he first came back to Gotham he would have his hands tied by the corruption of that system as much as Gordon always had.   The idea of working within the law and having oversight is great until it turns out that oversight is corrupt or worse. The Red Skull has infiltrated the US Senate. Lex Luthor has become President. Who would the superheroes be answering to in these situations? In The Boys the Supes have \u201coversight\u201d in the form of our government and corporate institutions, is that working out well? How much trust would you expect people to put in institutions so susceptible to corruption and personal greed?   The Suicide Squad is a sanctioned government task force, does that sound like the kind of government you would give oversight over your activities to if you\u2019re Wonder Woman?   Not to mention the bureaucracy, when Darkseid is attacking Earth, should the Justice League wait for approval to go stop him? Remember that Darkseid had agents all throughout Earth. G. Gordon Godfrey, one of the most vocal proponents of what you\u2019re asking was secretly his minister of propaganda in disguise sowing discord against super humans.   In the MCU when Thanos was attacking Earth and it was all hands on deck to try and stop him. Captain America and his allies showed up to help the fight, and what did  the man who represented government oversight, General Ross, immediately order War Machine to do? Arrest him and the others.   And I think most clearly illustrating the point, in Iron Man 2 Senator Stern demanded Tony Stark hand over the Iron Man armor to the US government. And well, I think we all know to what organization the good senator\u2019s allegiances truly lied.",

            " If I got things right, the big problem seems to be that whoever would control them and keep them in check is  1. absolutely useless if the heroes actually do cross the line and  2. even more prone to do so.  Think about it - who would control the League or Avengers in these cases? The governments of the Earth, or more specifically that of the US since that's where they are often based.  Not only would they be utterly unable to do anything against many of the powered heroes if they go rogue (What are they gonna do, *arrest* Thor and Superman? Fine the Hulk?), but they are almost always at least partially incompetent and corrupt. And this is without going into real life politics, especially that of recent times - the MCU's government was shown to be partially part of an ancient Nazi organization. Some politicians may be Skrulls, or evil clones, or Doombots, or Lexbots, or bought by the Penguin/Kingpin, or any other number of corrupt or replaced or just down right evil person or being. Lex Luthor became president of the US more than once.  This would also make the politicians that *aren't* awful even more of a target for villains and criminals than before - if someone controls what the Avengers can do, and that person is just a squishy politician, it's hilariously easy to make them actively disrupt Avengers operations. Take their family hostage, brain wash them, kill them and replace them if all else fails. Ez pz.  It would also involve a ton of bureaucracy, which is not just annoyingly infuriating and infuriatingly annoying when you're trying to help people but also takes *time* - time that could be spent helping people.  Worth mentioning is also that many heroes just don't agree with the views of whoever would \"keep them in check\". Look at Black Widow, the Punisher, the Question, Bucky, Hulk, some Wonder Women, Rorschach, etc.. Governments have failed them before or aren't extreme enough in how they handle things, so this would just be an annoyance that would get in the way.  Not to mention that some heroes are also just kind of...above local governments? Or at least feel like it. Thor is a prince or King, not to mention a literal god. Black Panther, Namor, Black Bolt and Aquaman are almost always Kings of their country/city. Wonder Woman is made by a god and the daughter of Themyscira's ruler, if I remember right. Why would any of them listen to a couple old idiots in suits discussing their actions in Washington?",
            " They're vigilantes. If they were okay with oversight, they'd be working for the government, not hiding behind masks  (Yes, all superhero fiction has fascist undertones. Yes, that is one of the major themes and points being made in the Watchmen comic)",
            " Batman's contingencies are *not* oversight- they're exactly the kind of unaccountable powers in one person's hand that oversight is meant to avoid. After all, if *Batman* makes a mistake, acts rashly or is himself controlled, he might single-handedly wipe out earths defense and indirectly destroy humanity with no-one else able to intervene or even aware a choice is being made.  The League are fine with accountability and oversight, as are most DC heroes. They've stood down at the bequest of states, they've owned up to and in elseworlds resigned after serious errors, they even seem grudgingly ok with the *government* making contingencies against them.  What they're *not* fine with is one dude making a private \"destroy the justice league\" machine he can turn on any time he likes based on only his own judgement, and I think that's a pretty reasonable stance.  Meanwhile, say what you will about Civil War of either comic or film, one cannot accuse the avengers of having one monolithic stance on regulation. This is the trend in the Marvel universe- superhero oversight is a highly contreverisal topic. There's no one opinion in the heroic community: some think it's 100% evil, some think it's 100% the right thing to do, some have varying opinions inbetween. It's a fairly realistic spread of opinions."

            " I'd like to apologize in advance, as it's been a long, *long* time since I've played the first Max Payne, so my recollection may be off. That said, there's quite a few elements to cover here, so let's get started!  >He's just a cop.  He *was* just a cop, a detective, up until his then-rudimentary training and work experience was put to the test during the home invasion that had tragically claimed the lives of his wife and child. Had a group with a little more cohesion and clarity of mind been sent in to clean up, we'd be closing the record book with the entire Payne family in body bags.  But, we didn't, because Payne walked out of that house alive and breathing, his life taken without actually having died.  On that day, Max stopped being *\"just a cop\"* and took up an offer from close friend and co-worker Alex, who got Max into a pretty tough undercover investigative program. That doesn't just require training to survive the bunch of sharks he'd be calling colleagues, it required Max to learn from those very same thugs and lowlifes, which is actually a pretty diverse range of histories and experiences. It's not common, but one of such histories is that of ex-soldiers, the sort who have survived not only whatever third world country they'd been shipped off to, but also the streets of the urban jungle, where making a mistake can have horrific results. No doubt one or two criminals Max had to affiliate with while undercover, would insist that he be a bit smarter about how he handles himself in a fight.  He wasn't at the same level as the Aesir Contractors by then, but he was pretty darn close.  Things really began to lean in Max's favor when the bank robbery at the subway station got Max's cover blown. Suddenly he found himself using what he'd learned from both worlds to gun down people he'd been watching *Lord's and Ladies* with not but a few hours ago, giving him a chance to cement everything he'd learned against a population that would be challenging but not beyond his level. The lessons of who knows how many ex-military on top of what he'd learned to become an undercover element, gave him a much needed edge to survive the events throughout, with each notch on the scoreboard being a little more experience on top of what he already knew.  It wouldn't be just criminals either. With corporate hands in the mix and government ties, Max would end up facing some pretty serious hombres, with his then-biggest rival Punchinello being little more than a corporate puppet with serious Gusto. But worse, a chunk of these guys were also something more, a growing population of persons with poor impulse control hopped up on an experimental drug that would become known on the streets only as Valkyr. These people saw themselves as fearless gods, capable of charging through gunfire if even for only a second, instilling terror enough that when the Punchinello family was out of the picture, the police soon found their positions besieged so fiercely that even trained SWAT teams were overrun.  There wasn't any logic behind the thoughts of those driven by Valkyr, just blind rage and a drive to kill. For the SWAT teams and anyone else caught in the swirl of a power vacuum that was the fall of the Punchinello family, it was a brand new and horrific rash of violence that nobody could be prepared for. For Max? It was a numbed experience, as the shock of seeing Valkyr at work had worn off long ago when he'd learned of the stuff during his undercover involvement with Punchinello and his lot, who were one of the main suppliers of the substance.   >He's just a cop.  He **was** just a cop, but as he began moving and killing the lower tier trash mobs that were average criminals and former \"business\" acquaintances, a lot of folks forget that he wasn't the *only* cop, or the *only* person impacted by his actions. When the bank robbery failed, Punchinello was in a bit of trouble; a potential source of possibly much needed revenue possibly promised to supposedly really bad suppliers had just landed in the lap of the police, and a *lot* of dead bodies with ties to Punchinello had also been recovered at the scene. Worse, it was a two-bit undercover cop that busted the whole thing.  Punchinello was in over his head, and the Russians were already nipping at his sensitive spots. By this point Max had not just given every other criminal entity in the city a *massive* amount of momentum against Punchinello's organization, Punchinello's attempts to resecure power began to crumble with the death of Lupino and numerous other lieutenants, and outright failed when Punchinello got a visit from Payne himself.  Punchinello had obligations, supply lines of guns, drugs, and Valkyr that he needed to ensure the safety of, and Max's disruptions meant *all* of those were at risk, so to preemptively counter any pushes from he Russians and other smaller players on the city, he diverted manpower to fight off any opportunistic pushes, which meant keeping his own self surrounded by whatever he had left.  As we know, his delusions were more than enough to convince him that was all he needed, when he absolutely needed more.  >He's just a cop.  When word got out that Punchinello was dead and his assets up for grabs, the city practically *exploded* with violence. On top of an already bad snow storm, the police were fighting a losing battle as every thug in the street began fighting for a piece of the drug empire pie.  But they weren't the only ones.  A few calls from sources inside the police department were more than enough for Aesir to realize that their largest trafficker of Valkyr had just been stopped dead. Not knowing the full extent of who was responsible or why they'd done it, Aesir sent instructions to their connections in local law enforcement, only to be told that anyone who could carry out those instructions were busy fighting a losing battle in the streets or already dead.  When you've got cell phones and ledgers with Aesir names on them lying in the crumbling remains of an impending FBI investigation in the middle of the biggest crisis to hit national television in years, being told *\"We can't help\"* doesn't sound like a good answer. So Aesir sent their own, some private security types to clean up what they could find and get the Aesir name far and away from the chaos that was unfolding, only to never hear from said contractors again. It wasn't that they were being found and killed by Max, so much as they just couldn't get to the evidence alive or in time.

When looking at a map of the Middle East, you can practically draw a U shape from Hezbollah in Lebanon, down to Al-Qaeda cells in Saudi Arabia and Yemen--though generally skipping the rich Arabian/Persian Gulf states--then skip over to Afghanistan and Pakistan, where insurgent activity is practically headquartered. However, Iran is pretty much never mentioned in the context of 'terrorism' as we know commonly know it, only nuclear weapon production. I know Iranian literally means Aryan, and thus they are ethnically different from Arabs, but then again, aren't the people in Afghanistan and Pakistan non-Arab as well--in fact I believe they are considered Aryan since Aryans having centuries passed swooped down the Khyber Pass from modern day Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan into the northern India/Pakistan area, along with some people from modern day Iran (the Persians) (if I remember my history correctly).

This one is up late but next week it should be all automated.  TODAY:   This is for social science related outpourings that are not necessarily questions.  Minor questions that you feel don't need or merit their own threads are welcome too. Discovered a great new book, documentary, article or blog? Has your Ph.D. application been successful? Have you made an sociological discovery while at the supermarket? Did you find an anecdote about Milton Freedman telling a joke to B. F. Skinner? Tell us all about it.  Moderation in this thread will be relatively non-existent -- jokes, anecdotes and light-hearted banter are welcome.  *Previously in this series*:  Monday Reading and Research: focusing on exactly that: the social science you have been reading this week and the research you've been working on.

The experiment was called off early and its methods have never been evaluated in any kind of official capacity (i.e., the Stanford Prison Experiment has never undergone peer review of any kind).  Basically, the thing is a huge mess of an experiment that makes for an interesting anecdote but should not be treated as a valid study.",

            " I think Governments are typically more preoccupied with economic growth, as economic growth is an indicator of good governance and social progress as growth is caused by a large range of factors including technological innovation. Population growth results in a degree of economic growth but governments usually try to limit rampant growth(see China's one child policy or India's sterilization policy under Indhira Gandhi). In places with shrinking populations economic growth is structurally hampered by a market that is shrinking and a smaller labor force.",
            " In abstract terms, economic growth is not unsustainable (population growth probably is)\u2014of course, this will depend on what we define as economic growth.   A more direct question would necessarily revolve around the nature of capitalism. Can the logic of capital accumulation provide the basis for a sustainable world? As we have seen throughout modern history, capital seeks out new markets, transforming previously unmarketable goods into commodities. This includes many things, from health services, to ideas, to water, to complex financial instruments. In other words, there is an expansion of 'places' (markets) in which commodities can be bought and sold, places where 'things' are transformed into commodities that can be privately and exclusively owned, either by individuals or fictitious individuals, such as the corporation. In this process, capital (as a set of social relations) seeks to 'privatize' or commoditize everything and anything so as to produce more capital. There are setbacks to be sure\u2014the welfare state is a good example\u2014based on political and economic conditions, the balance of class power, and other factors, but on the whole the trajectory is toward more and more capital accumulation, and thus, greater centralization of capital in what we now call transnational corporations.  Given the general nature of this logic, the trajectory is toward a fairly dystopian world where everything (and I mean everything) is bought and sold, subject to market forces. This is, of course, a hypothetical situation in which contingency plays no part\u2014and as we know, historical events are nothing if not incredibly contingent, and in some cases, contradictory to our understanding of development.   By itself, the nature and logic of capital accumulation seems unsustainable in the long run without destroying the planet and pushing the majority of the world's subordinate classes into further poverty, with less control of their political economic futures. Of course, that in itself is unsustainable, and thus, as we move from crisis to crisis we see different popular reactions and counter-movements (e.g., the Quebec student strike, Occupy, etc.). So while capital accumulation is likely unsustainable, I do not think it is impossible to have a world in which 'economic growth' is sustainable, but this would need to be an economic growth based not merely on profit for individuals\u2014fictitious or otherwise\u2014but rather, those who create social wealth in the first place.  That is my personal view on the matter, but in answer to your question of why governments are obsessed with 'growth' you could take a number of different approaches.

        "sft_target": " In abstract terms, economic growth is not unsustainable (population growth probably is)\u2014of course, this will depend on what we define as economic growth.   A more direct question would necessarily revolve around the nature of capitalism. Can the logic of capital accumulation provide the basis for a sustainable world? As we have seen throughout modern history, capital seeks out new markets, transforming previously unmarketable goods into commodities. This includes many things, from health services, to ideas, to water, to complex financial instruments. In other words, there is an expansion of 'places' (markets) in which commodities can be bought and sold, places where 'things' are transformed into commodities that can be privately and exclusively owned, either by individuals or fictitious individuals, such as the corporation. In this process, capital (as a set of social relations) seeks to 'privatize' or commoditize everything and anything so as to produce more capital. There are setbacks to be sure\u2014the welfare state is a good example\u2014based on political and economic conditions, the balance of class power, and other factors, but on the whole the trajectory is toward more and more capital accumulation, and thus, greater centralization of capital in what we now call transnational corporations.  Given the general nature of this logic, the trajectory is toward a fairly dystopian world where everything (and I mean everything) is bought and sold, subject to market forces. This is, of course, a hypothetical situation in which contingency plays no part\u2014and as we know, historical events are nothing if not incredibly contingent, and in some cases, contradictory to our understanding of development.   By itself, the nature and logic of capital accumulation seems unsustainable in the long run without destroying the planet and pushing the majority of the world's subordinate classes into further poverty, with less control of their political economic futures. Of course, that in itself is unsustainable, and thus, as we move from crisis to crisis we see different popular reactions and counter-movements (e.g., the Quebec student strike, Occupy, etc.). So while capital accumulation is likely unsustainable, I do not think it is impossible to have a world in which 'economic growth' is sustainable, but this would need to be an economic growth based not merely on profit for individuals\u2014fictitious or otherwise\u2014but rather, those who create social wealth in the first place.  That is my personal view on the matter, but in answer to your question of why governments are obsessed with 'growth' you could take a number of different approaches. Using a Foucauldian lens, you might ask where our fascination for 'growth' came from, examining texts and archives, etc., to determine the genealogy of the concept (more so, in the sense of what Foucault might call a particular governmentality of growth).  You could also take a Marxian-influenced perspective that examines the role of the state. The state (and government) cannot be viewed as independent actors.

        "rejected_target": " I think Governments are typically more preoccupied with economic growth, as economic growth is an indicator of good governance and social progress as growth is caused by a large range of factors including technological innovation. Population growth results in a degree of economic growth but governments usually try to limit rampant growth(see China's one child policy or India's sterilization policy under Indhira Gandhi). In places with shrinking populations economic growth is structurally hampered by a market that is shrinking and a smaller labor force."

This is what lead to their Social Dominance Theory.  Essentially **The worst outcomes in a society will generally be held by outgroup men--out-grouped usually in terms of their race--as opposed to outgroup women.** The combination of outgroup male's maleness and minority status makes the in-group perceive them as more of a threat than their female counterparts, leading to more discrimination in job hiring, the criminal justice system, education, risk of homelessness, child mortality, etc.  This is in contrast with the popular \"Double Jeopardy\" theory, which holds that minority women have to bear the burden of both racism and sexism, while their male counterparts have the \"privilege\" of only having to deal with the former. The empirical, survey, and archival evidence used by Sidanius and co. shows that in actuality, the Womanhood of minority women in many ways *prevents* them from receiving as much discrimination and poorer outcomes as their male counterparts.  For example, black women are sentenced more leniently than even white men--and at about the same as white women. As I'm sure we all know, black men aren't so lucky.  In the famous 2005 Bertrand and Mullainthan study \"Are Emily and Greg more employable than Lakisha and Jamal?\" which studied labor market discrimination, it was found that applications with white-sounding names were much more likely to receive a callback than those with black-sounding ones. Not really surprising. What was interesting, was that applications with Black *female* sounding names had a significantly higher callback rate than equally-credentialed applications with Black *male* names. For whatever reason, *Lakisha was seen as being more employable than Jamal, even though Jamal should have supposedly had an advantage over her because of his maleness.* I guess you could just look at this discrepancy in terms of filling diversity quotas: Lakisha checks off two boxes, Jamal only checks off one.  Evidence like this supports one of the implications of Social Dominace theory, which is that *intersectionality is not additive*, meaning that you can't just assign a positive or negative value to a set of group classifications (+1 for white, male, heterosexual, etc.; -1 for non-white, female, non-hetero, etc.) and whoever ends up with the highest score is the most privileged in any situation, and the lowest is the least. Although black males would \"score higher\" than black females in this system, the real-world data doesn't reflect this.   TL;DR: Minority males will be both the primary perpetrators and victims of arbitrary-set discrimination (the arbitrary set being their race/ethnicity). Minority men will be treated like minority men; minority women will mostly be treated like...women. If things improve for women, things will improve for minority women. It's a whole different story for minority males.   Sidanius did a short lecture going through all this a few years ago prior to his death. I'd highly recommend that you watch all of it to understand the underlying framework of the theory--and look into his work in more depth--but the discrepancies that you asked about are addressed starting at 21:49.

Additional direct cost savings might come from prenatal care, which they estimate could range from a $2.50 to $7 cost savings for each dollar invested in the program.

So these numbers reflect a VERY small sample population compared to a larger geographical area or a higher participation rate, and are probably conservative even for this small sample size.   Whether these numbers are directly applicable to a larger population is a bit unclear; for example, as they point out, costs vary widely depending on the ease of the birth, and the age of the parent is directly correlated with this (for example, minors are more likely to have babies of low birthweight, with commensurately high costs as mentioned above). However, most likely they're at least in the ballpark.

In that case, I highly recommend you read the source of the contraceptive mandate idea, a report from the Institutes of Medicine that attempted to outline what the best preventive practices for women are from both a health and cost-effectiveness standpoint. You can read the report online here.  In brief, you can see here that access to contraception is part of a broader package of women's health. The benefits are manifold - proper family planning allows women to better plan their careers and other major lifestyle decisions (economic benefit); put more space between their pregnancies, which has been shown to lead to better outcomes for children; and reduce the rate of unintended pregnancies: currently, ~49% of pregnancies in America are unintended, and I'm sure you can imagine the negative consequences of that figure, which is much higher than other developed countries.

Fluke (the person criticized by Rush Limbaugh) discussed a friend with polycystic ovarian syndrome, or PCOS, who had multiple cysts in her ovaries, but was denied the coverage of birth control pills, even though her physician specifically noted she needed them to manage PCOS. This is a common, off-label use. Ironically, she could not afford the much higher price of the pills without coverage, and developed a massive cyst - and lost one of her ovaries. It's possible she may not be able to have a child at all, as a result.   I've had two ruptured ovarian cysts. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would unabashedly rank them as \"11\" (sorry, Nigel). You feel like your guts are tearing apart from within. Needless to say on both occasions I had to leave the workplace and was unable to return immediately, and I was one of the many lucky women who did not develop an infection or have a more serious cyst rupture.   I cannot imagine the pain and suffering of someone whose ovaries are constantly producing cysts - but I can confirm that she is unable to function at her best in her workplace. With key members of various work teams potentially unable to control their health problems in safe, effective ways, this could have a ripple effect in many workplaces."

    "\n\nHuman: Is there a name for this phenomenon I've noticed, where people can't accept two different things with the same name? (x-post r/answers) I realize that title made little to no sense, so let me explain:  I seem to have noticed this new-fangled logical fallacy where people think that a cheaper, less-authentic version of something somehow ruins the more-legitimate version.  You see it a lot with pizza. Someone will say, \"ugh, dominos? Haven't you had *real* New York pizza/Italian pizza/Chicago pizza?\"  This argument is weird, and it incorrectly assumes 2 things:  1) That dominos is desperately trying to re-create authentic NY/Italian/Chicago pizza (and failing).  and  2) Because of this, dominos is now awful and can't be enjoyed.   Thing is, dominos isn't *trying* to be authentic. It's just trying to sell a different kind of food completely. But, because Italians Pizza and Dominos pizza are both called \"pizza,\" people flip out. If dominos were just called \"Tomato and Cheese bread,\" less people would probably experience this phenomenon.  And, it isn't just pizza.  You can love Dogfish Head IPA and still appreciate that budweiser maybe has it's place (as something completely different). You can be a film connoisseur and still appreciate that Michael Bay films are mindless summer blockbusters (and being a mindless summer blockbuster doesn't somehow offend other films).   And again, you can love amazing New York/Chicago/Italian pizza, and still know that dominos is something else completely, and still has it's own merits.  Me? I live in Taiwan and eat (IMHO) the best Chinese food in the world. When I go back to the states, I eat Panda Express. It's delicious. I don't sit around going, \"wow, I had sesame chicken in Hong Kong and... ugggghh this is *sooooooo* wrong.\" Panda Express isn't trying to be HK -- Panda Express is trying to sell delicious cheap food from a trough. I imagine if Panda Express just called itself \"Jimmy's Fried Chicken Bits w/ Rice\" or something, people wouldn't whine about how \"inauthentic\" is it.  People automatically assume that inauthentic things are worse, when in reality, the shift was usually hugely intentional (and doesn't necessarily say anything about the quality of said product).  To me, this is a logical fallacy. Has it ever been labelled or named?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " It's...a lot of factors. The short answer is, the socioeconomic status of blacks in America, combined with the re-segregation of the US school system and the use of exclusionary disciplinary practices that create a \"push out\" problem.  I don't have an advanced degree in the subject, so I apologize in advance for any vagueness of mistakes. I'll do the best to synthesize what I've learned so far.  First let's get into the details. To say that **all** blacks in America have a high drop-out rate is a serious oversimplification. Drop-out rates vary by income level; poor whites, blacks, Latinos, Asians, and any other subgroup you can find will all have high dropout rates that decease as income increases. Similarly, dropout rates vary by region type. Suburban schools tend to have low dropout rates, urban schools tend to have high dropout rates, and rural schools tend to be in the middle.  Remember that up until very recently in US history, schools systems were segregated, and not just in the south. Because most cities and states couldn't care less about the quality of education non-white students received, these schools were often very low-quality, especially in areas with the most virulent racism (again, not just in the south.)  So as you probably know, the civil rights movement happened, and was successful in ensuring legal rights for all students to gain aces to formerly all-white schools free from discrimination based on race, through such case as Brown v. Board of Education. But this was only true on paper, in reality it took decades to actually implement desegregation schools, mostly because the same Supreme Court that ruled segregated schools as unconstitutional gave up authority for integration to the same state governments that had created those segregated schools.   Whites did everything possible to prevent blacks from gaining equitable access to the school system. They used the \"massive resistance\" doctrine that was epitomized by Little Rock (\"Segregation now, segregation forever\"), and after Brown v. Board of Education, delay tactics (\"You can't just rush these things, people will get too upset, we need more time...\") and tokenism (\"Of course our school is integrated, we have a whole 10 black students out of 3,000!\"), as well as outright violence and intimidation. Source But when all of that failed after years or decades of legal pressure and activism, the response of whites was frequently to leave the cities for the suburbs, the phenomena known as White Flight. As whites abandoned the inner city, attention of media and policymakers left as well.  The result is the **re-segregation** of the US public school system, in which urban school schools, which are disproportionately composed of poor people of color receive far less funding and attention, in contrast to white suburban schools. Overview Remember that even with federal and state funding, local governments provide the backbone for schools. Since local governments receive their funding from property taxes, lots of poor people concentrated in a school district translates to a shortage of money where it is needed the most.  These inner-city schools have also seen a dramatic rise in **exclusionary disciplinary practices** such as detentions, suspensions, and expulsions. As crime and poverty increased in the inner city, conservatives often accounted it to a lack of morality by poor people of colon, and supported these practices to \"get tough\" on crime, juvenile delinquency, and school violence.

            " It's...a lot of factors. The short answer is, the socioeconomic status of blacks in America, combined with the re-segregation of the US school system and the use of exclusionary disciplinary practices that create a \"push out\" problem.  I don't have an advanced degree in the subject, so I apologize in advance for any vagueness of mistakes. I'll do the best to synthesize what I've learned so far.  First let's get into the details. To say that **all** blacks in America have a high drop-out rate is a serious oversimplification. Drop-out rates vary by income level; poor whites, blacks, Latinos, Asians, and any other subgroup you can find will all have high dropout rates that decease as income increases. Similarly, dropout rates vary by region type. Suburban schools tend to have low dropout rates, urban schools tend to have high dropout rates, and rural schools tend to be in the middle.  Remember that up until very recently in US history, schools systems were segregated, and not just in the south. Because most cities and states couldn't care less about the quality of education non-white students received, these schools were often very low-quality, especially in areas with the most virulent racism (again, not just in the south.)  So as you probably know, the civil rights movement happened, and was successful in ensuring legal rights for all students to gain aces to formerly all-white schools free from discrimination based on race, through such case as Brown v. Board of Education. But this was only true on paper, in reality it took decades to actually implement desegregation schools, mostly because the same Supreme Court that ruled segregated schools as unconstitutional gave up authority for integration to the same state governments that had created those segregated schools.   Whites did everything possible to prevent blacks from gaining equitable access to the school system. They used the \"massive resistance\" doctrine that was epitomized by Little Rock (\"Segregation now, segregation forever\"), and after Brown v. Board of Education, delay tactics (\"You can't just rush these things, people will get too upset, we need more time...\") and tokenism (\"Of course our school is integrated, we have a whole 10 black students out of 3,000!\"), as well as outright violence and intimidation. Source But when all of that failed after years or decades of legal pressure and activism, the response of whites was frequently to leave the cities for the suburbs, the phenomena known as White Flight. As whites abandoned the inner city, attention of media and policymakers left as well.  The result is the **re-segregation** of the US public school system, in which urban school schools, which are disproportionately composed of poor people of color receive far less funding and attention, in contrast to white suburban schools. Overview Remember that even with federal and state funding, local governments provide the backbone for schools. Since local governments receive their funding from property taxes, lots of poor people concentrated in a school district translates to a shortage of money where it is needed the most.  These inner-city schools have also seen a dramatic rise in **exclusionary disciplinary practices** such as detentions, suspensions, and expulsions. As crime and poverty increased in the inner city, conservatives often accounted it to a lack of morality by poor people of colon, and supported these practices to \"get tough\" on crime, juvenile delinquency, and school violence. Exclusionary disciplinary practices by definition take a student out of class, prevent them from learning, and frequently kick them out of school altogether. Numerous studies have documented that students of color are dramatically more likely to be punished in this way than white students, even for the same infraction. **Zero tolerance policies** are particularly unbalanced in this way.

            " I'm a high school English teacher in an inner city school in CA. There are lots of reasons for this and we shouldn't generalize, of course, so these are some reasons I have observed first hand (in my very short career thus far)  - lack of resources-- better neighborhoods receive more money and have more fundraising resources and those communities are financially able to pass special taxes that go directly to their schools - schools that perform below standards actually get $ taken away from them... Not logical - inner city schools cannot attract great teachers due to low wages, poor conditions, no support, etc. - inner city schools also have inefficient hiring practices-- they wait until the last minute to hire people - teachers do not make education relevant in student's lives. I'm a big believer in good parenting which to me means \"don't slack in school son/ daughter,\" but teachers need to make school relevant. Reading nothing but Shakespeare (I'm exaggerating) in English is not the way to do this. I'm a newish teacher and am trying to change this at my school-- I've hit several brick walls - and instant gratification attitude-- if you know you can make a lot of money drug dealing or other crimes, why would you waste your time in school/ college when you can get the money and things you want quick and easy by breaking the law.  I consider myself a good teacher-- I actively pursued employment in an inner city school because I wanted to change the status quo. If only a little bit.  Edit: formatting",

            " >Is there a proven capitalistic model that would sustain inequality-controlled living conditions without population growth, while consuming only renewable (or otherwise practically unlimited) resources?  I think nearly everyone--supporters and detractors of capitalism--would agree that there is no *proven* model, but supporters of capitalism would probably object to the notion that any such model could be proven in advance rather than develop on its own.  *Capital in the Twenty-First Century* by Thomas Piketty argues that the tendency towards increases in inequality is an inherent law of capitalist modes of economy, but that (global) regulation can stem this tendency.  Marxists obviously reject the possibility of regulation having such ability and would likely argue any regulation would be captured by the logic of capitalist accumulation. Of course what the alternative would be is always an issue and debates within Marxism range from the abolishment of all hierarchal institutions (including the family) to a focus on renewing the commons and creating community-based economies. See everything ranging from *Commonwealth* to *Take Back the Economy* to *Rebel Cities* to *Magical Marxism*.   Piketty notably doesn't analyze issues of climate change, resource depletion, pollution, ect in real depth (he acknowledges them as really important issues, though). Piketty does implicitly seem to believe that perpetual growth is possible. Many Marxists are also guilty of not considering the limits the natural world might place on the economic and underestimate the potential for radical and dramatic changes in the Earth-system--*Molecular Red* by Ken Wark gives a good overview of this. Though some Marxists are trying to rectify this--see Jason Moore's *Capital in the Web of Life*.  Of course there are also the proponents of capitalism--or market economies, as many would likely say--who believe that capitalism is the best system to stay with to address inequality and environmental issues. The list here is long, but an interesting take on this could be found in the developers of the emerging 'Good Anthropocene' argument--which argues that rather being a negative, humans capacity to transform the planetary-system should be seen as the opportunity to change the Earth to meet our desires.   So, the short answer is: there is no proven model--capitalist or otherwise--but there is a lot of debate and theorization.",

I couldn't think of another way to phrase the question. And I apologize if this post doesn't belong in this sub.  Basically, I think that as soon as we start teaching kids about sex ed. we should teach or at least introduce some of the things that are discussed in parenting classes (for context - I have never been to any parenting classes and the search I did online as to what actually defines 'parenting classes' turned up nothing). I feel that insight into what it takes to care for a child would help reduce the number of children who become abused/neglected.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: How to get rid of these damn fleas on our cats? Our indoor cats got fleas presumably when we cat sat for a friend. It's not something we have ever dealt with before and didn't realize it was fleas until about 4 months afterwards and they were infested. We've given them 3 months of advantage II flea treatment; washed with hot water and hot dryer the blankets they sleep on all the time; vacuum regularly; Removed and washed the carpet they would sit on soaking wet with dawn (it's rolled up away right now). The advantage helps for a few weeks but then they're back itching and scabs again after 2 or 3 weeks from the treatment. What else can I be doing to get rid of these damn fleas once and for all?

The flea life cycle on average is 3 months, so you will need a prescription strength preventative monthly for at least that amount of time. Vacuuming daily (focusing on areas that are carpeted/where the cat spends the most time) and make sure you are emptying the canister after each cleaning outside, so you are not dropping more eggs back into the environment. It's easier if you can quarantine the cat to a single room of the house, and vacuum/clean/launder all possible items until things are under control (1 month to kill current fleas, but continue for 2-3 months to kill other life stages).  Everything we have to kill fleas will only kill the adults/larva, not the eggs. The eggs are very hardy and can only be killed with heat (dryer cycle/steam cleaning). So you have to wait/continue to clean until all the eggs hatch.   Don't use anything over the counter that is Hartz brand for a cat.",

            " Many things can cause this, while it doesn't happen often I will say that sudden death under anesthesia is probably more common in veterinary medicine for a variety of reasons. From lack of regulation leading to variable standards of care, to our lesser ability to know what's going on with our patients (they can't talk etc). Even if your veterinarian did do preanesthetic bloodwork and a full physical which is standard of care, it's still possible your pet had an underlying condition which was undetected through no fault of the doctor. It's impossible for us to say without knowing more.   You could discuss a necropsy with your veterinarian as someone else mentioned (time sensitive & you may or may not get an answer). I would absolutely ask to meet/zoom with them to discuss what happened in more detail so you can get some closure. It's totally normal to have questions and want to discuss this further.

    "\n\nHuman: My dog is at the ER. They said she ingested cannabis, benzos, and opiods TL; dr   My dog has tested positive for drugs that I do not have.  I am certain she did not get into my medication.  How is this possible?   \u2022 Species: dog   \u2022 Age: 15 months   \u2022 Sex/Neuter status: f/neutered    \u2022 Breed: mostly BT with a splash of chihuahua    \u2022 Body weight: 18lbs   \u2022 History:    \u2022 Clinical signs: wobbly and vomited    \u2022 Duration: 2 hours ago (7pm Pacific time)   \u2022 Your general location: west coast of canada    My dog got into something today - she was chewing on something and I reached in her mouth and pulled out some of my hair and figured that was it.  That was 5 hours ago.    2 hours ago she vomited a yellowish/orange liquid with a piece of paper (I'm assuming this was from an old joint she may have found behind the couch).  Then she got very unstable.    She has a caged in play area and I take her out to interact with her. I did this 5 hours ago as mentioned above.    After she vomited my partner tried to feed her and she refused.  I took her put of her play area to see how she would react in a bigger area.  She wanted to play but was obviously unstable. So we took her to the Er vet and told them we think she ate a roach.  They did a urine drug test and it came back positive for canabis, opiods and benzodiazepines.  They said she could not hold her bladder (due to covid we had to wait in the parking lot).  She didn't have any accidents at our home or in the car.   The only cannabis I smoke is from our government stores (legal in Canada) and it IS possible she found a roach that was missed but I vaccuum every day and try to keep the floor free of anything she could eat.  I do not take opiods and am very careful with my people medication and am certain I did not drop a pill.   They are keeping my dog over night for fluid treatment.  They are saying it was my medication but I am 99.9 percent certain that there is a mistake.    Full disclosure: she did ingest a pill I dropped late last year and that was 100% my fault.  I no longer take that medication.  I count every pill I take when I take them out of the package and as I ingest them.  I am very careful.    Can these tests be wrong?  The doctor said I must be buying drugs that are laced - but I buy them directly from the government.  I don't see a situation where she would have gotten one of my pills as I learned a very painful lesson when I made that mistake before.    How accurate are these tests?  Is there something else I should be looking for?  I want to keep her safe and my partner says she should stay in her play area rather then be out in the living area with us.    He does not want to take her for walks because she could get hurt.  He does not want her to be outside her play area because she could get hurt.  I think the isolation is bad for her and that she needs more exercise but he is afraid she will get hurt.    I love my little girl and am very scared.  I do not believe she got into my medication.  Am I missing something?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " ## DRUG SCREENING: RAPID TEST KITS VS GC/MS AND LC/MS/MS  I develop validated, multi-drug screening test methods for use by clinical toxicologists, so my experience has more to do with the test methods for use on humans than the toxicological mechanisms themselves.  Ask your vet what test they used to perform the drug exposure assessment. Most likely, they used an OTC or \"rapid test\" for humans, and as one of the other posters here noted, those tests are not validated for use in animals.  The current gold standard for toxicological drug screening is gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS), but, over time, liquid chromatography coupled to a multi-dimensional mass spectrometer (LC/MS/MS) will eventually become the gold standard.  In my expert opinion, I prefer LC/MS/MS because the sample preparation is simpler, but, in terms of quality of results, I am much more trusting of test results obtained with GC/MS or LC/MS/MS than those obtained via rapid test kits, which have much more limited diagnostic utility due to high rates of false positives and false negatives coupled with low population prevalence.  If your vet did use an OTC or rapid test\u2014which is almost certain, since a vet's office will almost surely not have a GC/MS or LC/MS/MS system\u2014then they will have missed detection of exposure to marijuana, THC, CBD, or related compounds (see references below).  ## TOXICITY OF THC EXPOSURE IN DOGS Although THC and the other metabolites in the cannabis plant have a wide margin of safety (MoS)\u2014which is also known as the \"*therapeutic window*\"\u2014in animals (*i.e.* the ratio of the lethal concentration divided by the minimum therapeutic concentration), the LD50 for THC in dogs is not well-established (see references below). Also, there is a lot of literature showing that toxic exposures of marijuana and related compounds in dogs has increased in states where marijuana has been legalized (see references below).  ## CITATIONS 1.

    "\n\nHuman: Sloppy Euthanasia performed on our dog Our small town vet is closing in a month (likely due to staffing issues). Things have gone down hill over the last couple years, but we kept giving them business in hopes that things would get better. Our dog (Pug, 12 years old) was diagnosed with cancer (with the help of a larger veterinary hospital), it had spread to his lungs, and we decided we would put him down before his quality of life got worse.  We go in for our scheduled appointment, there\u2019s other dogs coming in and out of appointments, they\u2019re about 10 mins late to call us back. Meanwhile we\u2019re crying because we have already said our goodbyes, and he is anxiously sniffing everything in the lobby and giving himself strained breathing. We\u2019re finally called back, the vet comes to our dog on the floor, she pets him for a solid minute without saying a word- we\u2019re just in shock at this point.  She gives him the anesthesia, and she walks out of the room... a couple minutes later, he\u2019s asleep, in a pile of drool on the cold floor\u2026 I\u2019m confused and sobbing at this point. Everything feels wrong. At this point I wanted to pick him up and walk him right out.  She comes back in after 10-15 minutes, and attempts to give him the final shot\u2026. It doesn\u2019t work for some reason so she switches legs, it doesn\u2019t work, there\u2019s blood dripping all over him and her, she\u2019s not saying ANYTHING. Finally the next attempt was successful. My mom thought she saw him growl when the vet was poking him multiple times. His facial muscles were still twitching when we left him in the room. Our hearts are broken because we think he died scared, and in pain. It was so important for this to go smoothly for us and for him. He was so special to us. We feel awful for not taking him elsewhere. I\u2019ve read things like \u201cthe anesthesia makes it impossible to interpret pain\u201d  Can you guys please reassure me that he died in a painless sleep and that the experience was shitty for my Mom and me, but not necessarily our poor pup.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Am I being selfish by keeping my cat alive? My male cat is almost 16 and we\u2019re really considering having him put down. He obviously has bad arthritis, his back legs are stiff, he can longer jump up properly. He has lost all his muscle and you can feel almost every bone and bump. He drinks way too much water and sometimes has blood in his poop. We took him to the vet about 5 months ago, expecting to have him put down but they told us they couldn't find anything wrong with him and believed it a stomach infection. They gave us some medication for him, which perked him up a little bit for the duration of the medication but now he is just getting bad again. I understand that it would be best for him, and I know it is coming. I think I'm just putting it off as long as possible because I've had him since a child, since he was 8 weeks old and only said goodbye to another of my cats in August of last year, which ripped my heart out. I just feel almost cruel for keeping him alive for my own sake.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Its day 4 and puppy refuses to eat and has been vomitting multiple times Preface: we live in a very small Muslim Asian country where dogs aren't common and the vet here are Muslims who mostly see and treat cats a majority of their time, they're also not used to handling dogs in general from the experience we've had (I've nothing against the religion, this is just background info). The town I live in is tiny and the vet here is ill equipped; the next city over is a 2 hours car drive where they would have the equipment (i.e. an ultrasound) to try and find the cause of the problem.  Puppy is 5 months old, vaccinated, normally 13.5kg (30lbs) and we rescued him when he was approx 6 weeks old abandoned in a drainage (he's classed as a Southeast Asian village dog by EmbarkVet).  Summary of symptoms:  * Vomits multiple times * Lethargy * Refuses to eat * Weight loss * Very runny stool (occurred only once) * No fever  **Day 1**  I woke my pup up at 7am in his crate to see he's still somewhat asleep. This is weird as normally he'd wake me up and he would usually walk out of the crate within 5 seconds of me opening. We have our morning walk but I cut it short as I see he's not too energetic. I serve him breakfast kibbles and he refused his food. He refused lunch as well. He also refused his treats and would spit it out. I tried chicken breast and he ate it, so I served him a small amount of rice and chicken breast because it concerned me he wasn't taking anything. That was the only meal he had. He was very low energy the whole day and spent his time on the couch chilling. He also did not poop at all this day.  **Day 2**  I woke him up at 7am again to see he has vomited in his crate. He seemed energetic so we had a short walk and he finally pooped (solid stool) and on the way back, he vomited white/yellow foam bile. He vomited again two more times at home. We waited for the nearby vet to open at 9am to bring him. Vet prescribed metoclopramide (for the vomiting?), liver support pills and b-plex. They also gave us Royal Canin Convalesce Support (RCCS) to force feed him. Back home, he ends up vomiting out all the pills we gave and all the food we force fed. He also vomited every time he drank water. Puppy has no energy and we see visible weight loss  **Day 3**  I woke him up at 7am again and he's vomited 2 times in his play pen. We brought him back to the vet and told them about day 2. We asked for an IV drip (administered under the skin) as he was now skin and bones and dehydrated. He's also lost 1.5kg (3lbs). During this time, he had a runny stool outside the vet's office which the vet saw. No blood, just very runny. They prescribed metronidazole (antibiotics) which they helped him take. We also managed to get him to take the metoclopramide and both pills stayed down. We force fed him a small amount of the RCCS 2 hours after the vet visit and he puked it all out 5 minutes after. My SO & I decided to not feed him at all to allow his stomach to recover (after doing some googling) as we notice the vomiting happens after he drinks water or we feed him the RCCS. In the evening, we got him to take the pills but he puked out the antibiotics minutes after he drank a bit of water.  **Day 4**  This is where I'm at now, we just woke him up at 630am and it is now 8am my time. Luckily he hasn't vomited in his pen which is a positive sign but he still refuses food and has no energy. He's looking even thinner than he was yesterday. Our options are either, go to another vet nearby for a second opinion or drive up 2 hours to the city and get him checked there and ask for an ultrasound to see what's going on in his stomach. Or we stick to the prescribed plan and ride it out. We have not given him his pills yet this morning as we fear he may puke it out again. We feel quite defeated that everytime we force feed his pill or food, he is hating us for handling him in such a way and he ends up vomiting soon after.  Any advice?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Said goodbye to my sweet girl 4 days ago\u2026I can\u2019t live with this guilt. Will the vet meet with me again to talk about what happened? We lost our sweet baby girl 4 days ago to saddle thrombus. She also had fluid in her lungs and was in shock and severely low body temperature. We were told she would not make it and the best thing we could do for her is say goodbye. It all happened so fast. She was fine and healthy then suddenly her legs started to give out and she had trouble breathing. They said her body temp was below 90 degrees and she was in shock. She had an embolism and a stroke. They said we could take her to an animal hospital to a cardiologist but after calling the hospital they said in 15 years of emergency medicine a cat has not survived this. I didn\u2019t want to put her through the transport. In my mind it would have to happen immediately and she was so sick. I know regret thinking we could have gotten her temp up her oxygen up and then transport. I regret my decision. It is the biggest mistake in my life. I let my girl down, I didn\u2019t protect her and I can\u2019t forgive myself. I am scared it will eat me alive. If I call the vet (this was an emergency vet we did not know her) can I pay to have a counseling meeting. To go over everything again. I keep replaying those final Hours over and over in my head. I can\u2019t leave my house. I can\u2019t eat. I can\u2019t shower. This is destroying me. I miss her so much and I feel like she could still be here. I feel like I did this\n\nAssistant:": {

I am not a vet, so I can\u2019t directly answer your question but I\u2019ve done my share of making \u201cthat choice\u201d over the years with beloved pets. Let me tell you you absolutely positively did the right thing by your girl. You saw she was in distress, you took her for emergency care, and you were prepared to take her to a cardiac specialist on an emergency basis (something that frankly a lot of pet owners can\u2019t or won\u2019t do because of cost) and then most importantly, when the cardiac specialist told you they recommend that yo NOT bring her because all it would do is cause pain and stress for your animal with no chance at recovery you chose to LISTEN to the advice and to end your girl\u2019s suffering.   You couldn\u2019t have saved your girl. She was dying and dying in a manner that the specialist told you they wouldn\u2019t be able to stop. It is our duty as people who love our pets to make the choice to spare their suffering when we can\u2019t spare their lives. If I could make a wish for the animals of the world I would wish they all could have lives with an owner like you who loves their animals so much that they can let them go when it is time.  I am not sure if the vet will talk with you - but whether they do or not I would heartily recommend you also talk to a therapist. Don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t talk about your grief to a therapist because it\u2019s about an animal, it\u2019s about a part of your family and they hear stuff like that all the time (I\u2019ve spoken to therapists about pet loss personally.)

Our dog has been having some bad hot spots/constant itching. I knew we needed flea meds, so I made an appointment so I could get the prescription flea meds he needed. The vet recommended a mousse (Douxo), and also some blood tests, since he had lost weight. The exam, blood tests, and mousse came to $330, and that did not include prescription flea meds, as I had to go somewhere else to get those. Anyway, after looking at my receipt, I noticed that the Douxo was $50, and looking online, I see that it normally is sold for $20. I already felt like I had overpaid, but not sure if it\u2019s worth calling about. Is that kind of mark up just typical?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Pet Cat Found Dead Under Strange Conditions - Seeking Potential Help? So we have two cats, Millie and Cindy. A few days ago we found Millie dead in the backyard. She was bleeding from her ears and nose, but had no signs of physical damage. No cuts and no broken bones. She was also soaking wet when we saw her in the morning. We do have a pool so it\u2019s possible she drowned, but we found her in the yard about 20 feet away from the pool. We live in the South so it was likely the dew.   Our other cat, Cindy, is nowhere to be seen since we found her sister(2 days). So we are wondering if she ran away after finding Millie dead or if something also happened to Cindy. Is it common for cats to run off their companion dies? And can anyone offer insight on way may have happened to Millie? We don\u2019t expect any human foul play and an attack from another animal seems unlikely as she had no physical damage other than the bleeding in her ears and nose. I should also say both cats are only a few years old.  Any help I\u2019d appreciate, thanks.\n\nAssistant:": {

A lot more time is spent trying to pass legislature against firearms and money spent on stopping the import and sale of narcotics than there is for stricter guidelines on the road. A fraction of the people are killed by over dosing, murder or suicide than auto accidents.  Driving school should be mandatory for all new drivers. A driving test should have to be administered with each renewal of a persons drivers license.   More money should be spent on technology to monitor, track and catch speeding and reckless drivers.   There should be zero tolerance for any driver operating a vehicle under the influence. Texting and driving should be more than a ticket/citation.  So many lives have been taken out due to pure human stupidity. I would like strides to be taken to make the roads a safer place.

            " Because cars are such a necessity for daily life, tightening restrictions may actually have the opposite effect you desire. Some people will be know they'll be unable to get a license and will just say \"fuck it, I need a car to do XYZ and I need to do XYZ so fuck what the government says I'm gonna drive a car without a license.\" So now instead of them at least passing the requirements we have now, they have nothing, and cause even more accidents.",
            " Driving is incredibly safe and every year it gets safer.  Its significantly safer than 10 years ago which is significantly safer than 10 years before that.  We're down to 1.16 per 100 million miles driven, which is a number so small it is a bit hard to describe, but let me take a stab at it.  Suppose you could die ONLY from a traffic accident and from the moment you turned 18 you started driving 24 hours a day 7 days a week at 60 mph.  On average, you'd expect to live another 164 years to a ripe age of 182 using the average fatalities per mile.  That is because it'd take you on average 100/1.16=86 million miles to get into a fatal car accident, and that is just how many years of 24/7 driving it take you to reach that many miles.  If you drove a much more reasonable 8 hours a day (which is still a HUGE amount of driving), it'd take you on average 492 more years after 18 to die, living to an age of 510 years old.  And that is mixing ALL kinds of driving from drunk driving to motorcycle driving to nighttime driving.  If you were to drive a light truck while sober and during the day, your chance of dying would be SIGNIFICANTLY less.  And people that violate those kinds of things (driving at night, driving a motorcycle, driving drunk) wouldn't really be helped with more stringent testing.",

            " This is a solution that might work but isn't the best. A better solution would be to tackle the ways that the law and governments give subsidies to drivers, and therefore have fewer people drive and less accidents. This paper is like 80 pages of examples of all the ways we make it too easy and cheap to drive.  https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3345366  A quick rundown of a couple policies that would be better and tackle other problems as well.  1) remove free parking:   Pretty much every city has a requirement that a new building has to come with parking. Some of this is so insane where if you build an office building, an equal amount of space for offices legally  needs to be dedicated to parking.   this is a policy that makes it cheap to drive and ruins cities. LA and many large cities have something like 30 spots of free car parking per resident, this is insane and leads to sprawl and makes drivers not have to bare the full cost of their cars.    2) vehicular manslaughter  If I swing an object  around recklessly in a park and hit a kid and kill him, I go to prison for manslaughter. It doesn't matter if it's a baseball bat, a sledgehammer, or a brick, I still go to jail. But if I text and drive and run over a kid in a park, that gets a lighter sentence. Remove this and permenantly revoke licenses.   3) carbon and climate change  The IPCC recommends a carbon tax of a max of $5,500 per ton of carbon in order to prevent damage from climate change. If this were implemented,  it would be about a $4.80 additional tax per gallon of gas. This would make it expensive to drive and would drop accidents by having less people on the road.   Driving itself is dangerous and not a solution that takes human flaws into consideration. Accidents happen because people are not perfect, the only solution is to remove or lessen cars and the amount of driving.",

            " In the country I'm from it is kind of difficult to obtain a driver's licence. You first have to finish a around a month of theory and then pass your exam and then you need to have 20 hours of mandatory driving lessons with a driving instructor. After you've done all that you can sign up for a driving exam. The exam is usually around 40 minutes and consists of a parking exam and a drive through a city. The queues for exams are very long as well and during summer they can reach more than a month. It's been 5 months since I started this whole thing and I still don't have my licence yet, partly due to me failing my driving exam twice and having to wait a month after each time. The exams are very strict especially if you're a guy.  Also you can officially get a driving licence when you reach the age of 18 but are allowed to drive a  car from age 16 if you have someone sitting next to you, who has had a driver's licence for 4 or 3 years.  Besides that there aren't many things that would keep people from breaking driving laws. Most people outside cities already drive above the speed limit, it's the norm here. Except were there are speed radars or idk what they're called.  So yeah... at least where I'm from I think that the rules for obtaining a driver's licence could stay the same but something more should be done about those who break the driving rules after obtaining they're licences.",

            " Now don't get me wrong here. I hate cars. I moved to a city with a subway system specifically so I could sell my car. And don't disagree they're dangerous. I once compared deaths caused by cars with various cancers to get a sense of scale. As I recall the stats I read said cars caused about 10,000 per year on average, which is about on par with the death rate from the fourth or fifth deadliest cancer. So yeah, it's a serious problem. But Americans tolerate it for a reason. It's not like we're the first people to notice how dangerous cars are. The reason is in most cities in America you need a car to survive. Most American cities are designed in a very spread out, suburban model meant specifically for cars. Public transportation usually varies from between non existent and inadequate. Bigger cities usually have a bus system that will get you to about 40% of the city's addresses. A good chunk of the population does not live within walking distance of any sort of stores. When you build a country like that you're essentially conceding that having a driver's license is necessity that it should be easy for everyone to get, consequences be damned. If you make it hard to get a license it's going to cause serious hardship for millions of Americans through no fault of their own. A fairer way to address the issue would be to make it easier to lose your license for aggressive driving. I know tons of absolutely horrible, reckless drivers who still somehow have a license. Getting rid of that shit gives everyone a shot at driving and if they lose their license it's their own fault.",

If you make it hard to get a license it's going to cause serious hardship for millions of Americans through no fault of their own. A fairer way to address the issue would be to make it easier to lose your license for aggressive driving. I know tons of absolutely horrible, reckless drivers who still somehow have a license. Getting rid of that shit gives everyone a shot at driving and if they lose their license it's their own fault.",

It should be noted, that while others posted such studies, there is another big angle of this:   Even if one could poke holes in such studies, and imply that trans women may yet have some lingering possible subtle advantage over other women, so do other women have advantages over each other.   There COULD be interesting legitimate discussions to be had about the philosophical principles behind dividing sports into \"fair\" categories.   Why do we have weight classes in wrestling and boxing, but no height classes in basketball or horse jockeying?    Why do we have paralympics for disabled people, but no special olypics for people whose bodies are only *mildly* shittier than those peak superhuman pro athletes?   Why don't we have different leagues for people of different races, that strongly correlate with performance?   Ultimately the answer to these is that sports are a social construct, and it's up to us what communities we want to go out of our way to represent, otherwise it is inevitable that most people in the world don't have a chance to compete in an open league.   The anti-trans position has to keep going on about how men are super strong and women are super weak, and never the twain shall meet, otherwise, if we are talking about subtle arbitrary dividing lines between fair and unfair advantages, they would have to get into openly spelling out that they don't see trans women as women and that's it.",

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: Doors to public restrooms should open outwards instead of inwards I'm talking about the doors to get in and out of the larger restroom itself, NOT stalls. There are *a lot* of people including myself who will do everything to avoid touching bathroom door handles, because they're disgusting. In an ideal world everyone cleans their hands adequately before leaving a public restroom but we all know that's not the case.   **It's** **Unsanitary:**  Door handles are highly-touched surfaces that provide an excellent method of transmission for viruses and bacteria if not cleaned, and given what restrooms are for, door handles are now the perfect surface for nastier bacteria and viruses to get transmitted. There are very few surfaces in most recently-built public restrooms that a user must touch (given all the automatic toilets, faucets, and paper-towel dispensers), but most still force the user to grab the door handle in order to leave since the doors swing *into* the restroom instead of outwards. This essentially guarantees the user will come into contact with bacteria or viruses lingering on the surface unless they use a barrier.   **It defeats the purpose of handwashing:**  The purpose of handwashing, is to *sanitize* your hands before handling food, touching a wound, or partaking in some activity that creates a situation with higher-than-normal vulnerability to infections. It's been proven that while sanitizing your hands with rubbing alcohol or some other cleaner *is effective,* handwashing is optimal. You wouldn't want your surgeon just throwing some *Purell* on their hands before operating on you! Forcing the user of a restroom to interact with a highly-touched surface that is extremely dirty *after washing their hands,* even with a barrier like paper towel, just defeats the purpose of handwashing!   **Why doors that open outwards are superior:**  The user can push the door outwards with their body to leave, instead of being forced to pull the door open using the handle, meaning their hands can stay \"clean\". Furthermore, since people of all different heights, the **average** concentration of bacteria in one particular spot on the door should theoretically be *less* than on the door handle as the surface area of the door handle is obviously much smaller than the surface area of the entire door, so people who insist on using their hands will be pushing from a larger variety of locations on the door itself.  TLDR: Public restroom doors should open outwards since it's more sanitary.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: Changing the WHOLE Spanish language to make ''inclusive'' nouns / pronouns is a bunch of nonsense. Context: In some Latin American countries (mostly south America) people are startiing to change the way they talk to make ''inclusive'' nouns. There 2 tipes of articles in spanish: las y los which in english both would be ''the'', and some extra rules apply to them:  -''Las'' is supposed to be used when you are talking about just female  nouns (nouns can be male or female). Examples:Las revistas (The magazines), Las mujeres (The women), Las ni\u00f1as (The chidren, specifically girls).  -''Los'' is supposed to be used when there is just male objects or a combination of 2 or more genders (since there supposedly are 56+ now). For example: los zapatos (the shoes), los hombres (The men), Los ni\u00f1os (The children, just male or a group of male and female children).  After a while and the women rights movement, people started to use both articles. For example: Las y los compa\u00f1eros (The classmates, both male article (which means anything) and female (Which is extra here)).  Some other solutions have come up as using an ''@'' to say L@s amig@s (The friends, male and female).  This is already a step in the wrong direction, but it was mostly used in politics when talking about women's rights.  Now the fun stuff. With all this movements of the ten thousand genders people started to get offended and ''misrepresented'' in the language itself. Now they all want us to use ''Los'' for male, ''Las'' for female and ''Les'' foe everything else. Even though if we say ''Los'' the language rules say that we are actually referring to the group of people regardless of the genders.   On top of everything they get offended if we don't use Los, las, and les in every single sentence apart from also changing the gender suffix in every word.   So instead of saying los coma\u00f1eros (The classmates), we have to say Los, Las y Les compa\u00f1eros, compa\u00f1eras y compa\u00f1eres for us not to offend anyone.   Also for saying \"them\", we can't use \"Ellos\" to refer to a goup of people regardless of the gender. We have to say Ellos, ellas y elles, which not only sounds super incorrect, but it also is over complicating an already complex part of the language. Because objects also have genders by rule. (We can't say \"la martillo\", we say \"el martillo\" which both translated would be \"the hammer\", another example is  \"La calceta\" which is correct, but \"El calceta\" isn't, both being \"the sock\" in english) How will we know which object is male, female, Agender, alexigender, aliusgender, amicangender, ambonec, Apconsugender, Aquarigender, Cannedgender, circgender, and a long loong etcetera.  Why over complicate ourselves over this little, insignificant thing when there are more and bigger problems than this. Especially in these countries.  This is also happening in California replacing Latino and Latina by Latinx and not saying Hispanic because someway it implies Colonialism. While absolutely nobody has complained about it.  TL;DR: People want to reform an entire language just because some other want to have their very own article. Which will over complicate the already complex system of object genders in Spanish while crating a lot of other problems. All of this while we could be focusing in a lot of more serious things. ____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: Affirmative Action is bad policy (even from a progressive/SJW perspective). Generally, arguments against Affirmative Action are levied from a conservative (sometimes racist) perspective. Those against AA generally deny the existence of systemic racism or historical injustice against black people in the United States. Opponents of AA also tend to look down upon its recipients, believing that they don't deserve it.  I would consider myself a progressive. I acknowledge that historical injustice and systemic racism exist. However, I am still against AA as a policy for two main reasons: 1) it doesn't use progressive values to approach social justice, and 2) there is insufficient evidence that it is effective policy.  **Affirmative Action isn't progressive.**  * Two foundational progressive ideas are that race is a social construct and social justice should be viewed through an intersectional lens. Keeping these two ideas in mind, AA is not a very progressive policy. * Race is a social construct. That is the most scientific way to look at it. Even from a less academic, more practical standpoint it makes more sense to view race as a social construct. Some black people look Hispanic, some Hispanics look black, other Hispanics look white. Indians can look Hispanic or black depending on the season. The fact that we lump East Asians and Indians into the category of \"Asian\", despite them looking nothing alike or having little to no cultural similarities should make you question the way we view race in America. At one point in American history, Irish and Italian immigrants weren't considered white and were called white n-words, so even the category of \"white\" isn't fixed. * If you accept this premise that race is a social construct, then race-based AA becomes very complicated; it becomes very difficult to gauge who \"deserves\" AA. Why do Hispanics who look white receive AA when Indians that look black do not? What about mixed race children? Indians, Irishmen, Italians, ethnic Jews, Chinese, and Japanese\u2014while they weren't enslaved like black people\u2014faced massive discrimination historically, and in some cases are still victims of discrimination today, yet these groups don't benefit from AA at all. * Intersectionality is the idea that social categories such as race, class, and gender are interconnected and combine to create unique levels of discrimination and privilege. This further complicates the role of AA. Why should white women benefit the most from AA? Should Nigerian immigrants, who are arguably the most successful ethnic group in the US and whose ancestors have not been victims of slavery in America, benefit from AA? It could also be argued that it is unfair not to consider class. Why should a white female student coming from an affluent family receive AA over a white male student coming from a destitute family? What about transgender students? Should a trans male receive AA because he is trans, or because he was/is biologically female, or should he be seen as having male privilege?  **Affirmative Action is not effective.**  * The stated goal of AA is to address racial inequality by providing opportunities to marginalized groups that have been squandered by historically racism and/or current systemic racism. I don't believe there is sufficient evidence to suggest that AA is effective policy for achieving that goal. One of the most comprehensive studies on AA concludes that its efficiency is ambiguous at best and the redistributive effects may not be large. Given that AA has been around for over 50 years and its effects are ambiguous at best, I feel like it is safe to say it is not effective. * An analysis of 45 studies on AA suggests that it can perpetuate negative stigmas. So, not only is AA not very effective, it can also be harmful.  **Conclusion**  * I see AA as trying to use a band-aid to patch a severe laceration. It may or may not help, but there are more effective ways to deal with the issue of social injustice. Also, implementing AA without committing social injustice in the process seems very complicated when considering intersectionality and the socially constructed nature of race.  **Better Solutions IMO**  * End the war on drugs. Blacks use and sell drugs at similar rates as whites, but are 6.5 times as likely to be incarcerated for drug-related crimes. Ending the drug war could end the mass incarceration of black and brown men in America. Being raised in a single-parent household is associated with more juvenile crime, worse educational outcomes, behavioral and emotional issues, etc. Less incarceration could mean more intact families and better outcomes for black and brown children. * Improve access to abortion and contraceptives. This can also help combat teenage pregnancies and reduce single-parent households. * Don't fund schools from property taxes. Poorer (often black) neighborhoods levy less property taxes, which leads to underfunded schools. Education should be the great equalizer, but this system amplifies inequality between the rich and the poor. * I believe these solutions, unlike AA, are closer to targeting the root causes of the racial inequality in America today. That being said, I am not a policy expert. These are just some of the many potential solutions.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: Modern theories on free will seem to show everything is deterministic, which leaves no room for responsibility. I feel like there is free will and therefore room for responsibility. I am not an expert on this subject, so my ideas about free will have mainly come from reading some neuroscience:  e.g. the prefrontal cortex having a veto power on decisions.   e.g. humans having no power to decide to do something and our decisions being made before 'our' input as in the Libet experiements, where choices were shown to have been made prior to 'us' choosing a course of action.  People like Sam Harris (I've seen lots of critiques, people calling him a hack etc, but just an example of someone who has that view) also talk about the universe being deterministic, i.e. that murderer could only have done the murder due to their environment, biology etc.  I can see there is no 'ghost in the machine', but although unfalsifiable, it feels like we have some kind of free will, although perhaps its just the brain playing tricks on itself.   With the above theories that environment and biology, how can we really maintain the legal system which punishes for things which are beyond people's control according to the above? How are people able to break out of addictions and change their behaviours if we have no free will? If I have got the above theory wrong then fair enough, but that's what I understand by it.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: \"Tiger King\" as a documentary fails to adequately educate its audience about why private big cat ownership is harmful. *Tiger King* is a weird documentary. One of the stated purposes is to explore private big cat ownership\u2014in fact, that is stated outright in the first episode by director Eric Goode\u2014and yet it rarely delves into the *big cat* part of that topic. Instead, the bulk of the documentary is a circus freak show, using these people and their personalities for pure entertainment, combined a bit with a thread of true crime and the story of how Joe Exotic went to jail and how Baskin allegedly murdered her husband, the tigers and other big cats serving simply as a backdrop.  As a result, the series attempts to equivocate the roadside zoos like the GW Zoo with Carole Baskin's Big Cat Rescue, when in fact there are several key differences between them that are relevant to the documentary's supposed topic:  1. Guest interaction, including cub petting, feeding, and playing with the animals.  2. Staff interaction, including entering the enclosures with the animals unnecessarily, moving or feeding animals unsafely, and removing cubs from mothers and keeping them in cribs in the home.  3. Using the animals for profit, and euthanizing them when they are no longer profitable.  4. Most importantly, irresponsibly breeding, including crossbreeding, captive animals for profit. Zoos and other institutions accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums that breed animals take precautions to increase genetic diversity as much as possible, with the goal of conservation and re-introduction to the wild. The breeding that GW Zoo and Antle engage in encourage inbreeding and genetic homogeneity. The crossbred animals serve no conservation purpose whatsoever, and the inbred cubs are separated from their mothers and destined to continue the cycle of private ownership of big cats.  That's not to say Big Cat Rescue is perfect\u2014it and Carole Baskin have their own issues to be sure\u2014but these are some of the most problematic aspects of private ownership of wild animals, and yet they get very little attention in the show. I have seen several reactions online that fail to grasp these distinctions or see the Big Cat Rescue as equally bad as places like the GW Zoo.  The series doesn't help in that regard, as they clearly try to play up the rivalry between Joe Exotic and Carole Baskin, and allow Joe's claims that GW Zoo is the same as Big Cat Rescue go relatively unchallenged except by Carole herself, playing up that rivalry. Tim Stark at one point makes the claim that breeding is beneficial to endangered animals because they increase the number of tigers, something that is completely and utterly false (the animals they breed are completely unsuited for release, due to genetics and how they are raised), and yet there is no push back from the documentary at all. There are no interviews with professional zookeepers, biologists, veterinarians, or anyone from the AZA, people who would be authorities on animal care and welfare.  If the series wanted to be solely about the interpersonal drama of these people, that'd be fine. They are admittedly entertaining. However, the series intersperses enough tidbits that focus on *some* of the problems with big cats in captivity that it is easy to mistake it as being about that. The scenes of Joe separating cubs from their mother, accidents at the zoo, or of the aftermath of the zoo in Zanesville show some of the dangers of big cat ownership. But what makes those parks different from genuine sanctuaries, rescues, and zoos is not explored. There's no juxtaposition to places that are able to keep big cats responsibly, and Carole Baskin and Big Cat Rescue are lumped in with the others for the sake of drama.  I see this as a critical failure given the stated mission of the documentary to explore big cats in captivity. It actively misleads its audience if they are coming to learn about animals in captivity. The comments I have seen online just reinforce that. Instead of educating viewers on animals in captivity, most seem to be confused as to what exactly makes roadside zoos and private ownership of big cats so harmful for the animals. They glorify or defend Joe Exotic, despite him engaging in outright animal abuse, while attacking Carole Baskin and Big Cat Rescue because she is portrayed as unlikable or phony.\n\nAssistant:": {

Washington needs rational, individualistic politics, not  the current tribal madness tearing our country apart.   GW warned of this in his farewell address.   PS: I don\u2019t really have a political stance, I just believe in general libertarian, humanist ideas and a regulated capitalist economy.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Good idea, but I have ideas I want to push forward that I'll have a hard time doing on my own. Maybe I'll try to form a group of like-minded individuals, so that we can pool our resources and cooperate to achieve our legislative goals.  Of course, if we wish to do this we need people who also agree with us in office, so we'll choose people from our own ranks and give them our backing to get elected!  Certainly other people will try this too, so we'll Confederate with other groups that hold fairly similar views and work our way until we've got a tent that covers a sizable percentage of the voter block.  Of course by this point we've got a problem: with so many people under us, how do we choose who we have represent us in elections? What if we do a pseudo-election before the main one? All the infrastructure is there, and this gives us a chance to choose a good candidate without splitting our like minded group of friends' voting power!  Yes without parties, I think America will fare well with my big group of like minded friends.",

            " What if there were a middle solution and we had more political parties and better access for other political parties than the Rs and Ds?  The Rs and Ds control the debates so a libertarian/green/etc can\u2019t get the same exposure  I do like the idea, but political parties are sometimes necessary for things like fundraising.  Also it is easier for a lot of Americans to pick a party instead of a candidate if they haven\u2019t researched everyone, which would take a lot of time.  I\u2019m not sure if you have voted, but researching 3-6 candidates for every spot on the ballot just isn\u2019t something most Americans will do.  I\u2019d love to see there be 6-8 parties to vary the lines in both economics and personal freedoms plus a middle everything party.    A lot more Americans are ideologically libertarian (small l) than vote that way, so if there were more parties and equal footing for each we would see a lot more libertarians in office.  I may not have time to research everyone who\u2019s running for some small local or state position, but I know if there\u2019s 6 people running and ones a libertarian they are going to skew towards more personal and economic freedoms and a smaller government, so if I share those ideals I vote for that person.  It\u2019s hard to now with just two parties because you have people who really should be in a libertarian, green, socialist, or other parties, but are either an R or D.

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: Voting for someone in the primary just because you think that they are \"electable\" is a poor way of choosing a candidate. Just to get this out of the way in the beginning, although this view is partially based on the current Democrat primary, I do not care which of them wins. This isn't an attempt to sway the vote for or away from a particular candidate.   OK, so here are my thoughts.   First: Voting for a candidate just because you think that they can be elected in the general election is ineffectual. If a person is actually \"electable\" then the odds are that they will be able to win the primary anyway. One of the goals of the primary should be to determine if they actually do have the skills and personal appeal to get people to vote for them. Using eligibility as a factor to cast your vote short circuits this process.  Second: You, as a partisan primary voter, probably do not have a good sense of who is actually electable in the general election anyway. It is likely that you are fairly biased toward your own political philosophy and can't fairly  judge who would appeal to moderate voters. You are just voting for the person who everyone else is telling you is electable.   Third: Let's face it, the word \"electable\" in this context is essentially going to be synonymous with \"boring and inoffensive\". A candidate who is running on their electability is not going to be someone who is generating excitement.   Looking back over the past few elections, how well has the \"electable\" candidate faired? Bob Dole, Al Gore, John Kerry, John McCain, and Mitt Romney were all classic \"electable candidates\". They were all elder statesmen, with impressive credentials, who generated little enthusiasm. They all lost.  How well did the upstart radical candidates do?   Barack \"Hussein\" Obama was a black candidate with the middle name of a terrorist dictator. He had very little experience with politics. He had a shady backstory. On paper, not electable.     Donald Trump was a New York billionaire who most people knew as a host of a reality TV show. He insulted people, had questionable financial dealings, and was constantly making controversial statements. Also, not someone who would be considered to be electable.   They both won, and they won because people were excited to vote for them.  That's pretty much my view. Feel free to vote for who you want to vote for.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " 1. Because of the US electoral system, the question of electability becomes a question of: \"in what domain\". It becomes not about who is the best candidate, or even who the most would vote for, but rather who can win the electoral college. So, for instance, if you have two equally matched candidates for the democratic party, but one is from California and one is from MI, you might pick the one from MI to increase the odds of winning MI since CA is basically a freebie for a democrat. So in some, maybe even most, cases, the most electable candidate might win the primary too, but in some situations, like possibly the 2020 election, that's not the case. If things are sufficiently polarized where the vast majority of people will just vote for a particular party then picking the candidate that will best get the people who haven't \"picked\" a party is the best option, especially if those voters are in swing states. I do agree it's a shitty system and one that should be changed, but if you think Yang best matches your values, but will lose to many moderate votes in swing states, then maybe you want'd Biden, thinking he's a lesser of evils and will more likely get those moderate votes. 2. I think moderates have a good sense of who moderates would vote for, but more to the point, you don't need to go based on your opinion, you can take expert's opinion and polls.  3. Electability varies wildly from election to election. JFK and Reagan were very electable because they were exciting and charming. Carter won because the country didn't like Ford, and H Bush won because he was pragmatic. In fact some argue the worst thing to happen to McCain was bringing on Sarah Palin, an upstart radical.

He was an accomplished lawyer, a State Legislator, a State Senator, then Presidential candidate. It wasn't like he just popped out of nowhere.  He also had the advantage of being Charismatic and, once again, being an opposition party candidate after a deeply unpopular Republican Bush presidency as winding down.  > Donald Trump was a New York billionaire who most people knew as a host of a reality TV show. He insulted people, had questionable financial dealings, and was constantly making controversial statements. Also, not someone who would be considered to be electable.

When you kill a person, you're an asshole, no question, and very dangerous.  So certainly you should be punished harshly.  But when you kill a police officer, you are demonstrating that you have just 0 respect for social structures; that you are so off-balance, you can cut through the societal deference given police officers like butter.

Now understand, I'm not in favor of complete deference to police; that's called tyranny, and we have too much of it already.

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: The Electoral College should be abolished in favor of a national popular vote. If not abolished, there should at least be no Winner-Take-All States. Hi all,  With the election coming up in just a few months, I have been thinking a lot about voting and how to make the election \u201cfair\u201d for everyone. I believe that the electoral college is unhealthy for a democracy such as our own, and that a presidential candidate elected from anything other than a popular vote is unfair for voters.   As the situation stands today, presidential candidates spend a majority of their campaigns in swing states, hoping to win over that state and increase their chance of getting elected. The most fair option would be to switch to a popular vote, as the president is supposed to represent the people\u2019s wants equally.   The original purpose of the electoral college was to provide the country a means of \u201csaving itself\u201d: the electorates would be an educated group that could override the citizens of the US if they made an uneducated decision. However, with more restrictions binding electorates to choose the candidate their constituents voted for, that purpose is no longer served.   At the very least (if popular vote is not an option), there should be no winner take all states, as that means that if a candidate wins a swing state by a small margin, they get all of the electoral votes. Winner take all systems are even worse at reflecting the will of the American people than the electoral college.\n\nAssistant:": {

Economic aid and pulbic funding gets put into the areas around and in Busan and Seoul and Jeollado gets scraps at best. One thing I can say with certainty is that while living in several cities in Jeollado province I saw a lot of slums, but when I visited Seoul I never saw any.

If we had a different system, such as Single transferable vote for local districts and something like the Alternative voting system (also called the runoff voting system) in place for the presidential vote I feel like things would be a lot better, and if we had systems like that which gave citizens a greater voice and helped to encourage more political options than just two parties I would be fine with doing away with the electoral college.   I admit I'm far from an expert on political process, but the research I have done indicates that there are much better systems than what we have, and I'd really like to see those systems considered as I feel it would greatly improve the political climate of our nation and make us all much happier.

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: Trophy hunting is unethical and should be internationally banned. The hunting of animals for the main purpose of collecting trophies is a practice that causes massive amounts of damage to ecosystems, drives our most beautiful animals to extinction and is unethical not only on this basis, but on the fact that it is needless murder of a sentient being.  This applies particularly to African big game such as lions, giraffes, rhino (whoops too late), elephants etc but also to any animal hunted purely for sport.  A law that made each participating nation able to prosecute its citizens even if they went to a non-participating country to hunt would be the most effective way to deal with this.  Most of the hunters hunting big game are rich westerners, if they were able to be brought up on charges when they returned home with trophies or with pictures of them hunting lions etc splashed across their social media, it would give many a pause for thought. Outlawing ivory was a similar step but hasn't done enough.  For those who will suggest that hunting is a major economic factor in some places: the fact that it makes someone money is simply not a good enough reason to allow anything unethical. Plus, people who run hunting tours could switch to other forms of income like safaris etc and they would if the flow of hunters dried up.  For those who suggest it's a suitable conservation method: a) the most valuable (both in monetary value and prestige) big game hunted for sport are often endangered species.  B) you can control populations of other non endangered big game with means that don't glorify the killing of animals for sport.  I want to clarify that hunting for food and resources is something else entirely and I have no real issue with it if it's a necessity.  Is there any valid case for allowing trophy hunting that I am missing?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: If America really wants illegal immigrants out in order to preserve American jobs and save American tax dollars, America should take measures to reduce demand for illegal workers, rather than fight against the incentives by trying to keep them out. Here is an exchange between a friend of mine and myself, which he abandoned :(, in which I outline what I think would be a reasonable alternative strategy to wallbuilding and fix for some of the employment/economic problems of US immigration enforcement. I would like to continue the conversation with you all and invite commentary about the potential pitfalls of my design (as I do not believe it is at all the overall best solution to the immigration/employment problem, merely a system that could potentially work given the aims outlined in my title, in a vacuum), as well as direct opposition on the basis of a wall or different priorities being somehow better than this approach.  My assumption is that a physical barrier isn't effective at keeping people out, if there is sufficient incentive for them to get in. I realize my friend's argument isn't the most cohesive so I am really only including it for context on the premise. Thanks for reading.  Friend:       Have you ever worked with anyone that shouldn\u2019t be in America? I\u2019ll tell you a story about a guy named Luis. He can claim tax exempt. Has free healthcare. Gets EBT, I know because this is how he bought lunch one day. \\[Il\\]legitimately taking a job of an unemployed legal American. Working in the construction field for over 10 years has opened my eyes to the fact that no ones cares they are here they just want everything to be fair. Same healthcare opportunities, same taxes, same pay. But what I have seen is that contractors get what they pay for. Sloppy work and constant call backs. But in reference to the wall. Why does one build a fence? Is it to keep the nonsense out or keep the dog in? I say get rid of the what if\u2019s about the wall. Build it first to keep the President's promise. I believe he was asking for a little more than 2 billion for it out of a budget in the trillions. Best case scenario is we just put people to work. Essentially giving the money back to the people. Build it. Kill the argument.  My response:       My counter-proposal to your anti-immigrant sentiment is to hold the unpatriotic employers of illegal workers accountable for their illegal employment practices. If there is genuinely an American ready and willing to take a job currently being held by someone without documents, the employer of that illegal worker is culpable for cutting his fellow American out of the workforce. The employer should pay the taxes, and the benefits, and the healthcare for every illegal employee that can be proven on their payroll- as they would typically with any other employee- and pay the equivalent of a median unemployment salary for the American he has disenfranchised, and pay fines on top of it to fund enforcement of the law. That would fix every complaint \\^ you have about Luis except his shoddy workmanship...  It would remove the incentive for employers to utilize illegal labor through strict penalties. It would shift the tax burden from everyone to just the law breakers. If employers stopped employing illegal labor, it would reduce demand and not as many people would come here. Once all that deterrent is in place, we just need to enforce everything better. Perhaps you are asking why I would prefer to punish the American businesses and not punish the immigrants? The answer to that is that the immigrants mostly have no power and nothing to take away. If an immigrant comes here and works illegally, they only have their wages. If we take the job away from them, they can't pay fines, or taxes. Jailing and deporting them costs us money, not them. It's better to remove the incentive for them to be here, and have them go away on their own, or follow the proper channels (revise the VISA program, but maintain the onus of tracking on employers?) and get in legally. If you really want to solve this problem, that's the way you do it. As long as there is demand, and incentive for people to come here illegally, and for employers to employ them illegally without sufficient deterrent, people are going to find a way.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Holding employers of illegals sounds like a great plan and all... but the problem is, it's already illegal to hire an illegal immigrant, and not pay taxes on their income, etc. These things are already illegal, and already have penalties. The problem is A) we don't know exactly which companies do it, and which don't, and you can't have ICE or the FBI raid every single employer to find proof. And B) is that it is so widespread, that the justice system might not even be able to handle that many things all at once.",
            " You have the right idea, but you are missing the big reason why it hasn't worked so far, and is unlikely to work anytime soon.  Also why the government won't go for it.  &#x200B;  The problem is as always money.  Companies must be profitable or investors will refuse to give them the money they need to expand and grow.  And with the power that Wall Street now has, this is actually magnified to a huge degree.  (I know everyone likes to blame 'big business' for many of the ills of society, but its actually 'big money' that drives the decisions since upset Wall Street investors can destroy a CEO's career.)  So companies find that due to the massive amount of competition from overseas factories, they need to drive their own costs down if they are to stay profitable.  &#x200B;  But the US and State governments, in an attempt to protect workers have put in so many laws that many low level jobs are actually a detriment to the company.  These are positions they need to fill, but that cost them far more than any benefit they receive.  Yes, you could say the fact that they don't get fined for having unsanitary bathrooms is a huge benefit, but the reality is that unless someone complains, they are unlikely to get fined.  still a clean bathroom means happier and hopefully more productive employees, so you pay for janitors.  There are many other jobs like this, where the immediate benefit is very low, but there is a financial reason to employ people.  Its just the cost of complying with government regulations makes the price for filling these roles very expensive.  &#x200B;  So companies look for ways around the problem.  They figured out long ago that illegal immigrants are far more likely to accept low pay, poor working conditions and unreasonable demands, since the illegal immigrant isn't able to complain to the government.  (they'd be deported even if the company does get fined.)  So many companies are quite happy to ignore the law.  &#x200B;  And government doesn't enforce it.  Which falls into 2 categories.  The Rethugican side doesn't because they love business and want to make big business happy, and big business wants to have cheap labor.  The Demonrats don't enforce it because they see these immigrants as exploited people who will merrily vote for them in all future elections, giving the D party near permanent control over the government.  &#x200B;  The people lose.    &#x200B;  So while I'd love to agree with you on punishing the businesses.  The problem is first you have to break Wall Street's power so that CEOs and other executives are willing to look for a long term solution to their labor needs and not just looking for the quickest way to save money.

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: it\u2019s not racist to describe someone by their race i\u2019ve had people shame me for describing someone by their race/ethnicity. i never really understood why this was looked down on in the first place anyways-  the stigma around it makes it feel like their race/ethnicity is a bad thing that i shouldn\u2019t acknowledge. a while ago i read a facebook post from a woman i used to attend church with. her post talked about how other people may treat her differently because she is a black woman in a white dominated area. she went into the ridiculous amounts of racism she\u2019s dealt with over the course of her life, and how she wishes people would not put others down for such a silly difference.  my mother, who is good friends with her, messaged her telling her that when she looks at her she does not see a beautiful black woman but rather just a beautiful woman. the lady messaged back telling her that she wants her race to be seen but she wants it to be respected. she wants to be a beautiful black woman. and that is something i thought made sense.  it\u2019s about a sense of being proud of yourself. why describe someone by their style or hair when you can honor the more root of someone\u2019s being. it\u2019s nothing offensive, what makes us different is what\u2019s so unique about human beings-\n\nAssistant:": {

Rather than saying \"autistic kid\" saying \"kid with autism\" as a way to acknowledge that people are primarily human beings while recognizing what has contributed to who they are.   Though the lingo is a bit different the same idea applies in the difference between saying \"blacks\" and \"black people\" for example. A good way to tell if someone is employing a double standard is to ask yourself, would they still mention this person's race if they were white? (Also, is this person's race relevant to the point I'm making?)  I agree people who are trying to virtue signal may sometimes miss the nuance and jump straight to condemnation.

            " I used to work as a behavioral tech for kids with autism and one thing which was stressed in our training was using person first language. Rather than saying \"autistic kid\" saying \"kid with autism\" as a way to acknowledge that people are primarily human beings while recognizing what has contributed to who they are.   Though the lingo is a bit different the same idea applies in the difference between saying \"blacks\" and \"black people\" for example. A good way to tell if someone is employing a double standard is to ask yourself, would they still mention this person's race if they were white? (Also, is this person's race relevant to the point I'm making?)  I agree people who are trying to virtue signal may sometimes miss the nuance and jump straight to condemnation.  The balance is recognizing that people are different (in order to recognize disparities between groups for example) while asking ourselves if we're mentioning someone's race, sex, etc. only when they are a member of some groups and when that fact is not relevant to the topic at hand.",

I think that when someone is a distinctive race, outside the norm of the people they\u2019re surrounded by, and the only thing that even their co-workers can recognize about them, when described, is a race, it kind of feels like \u201cis that all you see?

    "\n\nHuman: Change my view thatI'm against single payer, universal healthcare. I work in healthcare and I am against single payer, universal hearth are. Here's why:  1: More people using the system means higher productivity rates. For those of you who do not work in healthcare I must tell you that sometimes you are expected to have a 90% productivity rate. That's almost impossible.   2: It will drive wages down. Just look how other healthcare providers are paid in countries with universal healthcare. It is much less than what healthcare professionals are paid in the US. Example look up how much a nurse, therapist, or physican makes in the UK and then compare it to her in the states. It is usually double in the states.   3: All these problems will deter students from pursing medical related degrees. As you know we have a shortage of physicans in this country already.   In summary, single payer, universal healthcare will result in higher productivity for even less pay. Many healthcare professionals are in massive amounts of debt. We cannot afford to make less.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " I feel like most of your ill feelings regarding single-payer revolve around the insurance companies no longer being able to pay the large amounts that healthcare professionals charge for their services (which is dictated by competitive insurance markets - I'm not attacking this practice, simply stating what I feel to be the case).  In other words, you want to hold on to the salary you're making.    While understandable, it seems that you're missing the grander point.  The whole healthcare-insurance relationship needs a complete overhaul.  With single-payer, the cost of medical procedures, etc *should* be dictated by something like the Surgeon General's office - the actual cost of doctor's time plus equipment plus materials/medicines, whatever.  I don't know the exact figures, but I feel like this is the general idea.  With that system in place regulating the price of medical aid to affordable pricing, we would then see the market even itself out, ideally, to match the salaries a doctor needs to survive.  To your points: I think the overall goal we're talking about is socialist medicine - medical care provided by the government for its people.  People throw fits about this, of course, because I used the word \"socialist\".  Socialized medicine could result in the doctors' education itself being provided by the government.  This makes it far less expensive, if not ultimately free, eliminating the issue of debt (your point #3).  Then, the people who can't afford med school (like myself) can apply to the government programs, creating a larger workforce, eliminating the productivity concern (your point #1).  Which leaves you holding the bag with a reduced salary (your point #2).  However, should such a socialized medicine program be put into effect, I imagine part of that stipulation would be regulate the debt still owed for medical schools under the old system, which should aid if not eliminate the staggering debt you (and others) are facing.  So, that's the ideal - socialized, government-funded and provided medicine.  This eliminates the chokehold the insurance companies have on the medical industry/market.  The reason we don't like it?  It's literally the opposite of capitalist.  You mentioned it in other responses - a lot of people become a doctor because it's lucrative.  It's the \"American Dream.\"  So while I've responded to your worries, I doubt I'll change your mind until we realise how ridiculous the \"American Dream\" is in a post-industrial world.  edit: formatting, clarification",

            " I'll start with first principles.  The purpose of a health care system is to provide health care. It is not an elaborate system to bilk people into paying welfare for people with a medical degree. If there is a need to surrender wages in order to maximise people's health, the wages should be surrendered without a second thought. That's a principle. The system serves patients, not employees.  The single payer system is dramatically better for patients. Firstly, it's much cheaper, due to the greater efficiency of a non-private system. Government don't waste people's money on advertising to convince them to use the system, for instance. In turn this means better health care for people, all else being equal. If you have less money wasted on bullshit, you have more money for health care. This is borne out in the stats. Countries with single payer are healthier. Medicare has fewer overheads than any HMO, by far.  Single payer, also, encourages people to use preventative, not emergency, health. As everyone knows, this is a winning strategy, perhaps the winning strategy, in health care policy.  Finally, single payer is much fairer than any alternative. Everyone has a right to access the best health care services that can be reasonably provided. A bankrupt fucking dole bludging heroin addict deserve gold plated health care no worse than a billionaire. This is non negotiable. If there is not the capacity to immediately provide both, it should be rationed according to need, not wealth. Only a single-payer system like Medicare will do this.  All your concerns are ridiculous, by the way. Health care workers ought to be paid what they're worth, which is apparently about half what they're paid. There is a shortage manufactured by the AMA in order to maintain this high wage; also a ban on the use of excellent, cheaper foreign doctors as a protectionist measure. We banned protection for poor people (steel workers and so on) decades ago and were right to do so (means cheaper goods for everyone among other reasons). We should do the same for rich people like doctors and lawyers and economists. This irrational AMA rent-seeking behaviour also leads to overworked doctors, by the way.",
            " >2: It will drive wages down.   It's unclear why this would be a bad thing. Clearly other countries do just fine with health care sectors with generally lower wages. I agree this would personally such for doctors, but economy-wide inefficiencies, when corrected, always annoy the people who were previously benefitting from that inefficiency. That's not a reason to prop up a bad system.  >3: All these problems will deter students from pursing medical related degrees. As you know we have a shortage of physicans in this country already.  Is there any evidence that a shortage of people in medicine is the result of insufficient number of people wanting those jobs, as opposed to a supply problem? Just open more medical schools.",
            " Regarding your first point, changing how the costs are paid doesn't necessarily mean there will be more people seeking healthcare. In fact, universal access to primary care would almost certainly reduce the load on emergency rooms.",

No one will change your mind if what you're saying is \"I don't want to be paid less,\" and it sounds like that's really all you're saying. The argument to be made for universal healthcare is that it might be a cheaper way to have better outcomes. We could talk about that if you want, but if you're just going to talk about how great we are as physicians and how we deserve to be paid the big bucks, then why even post a CMV?"

If my artwork, and marriage, and house are all accessible from the same software then my status quo will be closer to a digital existence than a physical one.  As such my access to these ideas, to my music, images, memories will all be via the metaverse as recorded on the block chain.

            " That seems pretty doubtful. A public database of rental contracts, marriage certificates, leases on cars, and mortgages hasn't been technically infeasible for some time now. Rather, it's been undesired. It is pretty difficult to come up with a single possible reason that somebody would want their mortgage to be recorded in a decentralized and public format like the blockchain. Moreover, putting things like mortgages or marriage licenses on the blockchain presents at least two disastrously bad possibilities for those records - Sybil attacks, in which a cartel of secretly cooperating verification nodes take over enough control of the network to just arbitrarily change the chain to their liking, and forks, where enough of the chain disagrees about verification for it to split into a new 'reality' for the chain. You know, imagine waking up one day to find your car lease has been transferred to somebody else because the chain hard-forked and the police are here to take your car and give it to the people who the chain says it belongs to. That seems, uh, very bad, actually",

What exactly would it mean if your car is listed in the blockchain as belonging to you? You claim it means you don't truly own the car. What makes the NFT different than the lease contract for the car?  This also supposes the laws around contracts are changed to allow NFTs as legally binding contracts, which I don't see happening any time soon.",

In fact, you seem to think this as well in some of your replies ( *\"Not too different from just a digital lease\"* ). How then will doing what we're already doing lead to a new status quo? It sounds like we're there already?  Unless you've been printing hundreds of photo-albums and live in a museum, aren't your images/memories and artworks digital now? And possibly a lot of your music too?  If we were to go back to physical ownership of music (or photo albums), for example, couldn't one argue that unless you take very, *very* good care of your CDs, Cassettes, and Records, they too are temporary? I've had a few mp3s that have lasted much, much longer than the Records or CDs.  You're also talking about an imagined future, but your future uses the *current* NFT-paradigm; I would say that by the time your consequences come true, it's possible that the NFts (or NFT-like whatevers) will have improved to address your concerns.",

            " I mean... you're not wrong that people are shifting towards owning more digital/virtual things than before. There's nothing wrong with all my family photos being digital, though... that's just a superior format for them in all ways.   There's even nothing wrong with my owning digital assets in a virtual world. I've done it before (Second Life) and it was great fun.   Where this goes off the rails is thinking that governments and people running online games are *ever* going to give up their role of being the official arbiter of ownership.   That said, it would *not* be at all unreasonable if things like deeds were basically electronic and digitally signed by the government... that would be a strict *improvement* over stuff that's just paper and maybe a potentially corruptible digital record.   But blockchain/NFTs? There's literally zero reason governments would ever use them, because they take that control out of their hands. And game writers will retain their control as well, because it gives them better profits.   Now, it's *remotely* possible some virtual services might *support* external NFTs if they get popular enough, but they will *still* retain the right to decide not to in specific cases, because, again: control over their profit centers.   Whether you think that's *good* or not is a different matter.   If you're just ignorant of what NFTs are and how they work, that could explain this disconnect. Not all digital receipts are NFTs (in fact, very few are)... if all you mean is your ownership of digital assets might be... digital, I can't really argue with that, because how else could that be?   And if all you're saying is that people will own more and more digital assets, you're not wrong about that either.   But the \"deed\" on your car or house, or other physical stuff that you need to survive as a physical being? No. There's no reason to *ever* use NFTs for that shit.   NFTs are reasonable ways for individuals to sell digital goods to individuals without the government or other middlemen being in the way and taking their cut. That's about all.

Services like Spotify and Netflix are great examples of it, but that still doesn\u2019t mean normal people will own nothing by year X.   I would argue that there\u2019s a limit to how far the subscription economy can go. It\u2019s very natural for people to prefer certainty, and nothing says certainty like actually owning a physical item. If you loose your job, you will immediately cancel many subscriptions, but you\u2019ll still get to keep your clothes, your computer, cooking pans etc. Uncertainty is so repulsive to the human mind that that people will go to great lengths to mitigate it. I can give you more examples of that, if you want.   Secondly, crypto currencies have proven that block chain technology has some serious issues which prevent widespread adaptation for the time being. This also applies to NFTs, so there\u2019s a bottle neck slowing down adaptation.  But more to the point, are NFTs a step towards an economy where everything is rented? I don\u2019t think so. I would argue that NFT-technology will find its place eventually, but it will not have a significant role until the dust settles down and the major problems get solved. Even then, the human psychology towards ownership and uncertainty is something we just can\u2019t get rid of as long as we are human.  Well, what if we tone it down a bit: \u201cCan NFTs take us a step closer to a society where we own less and rent more?\u201d (This wasn\u2019t your original argument, so apologize for that.) I don\u2019t think we need a blockchain to do that. The existing system for subscription services and renting stuff works well enough as it is. Why would we handle our subscriptions and rent contracts through a block chain, when the existing system also gets the job done?  The whole idea of a blockchain is to make sure you don\u2019t need to rely on a single authority to tell you which transactions are valid and which ones aren\u2019t. Currently we rely on banks and companies to make sure our subscriptions and contracts are the way they should be. If you don\u2019t trust your service provider, you\u2019ll switch to another more trustworthy company or sue the one you think is trying to scam you. The untrusted companies just die out in an economy like this, so there is no serious problem blockchain could potentially solve here. On the contrary, the computational demands of using this technology results in some serious environmental concerns. The benefits you get from using a blockchain might not be worth the drawbacks after all.  In summary, my argument is this: In the future people will rent more and more, but not everything. There\u2019s a hard limit on how little people are willing to own. NFTs and blockchains aren\u2019t required for taking steps in that direction, since the current system works well enough already.",
            " >soon they will point towards the lease on your car, the contract on your rent, marriage certificates -  So if you buy a Rolex you can use an NFT to prove authentication/ownership. Same goes for the car or the rent contract.  You still own the Rolex watch and the car and you still live in the apartment. Nothing in this scenario is any less physical. These things still exist, these things are still in your possession. Even more so  I would argue, because if NFTs turn into what you described they will be used to verify ownership of those material things.",

You just have different accessibility to the record that shows you didn\u2019t steal the car, you\u2019re not squatting, and you are entitled to some marriage-granted tax benefits.   If the item in question is a digital asset (like a jpeg file) is there an ownership difference dependent on whether it is recorded on the blockchain or in a Thank You email? No. There is no ownership difference, only I can\u2019t see your email, and if you delete it, there is no* way to prove it existed. But also, in this case, there was never anything physically owned to convert to digital anyway. No change.   (*yes, there are other ways, but the primary receipt for comparative purposes is gone)",

In fact, you seem to think this as well in some of your replies ( *\"Not too different from just a digital lease\"* ). How then will doing what we're already doing lead to a new status quo? It sounds like we're there already?  Unless you've been printing hundreds of photo-albums and live in a museum, aren't your images/memories and artworks digital now? And possibly a lot of your music too?  If we were to go back to physical ownership of music (or photo albums), for example, couldn't one argue that unless you take very, *very* good care of your CDs, Cassettes, and Records, they too are temporary? I've had a few mp3s that have lasted much, much longer than the Records or CDs.  You're also talking about an imagined future, but your future uses the *current* NFT-paradigm; I would say that by the time your consequences come true, it's possible that the NFts (or NFT-like whatevers) will have improved to address your concerns.",

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: we should refer to everyone by biological sex, not gender The way I see it, eliminating gendered pronouns altogether, and only using pronouns that differentiate people by their sex would make things a lot simpler and solve many problems. We could either just use \"he/him\" pronouns for males and \"she/her\" pronouns for females, or we could come up with brand new pronouns.   Some won't want to admit it, but all the different pronouns can actually be kind of confusing. I still think it sounds weird to say \"they\" in a singular sense, and with all the neopronoun stuff, that can get very complicated. Eliminating the need for all these differentiating pronouns except for two would make things much simpler.   The main counterargument against this that I can see is that people will be mis\"sexed\" (lol) all the time instead of misgendered. And yes, that would obviously be true, because it is impossible to know someone's sex for certain simply by looking at them. But, isn't it true that misidentifying a person's sex would be a lot less harmful to transgender individuals than misgendering is? If we as a society normalize referring to people by their sex only, transgender people would know that they are not actually being misgendered, because the person is simply referring to them as what they guess their biological sex to be.  I can also see the argument to eliminating either gendered/sex pronouns altogether, but people are going to want a way to classify people, especially in situations where the difference really matters.   Admittedly, I haven't thought super hard about the potential effects of this, so I could be missing something big. This was just kind of a showerthought I had, it might be dumb, but I just want to see this sub's opinions.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: I think there is nothing wrong with finding 14-17 year old girls sexually attractive, and the age of consent should universally be 15 or 16. CMV. Throwaway here because I feel like a disgusting creep. But I really find high school aged girls sexually attractive. If it were legal, I wouldn't have a moral problem with engaging in consensual sex with a 15 or 16 year old girl. No, I have never looked up jailbait shit, I would never think of touching a girl below the age of 18. I am fully aware that society frowns upon being attracted to minor teenage girls. I would never think about acting on my impulses unless it were legal and socially acceptable.   My reasoning is, biologically, we are wired to find young women sexually attractive because they have just entered the stage where they are capable of becoming pregnant and their bodies have developed to highlight their physical capabilities to birth and take care of a child (wide hips, bigger breasts). It seems entirely arbitrary to set the age of consent at 18. Why do we trust a 16 year old girl more with a car than with her own body? And what difference does it make if a 16 year old girl has sex with a 16 year old guy, a 26 year old guy or a 66 year old guy?   Am I really a pedophile for thinking this?

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: taxpayers and the general public should never contribute money in financing new sports stadiums - that should be 100% on the owner. It's no secret - owners of sports teams are usually ultra wealthy, sometimes with billions in net worth. With many local economies struggling and the poor in dire need of resources, cities and states are spending hundreds of millions helping rich owners build stadiums.  For example, Cobb county in Georgia cut off funding for local parks so it could contribute to a new stadium for the Atlanta Braves. I understand that sports teams and stadiums provide economic benefits (jobs, local shops/bars, other sales, etc.), but studies repeatedly show that the economic benefits rarely make up for these huge expenditures on stadiums.  It's a fiscally irresponsible use of limited local and state funds. If the government stops contributing to sports stadium financing, owners will still build these stadiums, and cities/states will free up hundreds of millions in tax revenue to spend where it is truly needed.\n\nAssistant:": {

If that is your only goal for funding the project, then as you say, the public shouldn't invest in them.  But tons of public projects don't reap economic benefits. Building libraries and playgrounds, managing parks, putting on parades and other public events would all have very negative cost-benefit ratios if judged the same way stadiums are. But most people would never suggest that those are all fiscally irresponsible uses of funds. They all provide similar benefits - improving the sense of community and desire to keep people engaged and living in the city.

            " The Dead Sea is what is called \"endorheic\", which means that it is a lake or other body of water that has no outputs - water flows into it, but no water flows out of it to the oceans.

Then, as that water hits the ground and flows along, it slowly picks up minerals and other substances from the ground around it. For instance, if you live in an area with a lot of limestone, the water you might get from a well is \"freshwater\" technically, but it has a lot of calcium dissolved in it, and thus it's \"hard water\" which causes scaling, etc.  Salt is something that dissolves very easily in water, and it's all over the place on Earth, so the water that flows out to the ocean slowly picks up salt, making it the salt water we know of. It took this water a very long time - billions of years, to get as salty as it is now, and in a few more billion years, it would be even more salty. This is because, as the water evaporates from the ocean - the second half of the water cycle - it leaves that salt behind, forming that pure H2O that condensed back into rain.

The Dead Sea, because it is endorheic, has this happen on a much much faster timescale. Water flows in with salt in it, the water in the lake gets saltier, water evaporates leaving the salt behind, and the cycle repeats. But because the lake is so much smaller than the ocean, this happens much quicker, leaving a much saltier lake than the oceans where all that salt has more water to dilute it in.  This has also accelerated in recent (last few hundred) years, as more water is taken from the Jordan river, the main source of the Dead Sea, for irrigation purposes. So the water level of the Dead Sea keeps dropping as more water evaporates and less water comes in, but the same amount of salt is still there, so the amount of salt in any given amount of water is increasing even faster than it would naturally.  If the Dead Sea were to suddenly have a river sprout out of it and go to the ocean (ignoring for a moment that it's ~430 meters below sea level, so the ocean would flow in not the Dead Sea flow out), the salt would gradually be diluted in the billions and billions of litres of ocean water, and the overall salt content there would be, effectively, unchanged.

A lot can change about an accent in 100 years. And that's important, because even when the US first broke away, the colonies had been around for some 200 years. Especially without mass telecommunications to keep people closely connected even when they were geographically isolated, the cultures diverged, and with them, the accents.

            " Your underlying premise that the \"English accent\" went somewhere is false. The modern British accent has something which is called \"non-rhoticity\"; basically they lost most of their R's and don't pronounce them. \"Water\" for example would be pronounced \"wah-uh\" in a modern British accent, but Americans did not take on this change to the British pronunciation in the 18th century.

            " American English and British English diverged a good while ago, and have since gone their separate ways. Different American dialects (including General American) show features that were unique to where in the British Isles they came from; these may have been lost or overwritten since in the UK. Modern mainstream British English is much more innovative than modern General American English, actually.  Appalachian English is one of the most conservative dialects of English still spoken, and sounds much more like English on both sides of the pond during the 1700s than either General American or your average modern Southern England English.  > I'm assuming the typical NY accent comes from Italians coming over.  There is a bit of Italian influence, but almost all of it is a mix of changes that had already happened in England when it was brought over (e.g. the r-loss) and natural language change.  > Why are there no places in the US at all that kept the English accents????  There are places that brought over innovations we associate with England. Parts of the US South and New England have the same r-loss change as much of England and Oceania, though in the US this is a stigmatised pronunciation and has been receding as people try to sound more like more educated and wealthier Americans. The same change is expanding in the UK as people try to sound more like more educated and wealthier Englishmen.   (Fun fact, pronunciations like *warsh* for *wash* are hypercorrections due to speakers who have this change not knowing where to revert it and where it was never there at all!)",

The modern \"standard\" American accent emerged in the post-war period, as television networks preferentially hired broadcasters from the Midwest. This more authentic, ostensibly more patriotic, \"American heartland\" way of speaking contrasted with the more affected mid-Atlantic accent that was used in film and radio before WWII.  The American West was a relatively newly colonized area, so it didn't have established local accents to the degree that regions in the East did. As a result, the \"standard\" American accent more quickly took hold in the West compared to the South or Northeast. Later regional subcultures like hippies, surfers, and valley girls led to the development of the modern California accent.",

            " There is an actual reason that I don't see here but I'm late to the party!  As people have said previously, hairs grow from follicles, inside your skin. Some do indeed grow forever, like your head hair (if you're lucky.) They age and fall out due to a lot of different reasons including what you eat and how healthy you are.  Hairs that don't grow forever get their length determined in the genes of the cells in the follicle. But how do they sense their length?  Longer hairs wiggle! Cells in the follicle can sense mechanical stress as well as grow hairs.  Say we talk about a hair in your leg, just above your ankle.  As it grows, moving in life causes it to wiggle a certain amount. Just a little bit at first.  Then as it gets longer it's more likely to catch air currents,  rub on things,  and get pulled more.  The follicle knows how much wiggle is associated with how long the hair is. If it wiggles just a little it'll hang on to the hair.  If it wiggles to much it stops growing the hair and may even let it go after a certain amount of time.  Incidentally you can see this work,  especially around the ankle when people wear socks for a long time. The constant movement of the sock on the ankle can sometimes make hair growth finer or even stop it entirely.  This happens in athletes.  Now on the other side of the spectrum,  people that wear socks for to long but don't move, say when they're in a coma, usually grow very long ankle hairs because there is no wiggle.  **Update:** TLDR at the bottom. I am so excited to see all the interest in my answer for why we have funny hairs! I came back to see a number of comments expanding upon my explanation, but also some that rightfully sought further explanation, hopefully with evidence based research. After about 10 hours of intensive investigation (this covid thing has done weird things to me) I've come up with a couple points that may or may not be of interest. I thought I'd break it into different contents.  1. **As a Human Journey:** I swear to God I thought I had it right. I was honestly surprised that I didn't see the obvious only right answer posted here. I *knew* I learned about this in histology. Absolutely *knew* without any doubt at all. As a result I wrote it up without second guessing. I didn't include sources and didn't double check anything afterwards. Everyone, be careful what you think you *know*. I'm a pretty educated person but I'm not always right. The worst is embarking on a 10 hour research quest through available literature to *make* myself right. At the very least I was hoping I'd be able to absolve myself of totally making something up. I still don't really know if I did but suffice to say I can't find where I came up with this explanation as I described it. I swear I've know the \"wiggle\" explanation for years. Weird, but okay.  *Mea culpa* for sure. Bs can happen to (or be made up by) the best of us. Lastly, I absolutely loved hearing all the anecdotes and appreciate the interest in just a Explain like I'm five years old. I'm so glad I learned about people's watches, toes, wizard eyebrows, and pooping habits. 2. **As a Scientist:** Always include sources where you are able, especially if you endeavor to teach others. u/Darthskull and u/marklein had exactly the right idea. That being said, no one who believed my explanation at face value should feel like a bad scientist. It's still a kick ass explanation that appears to have testable effects. It is a pretty neat hypothesis for sure. Buuuuuut I guess it hasn't been tested specifically. I'll get to that below. Early moral is to be careful quickly accepting explanations that sound like the right answer immediately. Late lesson is again that I went searching in order to prove my hypothesis correct when I was called on it. That is so, so dangerous in science. We cannot look for articles and information that tell us what we want to hear. This applies in every aspect of life but especially in science.  Find your data, interpret it, then decide what you think. Any other order carries with it the potential for misunderstanding, bias, and concerning inaccuracies. After albeit too much research, the last moral may turn out to be that not all BS is worthless. Some of the best ideas come from the nugget of ~~corn~~ truth yielded by BS. I do think there is potential for actual honest to God real scientific testing. 3. **As a Brand New Hair Researcher:** (This is decidedly **not** Explain like I'm five years old and requires some pretty good foundational biochem. Also a good handle of other top answers.) Many of the other answers in this thread have indicated or hinted at where the current body of research regarding hair growth has brought us. Hair growth science is of particular interest to experts in evolutionary biology, pharmaceuticals, and nearly every field of medicine, from dermatology to oncology. That being said there is a huge amount that is not known. I think I still might be wrong, but there's a chance in all that vague \"black box\" process \"wiggle theory\" might come out okay.  As many have stated (and copy and pasted \\only throwing gentle shade\\]), the most generally accepted and well tested explanation for OP's original question entails a temporally limited cell cycling within the follicle. Anagen, Catagen, and Telogen have been measured numerous times in both in vitro and in vivo models. They appear relatively stable within individual follicles. The length of these cycles and, by extension, the general growth of the hair can be altered appropriately based upon physiologic need at initial cell line differentiation. These are frequently geographic distributions. These basic blueprints would be subject to varying biochemical marker gradients and gene expression.  [Hair Cycle Clock. Follicular Cell Cycling  Both hormonal regulation as well as localized gene expression can alter the length of the anagen stage in particular. Otherwise, these stages progress rather autonomously with or without extrinsic stimuli. From what we can tell, differing hair types, and likely their maximum lengths become set. As we age or undergo stress, there can be measurable and dramatic changes in the cycling time but there isn't an indication that there is significant plasticity due to extrinsic stimuli on the follicle itself. MAYBE.  So many aspects of localized cellular behaviors are dictated by biochemical milieu and equilibrium it would be nigh impossible to exclude cytokine and chemotactic processes from affecting follicles. The oft attributed TNF, TGF, and FGF may play a large role in actually causing cycling but, hell, they play a large role in a lot of things. What can be said is that at some point anagen activation must outweigh inhibitory mechanisms lest catagen begin and the follicle begins to atrophy.  We don't know what stimuli could cause increases in localized biochemical inhibitors. Some may prove to be tactile in nature, but it has not been characterized as of yet. Could repeated abrasion from a sock, or continued tensile stress influence follicular cell cycling? Could be. This would have to be distinctly different than previously characterized pathology (traction allopecia, Stress induced hair loss, etc). This would have to be physiology! This would be characterized as extrafollicular skin signalling. There is obvious indication that this does exist but again seems to affect larger regions or groups of follicles rather than individual follicles. Again, there does not appear to be an intrafollicular process for this known at this time.  CONTINUED IN REPLY  TLDR: I accidentally thought this was an easy question that I could easily answer, and did. Turns out everyone was right to question my answer despite other seemingly promising anecdotal applications and ostensibly sound reasoning. I didn't have the data or the research to back it up. I researched for 10 hours through primary literature review in an effort to find out where I came up with it and maybe to make me right. Probably am not right but learned a lot about hair. The other answers represent the most widely accepted explanations.",

As many have stated (and copy and pasted \\only throwing gentle shade\\]), the most generally accepted and well tested explanation for OP's original question entails a temporally limited cell cycling within the follicle. Anagen, Catagen, and Telogen have been measured numerous times in both in vitro and in vivo models. They appear relatively stable within individual follicles. The length of these cycles and, by extension, the general growth of the hair can be altered appropriately based upon physiologic need at initial cell line differentiation. These are frequently geographic distributions. These basic blueprints would be subject to varying biochemical marker gradients and gene expression.  [Hair Cycle Clock. Follicular Cell Cycling  Both hormonal regulation as well as localized gene expression can alter the length of the anagen stage in particular. Otherwise, these stages progress rather autonomously with or without extrinsic stimuli. From what we can tell, differing hair types, and likely their maximum lengths become set. As we age or undergo stress, there can be measurable and dramatic changes in the cycling time but there isn't an indication that there is significant plasticity due to extrinsic stimuli on the follicle itself. MAYBE.  So many aspects of localized cellular behaviors are dictated by biochemical milieu and equilibrium it would be nigh impossible to exclude cytokine and chemotactic processes from affecting follicles. The oft attributed TNF, TGF, and FGF may play a large role in actually causing cycling but, hell, they play a large role in a lot of things. What can be said is that at some point anagen activation must outweigh inhibitory mechanisms lest catagen begin and the follicle begins to atrophy.  We don't know what stimuli could cause increases in localized biochemical inhibitors. Some may prove to be tactile in nature, but it has not been characterized as of yet. Could repeated abrasion from a sock, or continued tensile stress influence follicular cell cycling? Could be. This would have to be distinctly different than previously characterized pathology (traction allopecia, Stress induced hair loss, etc). This would have to be physiology! This would be characterized as extrafollicular skin signalling. There is obvious indication that this does exist but again seems to affect larger regions or groups of follicles rather than individual follicles.

            " Asked and answered in 2015: Actually, all hair stops growing after a certain length! Leg hair, arm hair, eyelashes, eyebrows, head hair, and even the hair on your butt will stop growing after a certain period of time. Exactly how long your hair can grow depends primarily on your genetics, but age, hormones, and general health can all play a part.  Hair growth occurs in three phases. The first phase is called the anagen phase and it is during this time that the hair actually grows. About 85% of the hair on your head is in this phase at any given time. This phase can last between two and six years for head hair and the duration of this phase will determine just how fast and how long your hair can grow.  The second phase is the catagen phase. During this phase, the hair follicle separates from the hair strand itself and does some things to prepare itself for the next phase.  The third phase is called the telogen phase and it's known as the resting phase. Around 15% of your hairs will be in this phase at any given moment. Once this phase is over, the cycle begins anew with the anagen phase.  You can read more about Human hair growth at Wikipedia. Take a look at the sidebar for information about the different kinds of hair, too!  It has been five years since I've had my head hair last cut and it's stopped growing about mid-way down my back. That's a pretty typical length for males. Female hair tends to stop somewhere around the buttocks.",
            " There is an actual reason that I don't see here but I'm late to the party!  As people have said previously, hairs grow from follicles, inside your skin. Some do indeed grow forever, like your head hair (if you're lucky.) They age and fall out due to a lot of different reasons including what you eat and how healthy you are.  Hairs that don't grow forever get their length determined in the genes of the cells in the follicle. But how do they sense their length?  Longer hairs wiggle! Cells in the follicle can sense mechanical stress as well as grow hairs.  Say we talk about a hair in your leg, just above your ankle.  As it grows, moving in life causes it to wiggle a certain amount. Just a little bit at first.  Then as it gets longer it's more likely to catch air currents,  rub on things,  and get pulled more.  The follicle knows how much wiggle is associated with how long the hair is. If it wiggles just a little it'll hang on to the hair.  If it wiggles to much it stops growing the hair and may even let it go after a certain amount of time.  Incidentally you can see this work,  especially around the ankle when people wear socks for a long time. The constant movement of the sock on the ankle can sometimes make hair growth finer or even stop it entirely.  This happens in athletes.  Now on the other side of the spectrum,  people that wear socks for to long but don't move, say when they're in a coma, usually grow very long ankle hairs because there is no wiggle.  **Update:** TLDR at the bottom. I am so excited to see all the interest in my answer for why we have funny hairs! I came back to see a number of comments expanding upon my explanation, but also some that rightfully sought further explanation, hopefully with evidence based research.

            " Immuno-oncologist; I will try to make it as basic as I can but realize there are millions of minor facts that fit in the middle of this broad overview.  First off it is important to understand cells. Cells are the ultimate team players. They are programmed to kill themselves if there is something wrong with them and they are able to start the cycle of killing themselves. If they don't grow up correctly, if they aren't doing their job properly and when they get too old; boom suicide. This is called apoptosis. What is also important about cells it to realize that they communicate with their environment and their fellow cells all the time with chemicals. Next it is important to know that cells also have receptors on their surfaces that allow them to communicate as well. Some of these receptors are specific in that that have a \"don't kill me\" sign. There are actually sometimes dozens of \"don't kill me\" signs that they can have. Last, it is important to know that cells can, when damaged in the right way not kill themselves and they can also get screwy in their signs and display \"don't kill me\" even if they really need to be killed. Those abnormal cells will still divide as normal if they have the ability to do so and the two cells that come from it will be identical to the first one. So one abnormal cell is now 2 identical abnormal cells. That process can repeat forever in a living organism. This is essentially that clump of cells you are referring to. Often these cells were all from the same parent cell, we call them clonal (from one colony).  Next its important to realize that there are factors outside of random chance that can increase the odds of making a lot of very bad abnormal cells. Some of those include UV and chemicals like those found in cigarettes or asbestos etc.  Next, the last major player to avoid absolute catastrophe is the immune system.  Your immune system is amazing but it has limits. Your immune system functions a bit like the police of a dystopian state. They kill everything is foreign, everything that is not functioning properly (e.g. growing too fast or eating too much) and everything that is sick (e.g. virus infected). But I mentioned those \"don't kill me\" signs that cells can have. Those are normal signs but abnormal cells can show them even if they should be killed.  This means that your last natural chance to kill bad cells can miss them.  Finally, it is important to realize that this is also a numbers game. The sheer number of cells in your body and their crazy number of things about them that are different depending on where they are (think stomach vs skin vs brain), what they normally do and at what age, sex or random genetic mutations you have makes this whole system seem impossible to alter at our choosing. For reference a billion cells fit inside the tip of an adult pinky.  The field of immuno-oncology (cancer immunotherapy) cropped up hoping to hijack this system but its been a rough field to find success. We learn more and more that cells have so many ways to tell the immune system to leave them alone. We think we find that a breast cancer has a lot of one sign and we make a drug against it and more of other signs come up in its place. Some of it is basic chance and some of survival by mutation. The more mutations that are made the more likely abnormal cells proliferate. Cancerous chemicals and UV increase that mutational burden and really hurts your bodies natural ability to kill abnormal cells. Essentially this is how we get cancerous cells and when enough of those cells exist, the normal functions of whatever organ they are in goes down and we will eventually succumb to them. So in the instance of cigarettes, our lungs, esophagus and circulatory systems are all sensitive and we cant live without breathing and having oxygen passed around inside our body."

            " It's interesting. I've never really given it much thought, but after some research, this is an excerpt from what I've found:  \"If we can agree that a negative number is just a positive number multiplied by -1, then we can always write the product of two negative numbers this way:     (-a)(-b) = (-1)(a)(-1)(b) = (-1)(-1)ab   For example,      -2 * -3 = (-1)(2)(-1)(3)               = (-1)(-1)(2)(3)              = (-1)(-1) * 6  So the real question is,     (-1)(-1) = ?  and the answer is that the following convention has been adopted:     (-1)(-1) = +1  This convention has been adopted for the simple reason that any other convention would cause something to break.  For example, if we adopted the convention that (-1)(-1) = -1, the distributive property of multiplication wouldn't work for negative numbers:     (-1)(1 + -1) = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) \t         (-1)(0) = -1 + -1                0 = -2  As Sherlock Holmes observed, \"When you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\"  Since everything except +1 can be excluded as impossible, it follows that, however improbable it seems, (-1)(-1) = +1.\"  You can read the whole explanation here: http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.negxneg.html  TLDR: We do it because not doing it would cause math to break.",
            " It's an inevitable consequence of the distributive law.  0 = 0x = (1 + -1)x = 1x + (-1)x = x + (-1)x  So when x = -1, we have that 0 = -1 + (-1)(-1). Therefore, (-1)(-1) = 1.  This extends to other numbers: (-a)(-b) = (-1)a(-1)b = (-1)(-1)ab = ab",

Multiplying by -1 is like rotating the car 180 degrees causing you to drive into the negative territory.  Reversing your direction twice causes you to rotate 180+180=360 degrees, causing you to face the original direction.  This example works well when you introduce complex numbers.  Rather than thinking of *i* as the square root of -1, think of it as a rotation of 90 degrees.  Multiplying by *i* causes you to turn 90 degrees, and -*i* causes you to turn 90+180=270 degrees.

            " In short, two negatives make a positive in multiplication because one of the properties of negation and multiplication is that negative one multiplied by negative one is equal to positive one. This is not a particularly satisfying answer, so I will attempt to explain the reasoning behind this property (as I understand it).  First of all, the negation of a number *x* is such that the negation of *x* plus *x* is equal to 0.   For example: (-5) + 5 = 0, that is, the negation of 5 is -5.  The negation of a number is also known as the *additive inverse* of a number.  One of the standard properties of multiplication (for real and complex numbers. That is: natural numbers, integers, and fractions) is that a number multiplied by negative one (-1) is equal to the additive inverse of that number.   Therefore: (5).(-1) = (-5)  And, the additive inverse of negative one is one, so: (-1).(-1) = 1  If we understand that negative one multiplied by negative one is equal to one, then it follows that multiplication of any two negative numbers will be equal to a positive number.  For example:   (-a).(-b)=(-1).a.(-1).b=(-1).(-1).a.b=(1).a.b.=a.b  It is possible that confusion over why two negatives make a positive in multiplication may be due to multiplication being taught through analogies such as repeated addition. (Which works fine for simple calculations but possibly raises conceptual problems with understanding multiplication later on.)  **TLDR:** Two negatives make a positive because that is one of the properties of negation and multiplication.",

            " The simplest way to think of it is probably direction. If you're going east 5 meters, and then you go west 2 meters, you end up 3 meters to the east of where you started (5-2=3). So you can define \"east\" as \"positive\" and \"west\" as \"negative\" in this scenario, and going a negative direction is turning around and moving forward.  Now what happens if you do that twice? If -(5 meters east) is 5 meters west, then -(- 5 meters east) is -(5 meters west) = 5 meters east.   If you're going 3 times -2 meters east, you're going 3 x 2 meters west. You can also multiply the opposite way; going 2 meters east -3 times, or going the opposite direction of 2 meters east 3 times. Same result.

            " In short, two negatives make a positive in multiplication because one of the properties of negation and multiplication is that negative one multiplied by negative one is equal to positive one. This is not a particularly satisfying answer, so I will attempt to explain the reasoning behind this property (as I understand it).  First of all, the negation of a number *x* is such that the negation of *x* plus *x* is equal to 0.   For example: (-5) + 5 = 0, that is, the negation of 5 is -5.  The negation of a number is also known as the *additive inverse* of a number.  One of the standard properties of multiplication (for real and complex numbers. That is: natural numbers, integers, and fractions) is that a number multiplied by negative one (-1) is equal to the additive inverse of that number.   Therefore: (5).(-1) = (-5)  And, the additive inverse of negative one is one, so: (-1).(-1) = 1  If we understand that negative one multiplied by negative one is equal to one, then it follows that multiplication of any two negative numbers will be equal to a positive number.  For example:   (-a).(-b)=(-1).a.(-1).b=(-1).(-1).a.b=(1).a.b.=a.b  It is possible that confusion over why two negatives make a positive in multiplication may be due to multiplication being taught through analogies such as repeated addition.

            " It's kinda self-perpetuating. The economy grows because our whole economy is built around the idea of growth. We borrow against the future in the expectation of better returns, we invest in the future in the expectation of future gains.  And within this system, individuals demand growth. Would you like to get a pay rise next year?  Where's that money/stuff/welfare going to come from? Either from growth (more money available), or from redistribution (taking from one to give to another) - with the obvious snag that redistribution means someone else has to have less money/stuff/welfare. So growth in the economy enables growth in individual wealth, welfare, and lifestyles. Lack of growth means stagnation. Recession means falling living standards.  This is all putting aside the population size point, which I think is actually incidental to the point. Even with a stagnant population, you would still need growth for the above reasons.  Now, it's possible to imagine a post-growth economy but it's pretty hard. There are big conversations around de-growthing the economy because infinite growth implies infinite consumption of resources, and we ain't got infinite resources. It sort of shakes the very foundation of how everything works.",

            " There are probably several answers to this question, but there are two things I think contribute.   First is that our population is growing (albeit very slowly in the US as of late), so that\u2019s one reason we\u2019d like the economy to grow.   More importantly, the growth of the economy is one factor that helps drive investments. If the economy didn\u2019t grow (meaning most companies don\u2019t generate net new value for their shareholders), then investors have effectively lost money. This is because the money that they invested in a company (which has not earned additional value for a whole year) could have been sitting in a savings account or invested in government bonds and accruing interest (creating additional value). This would disincentivize people from investing in companies, which is generally bad for job growth / employment rate / innovation / etc if companies have less funding and aren\u2019t generating additional revenue themselves.

            " I realize there is a rule against opinions, but this is an inherently political question. Every answer to this question will be an opinion tarnished by the commenter's political ideology.  The economy doesn't require constant growth, capitalism does. The economy could refer to a whole lot of things, all generally relating to production, distribution, and consumption of goods. Capitalism isn't the economy, it's a type of economy, and it does require constant growth. This is because capitalists are constantly hoarding / isolating wealth from the working population.  edit: correction, capitalism isn't a type of economy, it's a mode of production. My bad.  As they take more, we need to produce more to compensate. But in doing so, we make the total amount of stuff bigger. So next time they take more, it'll be more more than last time's more. Capitalism makes no effort to meet people's needs, it's all about making profits for the capitalist. A system designed to meet people's needs would not require such a constant and massive growth.",

            " We use visible light and radio in different ways \u2014 not because they behave differently, but just because.  We use visible light to transmit coherent images. That means there are many different \"beams\" of light at different wavelengths, all packed close together and moving in parallel. To receive the image, we need to capture _all_ the beams at the same time. So we use a bunch of small light sensors packed into an area. This is exactly what our eyes and cameras do \u2014 the lens focuses the light (bends the beams) so it lands onto an array of sensors.  We use radio to transmit broadcasts. That means we only have one signal and we send it on _many_ \"beams\" in _all directions_. Since every beam is a copy of all the others, we just need to pick out one of them to receive the whole signal. So the antenna essentially takes a \"slice\" of the radio going by.  There's no reason we _couldn't_ send a coherent image of radio. But the sensors in our eyes can't receive in the radio wavelengths, so we've never had a compelling reason to do so. And we can send broadcasts using visible light. Imagine a lightbulb pulsing different colors in a dark room \u2014 you could check the wavelength of any passing beam to get the signal. But outside a dark room there's so much visible light that the broadcast would have to be *blinding* to be picked out against the background light. Since we can't perceive radio directly we can transmit \"blinding\" (high amplitude) radio without hurting anyone.  So the photoreceptors in our eyes and cameras need to be small, because we need to pack a bunch together to receive an image spread out over an area, and the smaller the receptors the more detail we can pick out. Ideally each receptor would pick out one beam.  Antennas are long for exactly the opposite reason. We *want* to collect a whole bunch of beams at once \u2014 since all the beams of the broadcast are the same, it means the combined signal will be \"louder\" against the background noise (all of the other radio that isn't part of the broadcast).",

That Parts too complicated to do an eli5 explanation.",
            " The modern atomic model is the result of about 70 years of many different attempts to understand the nature of atoms. The basic approaches involved people a) speculating about how they _might_ work (theory) and b) doing experiments that would either confirm or deny some of these speculations, or give information that could prompt more speculations (experiment). Sometimes theory went first, sometimes experiment went first, but the back-and-forth was how they figured it out.  For example. The idea of atoms \u2014\u00a0of there being \"units\" of chemistry \u2014 became popular in the 18th century as part of the Chemical Revolution. It was a very useful way to understand how chemical reactions worked. But nobody had much of an idea of what these atoms _were_ other than a way to understand chemistry. So you could say, if I have some atoms of hydrogen and some atoms of oxygen and I subject them to a spark, it will cause a (pretty violent) reaction that will end up with water, which is made of both hydrogen and oxygen somehow merged together.   There was a scientist named William Prout who in the early 19th century basically said, I bet that the difference between a hydrogen atom and an oxygen atom is related to them being made out of different amounts of the same stuff. That is, that atoms were themselves made of pieces (\"subatomic particles\"), and that hydrogen might have some number of these and oxygen might have another number. Prout theorized that there was only one type of subatomic particle.   Later in the century, an experimental physicist, J.J. Thomson, became interested in weird \"rays\" that seemed to be produced through experimental devices called cathode ray tubes (the same kinds of tubes that made old TVs work). People had already discovered, sort of through tinkering, that if you passed an electric current through a vacuum in the right way, it made some kind of rays come out the other side that could be detected with the right equipment. But nobody knew why this worked or what the rays were.   Thomson said, ah, let's study the rays and see (based on a hypothesis) if they might be something like Prout's hypothetical subatomic particle! So he did some very careful observations that proved that the rays coming out were tiny particles with strong electric charges that could be bent by a magnet. He declared that what was happening in a cathode ray tube is that it was breaking down atoms into their subatomic pieces, and what was being shot through them was a Proutian particle that Thomson dubbed the corpuscle. Everybody thought that was a dumb name and used \"electron\" instead.   To accompany this idea, Thomson suggested that maybe atoms were just big lumps of electrons that were somehow all rotating around each other. A single atom might have hundreds of electrons in it in Thomson's model. This, he argued, explained the cathode ray tubes, and also explained (in its own way) the link between matter and electricity.  Cool idea, said other scientists, but they were never totally sold on it. Ernest Rutherford and his students tried an experiment to see if atoms worked the way Thomson thought. They used a source of alpha radiation (which had been recently discovered, but itself not understood) to shoot particles through a very thin foil of gold. If Thomson was right, and atoms were composed of just a bunch of swirling little electrons, the alpha particle (which was a positively-charged, relatively large particle) should just fly right through them. And most of them did fly right through. But some of them got reflected backwards at a very sharp angle. It is\u00a0sort of like what would happen if you through a tennis ball at a single metal pole: most of the time you'd miss, but if you hit the pole, it'd bounce right back at you.

            " Rutherford directed alpha particles from a decaying radioactive material to a piece of foil and observed the way in which these particles reflected and scattered. The only way the particular scattering made sense was if almost all the atomic matter was concentrated in a tiny volume situated at the atome center, the atomic nucleus.

            " The modern atomic model is the result of about 70 years of many different attempts to understand the nature of atoms. The basic approaches involved people a) speculating about how they _might_ work (theory) and b) doing experiments that would either confirm or deny some of these speculations, or give information that could prompt more speculations (experiment). Sometimes theory went first, sometimes experiment went first, but the back-and-forth was how they figured it out.  For example. The idea of atoms \u2014\u00a0of there being \"units\" of chemistry \u2014 became popular in the 18th century as part of the Chemical Revolution. It was a very useful way to understand how chemical reactions worked. But nobody had much of an idea of what these atoms _were_ other than a way to understand chemistry. So you could say, if I have some atoms of hydrogen and some atoms of oxygen and I subject them to a spark, it will cause a (pretty violent) reaction that will end up with water, which is made of both hydrogen and oxygen somehow merged together.   There was a scientist named William Prout who in the early 19th century basically said, I bet that the difference between a hydrogen atom and an oxygen atom is related to them being made out of different amounts of the same stuff. That is, that atoms were themselves made of pieces (\"subatomic particles\"), and that hydrogen might have some number of these and oxygen might have another number. Prout theorized that there was only one type of subatomic particle.   Later in the century, an experimental physicist, J.J. Thomson, became interested in weird \"rays\" that seemed to be produced through experimental devices called cathode ray tubes (the same kinds of tubes that made old TVs work). People had already discovered, sort of through tinkering, that if you passed an electric current through a vacuum in the right way, it made some kind of rays come out the other side that could be detected with the right equipment. But nobody knew why this worked or what the rays were.   Thomson said, ah, let's study the rays and see (based on a hypothesis) if they might be something like Prout's hypothetical subatomic particle! So he did some very careful observations that proved that the rays coming out were tiny particles with strong electric charges that could be bent by a magnet. He declared that what was happening in a cathode ray tube is that it was breaking down atoms into their subatomic pieces, and what was being shot through them was a Proutian particle that Thomson dubbed the corpuscle. Everybody thought that was a dumb name and used \"electron\" instead.   To accompany this idea, Thomson suggested that maybe atoms were just big lumps of electrons that were somehow all rotating around each other. A single atom might have hundreds of electrons in it in Thomson's model. This, he argued, explained the cathode ray tubes, and also explained (in its own way) the link between matter and electricity.  Cool idea, said other scientists, but they were never totally sold on it. Ernest Rutherford and his students tried an experiment to see if atoms worked the way Thomson thought. They used a source of alpha radiation (which had been recently discovered, but itself not understood) to shoot particles through a very thin foil of gold. If Thomson was right, and atoms were composed of just a bunch of swirling little electrons, the alpha particle (which was a positively-charged, relatively large particle) should just fly right through them. And most of them did fly right through. But some of them got reflected backwards at a very sharp angle. It is\u00a0sort of like what would happen if you through a tennis ball at a single metal pole: most of the time you'd miss, but if you hit the pole, it'd bounce right back at you. (How'd they \"see\" these particles? They had a setup by which they could tell how many particles hit a detector, basically, so they could just count the \"hits\" and where they were.)

For the first time ever today, he told me of times when his depression had been so bad that he considered suicide. Of course, this upset me... but if I'm quite honest, I don't really understand the whole 'depression' thing.   Personally, I have never had issues with depression. I've dealt with the standard negative aspects of life that most people go through such as grief, bereavement, stress, illness, financial struggles etc. but for me, it has never been more than a few days/weeks of gloominess before I'm back to my old self.

            " Well actually 88% is not that bad. You can't do stairs, but you'll live. The problem is when it start to fall under 80%. And still, you won't suffer serious damage, especially if the saturation decreased slowly, giving your body time to adapt (your brain especially). But you were asking why: your brain consume A LOT of oxygen to work properly. Saturation is actually the percentage of haemoglobin saturated with oxygen. Saturation multiplied by haemoglobin concentration results your oxygen delivery capability. If it drops suddenly your brain \"panics\" and demand more by increasing ventilation. If ventilation is already maximal you'll start feel dizzy and then you blackout. But if it falls slowly (days, like in covid patients) your brain has time to increase the blood flow and oxygen extraction, so even if there is less oxygen per unit of blood the total amount delivered stays acceptable. I've seen covid patient arriving in the ER with a periferical saturation of 50%, and they were perfectly awake and not even confused or dizzy. Can it stay that low for long? No. Even if your brain can adapt, there is another organ that can't: your heart. In normal condition your heart extract all the possible oxygen from haemoglobin (for the rest of your body it's not like this, oxygen extraction can increase from the usual 20% to 70-80%). If it requires more oxygen, the only thing it can do is increase blood flow through coronary arthery. When saturation falls too low (there isn't an equal percentage for everyone, it varies for age, pathology, etc) and blood flow can't go higher, your cardiac muscle starts to die. If the situation isn't reverted quickly, it becomes a discrepancy heart attack. Usually death rapidly ensues.",

Oxygen is replenished and transferred to blood cells in the lungs, then blood cells travel to the rest of the body and release the oxygen for other cells to use. HOWEVER, the blood cells normally don't actually release 100% oxygen before they make it back to the lung. Here's a illustration showing roughly that while it varies, even under intense exercise the blood cells still hold on to 35% of the oxygen. That means under typical situations you only have access to 65% of max oxygen pool in your blood. Now that is extremely simplified to the point where I should add caveats but you should get the general idea that that 7% difference is much closer to 11%, and any further drop in O2 is actually a larger impact than the flat % would suggest.",

            " Blood oxygen level is measuring the capacity of your blood to carry oxygen to your cells.  Low oxygen to cells means they start dying which affects all the functions of your body. Also low oxygen level means the poisonous CO2 levels start increasing as the body is basically unable to release its toxins (similar to how a kidney failure will kill you due to the toxins accumulating in your blood).

If 1 out of 9 teachers call out sick, there are not enough substitutes. Some of the administration like assistant principals have to step in. This prevents them from doing their normal tasks.

            " What's missing so far in these explanations is a non-Explain like I'm five years old thing, which is oxygen partial pressure.  I'll take a stab at it.  Warning: non-Explain like I'm five years old, but necessary.  Partial pressure is the pressure of a particular gas within a mixture of gases.  Add up the partial pressures of all the gases in a mixture of gases, and you get the total pressure.  The partial pressure of oxygen being delivered to the various tissues of our bodies is what's important.  Too low of a partial pressure will slow down the electron transport chain reactions in our mitochondria, which is where we get the majority of our energy.  Hemoglobin is interesting in this regard.  The partial pressure of oxygen that is bound to the hemoglobin molecule does not change in a linear fashion with percent saturation.  Check out this curve showing the relationship between oxygen partial pressure and percent saturation of hemoglobin:  https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image?imageKey=HEME%2F81216  Concentrate on the black line, not the dotted lines on the graph.  You'll notice that a percent saturation of 88%, the partial pressure of oxygen on those hemoglobin molecules is about 59 mm Hg (Hg = mercury, mm of Hg being a measurement standard for pressure).  However, at 95% saturation, the PPO2 is is 75.  59 is not so terrible; your body can do pretty much OK, but if you're on your way down because of a developing problem in your lungs, see what you get when you drop to 75% oxygen saturation (40 mm Hg).  This spot is marked on the graph with some black lines.  This is the typical oxygen concentration for blood in your veins, after it has dropped off the usual amount of oxygen.  But now, with your 75% oxygen concentration, this is what's happening in your arteries.  Where the blood is supposed to be oxygen rich.  Your body won't be happy with that.  Those hemoglobin molecules will arrive at the tissues where they unload their oxygen and can only provide oxygen at a partial pressure of 40 mm Hg.  This rapid fall-off in partial pressure is reflected in the steep part of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve.  Explain like I'm five years old part, mostly: So the way it works is: something is preventing oxygen from getting into the bloodstream in your lungs, resulting in lower percent saturation.  Maybe this is pneumonia.  Maybe this is because you went to the Himalayas are at high altitude.  The hemoglobin in the blood leaving the lungs now is under-saturated, and the oxygen it is carrying get to the tissues and unloads that oxygen, but at a lower partial pressure than is needed to run your mitochondria energy factory adequately, and you are doing worse.  How much worse depends on how much that partial pressure has dropped.",

            " Well actually 88% is not that bad. You can't do stairs, but you'll live. The problem is when it start to fall under 80%. And still, you won't suffer serious damage, especially if the saturation decreased slowly, giving your body time to adapt (your brain especially). But you were asking why: your brain consume A LOT of oxygen to work properly. Saturation is actually the percentage of haemoglobin saturated with oxygen. Saturation multiplied by haemoglobin concentration results your oxygen delivery capability. If it drops suddenly your brain \"panics\" and demand more by increasing ventilation. If ventilation is already maximal you'll start feel dizzy and then you blackout. But if it falls slowly (days, like in covid patients) your brain has time to increase the blood flow and oxygen extraction, so even if there is less oxygen per unit of blood the total amount delivered stays acceptable. I've seen covid patient arriving in the ER with a periferical saturation of 50%, and they were perfectly awake and not even confused or dizzy. Can it stay that low for long? No. Even if your brain can adapt, there is another organ that can't: your heart. In normal condition your heart extract all the possible oxygen from haemoglobin (for the rest of your body it's not like this, oxygen extraction can increase from the usual 20% to 70-80%). If it requires more oxygen, the only thing it can do is increase blood flow through coronary arthery. When saturation falls too low (there isn't an equal percentage for everyone, it varies for age, pathology, etc) and blood flow can't go higher, your cardiac muscle starts to die. If the situation isn't reverted quickly, it becomes a discrepancy heart attack. Usually death rapidly ensues."

        "sft_target": " Others have already addressed the main issue but just want to address a potential misconception. Oxygen is replenished and transferred to blood cells in the lungs, then blood cells travel to the rest of the body and release the oxygen for other cells to use. HOWEVER, the blood cells normally don't actually release 100% oxygen before they make it back to the lung. Here's a illustration showing roughly that while it varies, even under intense exercise the blood cells still hold on to 35% of the oxygen. That means under typical situations you only have access to 65% of max oxygen pool in your blood. Now that is extremely simplified to the point where I should add caveats but you should get the general idea that that 7% difference is much closer to 11%, and any further drop in O2 is actually a larger impact than the flat % would suggest.",

            " There are a lot of misconceptions every time this subject is brought up.   EMI, Electromagnetic Interference, is a serious consideration in aircraft design and operation, and has been for decades.  I highly recommend this NASA report from 1995, PDF here, which details several incidents, aviation and otherwise. Probably one of the most famous is the series of five UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters that crashed between 1981 to 1987. The accidents were a mystery for some time, but it was later confirmed that they were caused by signals from radio tower which caused the stabilator to go to a full down position, which put the helicopter in a dive. These accidents earned the UH-60 the nickname \"lawn dart\" at the time.   IIRC in the 1990s it was quite common for the crew to instruct passengers to turn off all electronic devices for take off and landing. This is because it was not uncommon for devices to cause things like radio static or in severe cases minor interference with navigation.  To be clear, I'm not sure that consumer grade electronics ever posed a deadly threat to commercial aircraft. However, EMI shielding and testing was not nearly as thorough back then as it is now. Part of the reason for that is small electronic devices were not ubiquitous back then. Asking people to simply turn off an electronic device during take off and landing (critical phases of flight for navigation and radio communication) was not a big deal to people back then. It was easier for the FAA to just require that they be turned off, than to require extensive (and expensive) testing.   Additionally, I'm not aware of any credible sources which say that the reasoning was that passengers would pay more attention in the event of an emergency. It was certainly my personal experience that back then passengers stuck their noses in magazines and books as much as they do their cell phones and laptops now. If that was ever an official reason it was almost certainly not very effective.  **The FAA's decision a few years ago to officially allow electronic devices at all phases of flight was, as far as I can tell, for two reasons: better understanding of the risks because of increased testing, and the fact that we all knew people were doing it anyway.**",

They tell people to turn off and put away electronics because that is a lot of stuff flying around and injuring people.

            " The TL;DR is that the FAA used to have rules forbidding non-approved devices. They loosened these because they realized it was dumb.   Interfering with the planes electronics? Sure, its possible. But RF interference isn't a thing due to FCC certification, and it would have to be an *extremely* noisy device to cause slight interference with gauges. My wife has made phone calls when we've been up flying general aviation, and have had no issues aside from the occasional \"GSM Buzz\" in the headset - same as you'd get with speakers and a GSM phone.  Shielding? Nope, not really. Most of the electronics nowadays are digital (which helps), and shielded wires... but no more shielded than the cable you use to charge your phone. And they're not \"hardened\" by any means (unless we're talking military, which is a separate point entirely). The GA stuff I fly personally? Lol... and zero issues with a 1975 airplane (and probably 1990s electronics...)  Network congestion on the ground? Likely not - you're more likely to just lose signal and get kicked by the cell system, and not the FAAs problem. Remember, the FAA makes rules for *airplanes* not *cell phones*.

If a crash were to happen, the entire cabin would rapidly shake and everything  would be flying around. They tell people to turn off and put away electronics because that is a lot of stuff flying around and injuring people. Contrary to popular belief, most plane crashes are not fatal, they are more like rough emergency landings. Everything needs to be secure so the cabin doesn't have 100 cell phones flying around hitting people in the face.",
            " If there was ever any real danger there's no way they'd even let you have them on the plane. Plane crash prevention based on the honor system?? I don't think so...",
            " When mobile devices started gaining prevalence, airline operators weren't certain the device signals wouldn't interfere with radio signals and other systems on the plane, which could interfere with the plane's operation.  Since then, planes have been built with better electromagnetic shielding on their electronics, so those fears haven't really panned out. However, another concern might be that the attempt to connect to cell towers on the ground while traveling several hundred miles per hour - hopping between towers every few seconds - might cause some network congestion on the ground.  Regardless, since those regulations were put in place, device makers started introducing \"airplane mode\" features that shut off all device radios. That being prevalent today, airlines now tell passengers either to turn off devices *or* to put them in airplane mode."

        "sft_target": " There are a lot of misconceptions every time this subject is brought up.   EMI, Electromagnetic Interference, is a serious consideration in aircraft design and operation, and has been for decades.  I highly recommend this NASA report from 1995, PDF here, which details several incidents, aviation and otherwise. Probably one of the most famous is the series of five UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters that crashed between 1981 to 1987. The accidents were a mystery for some time, but it was later confirmed that they were caused by signals from radio tower which caused the stabilator to go to a full down position, which put the helicopter in a dive. These accidents earned the UH-60 the nickname \"lawn dart\" at the time.   IIRC in the 1990s it was quite common for the crew to instruct passengers to turn off all electronic devices for take off and landing. This is because it was not uncommon for devices to cause things like radio static or in severe cases minor interference with navigation.  To be clear, I'm not sure that consumer grade electronics ever posed a deadly threat to commercial aircraft. However, EMI shielding and testing was not nearly as thorough back then as it is now. Part of the reason for that is small electronic devices were not ubiquitous back then. Asking people to simply turn off an electronic device during take off and landing (critical phases of flight for navigation and radio communication) was not a big deal to people back then. It was easier for the FAA to just require that they be turned off, than to require extensive (and expensive) testing.   Additionally, I'm not aware of any credible sources which say that the reasoning was that passengers would pay more attention in the event of an emergency. It was certainly my personal experience that back then passengers stuck their noses in magazines and books as much as they do their cell phones and laptops now. If that was ever an official reason it was almost certainly not very effective.  **The FAA's decision a few years ago to officially allow electronic devices at all phases of flight was, as far as I can tell, for two reasons: better understanding of the risks because of increased testing, and the fact that we all knew people were doing it anyway.**",

    "\n\nHuman: Please help me, I'm a stay at home dad and my spouse is about to leave me. I don't even know what's going on.  I thought we had one of the most understanding marriages in the world. Fights, sure, but nothing serious and we always kiss and made up. Open account passwords and everything. Yesterday I could sense something was wrong and, to put a long story short, she not only stopped texting me, changed all her social media and email passwords, but suddenly didn't want to come home but take our young child. Wouldn't even talk to me unless I agreed to let the child go. More than that, she threatened to call the police to remove him against my wishes. None of this makes any sense, I don't know where any of this came from.  She agreed to let me keep him for the night and talk to me the next day but I'm so lost. I don't know what to do. I'm a stay at home dad with no income of my own, only like $400 on me, poor health, our lease is almost up, and am completely dependent upon my spouse's job to even have a roof over our head. We share one joint bank account.  I guess some specific questions I can think of are:  If she chooses to leave the place can I legally stop her from taking the kid? I don't even know where she is right now and she does have rich family out of state.  What recourse do I have when it comes to money and housing? I don't have friends to couch surf on, no family left to stay with. I'm all alone in this world except her and my kid. I don't even know if I could work my health is so bad; I've been too afraid of doctors to really see them much lately. I'm assuming if I can't work then I'm not a fit parent? I don't know how that works.  Arkansas is my location. There are no mens shelters, nothing. I'm so scared and confused. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:": {

Here's the thing though, 6 months ago, his company installed some kind of signal blocking device in the bathrooms because employees were going to the toilet and browsing the internet.   The doctors say that if he'd received medical attention within 20 minutes he might've made it but they didn't find him until almost 2 hours after he'd passed. Last month, there was a nasty car wreck just outside his office and apparently ambulances were on the scene within 10 minutes so I'm sure that if he'd been able to make the call, he might've lived.   I spoke to the company and they've told me to get lost, saying it's private property and they're well within their rights to use jammers how they please. Is that true? I'm struggling with the funeral costs as it is, I can't afford a lawyer, especially if it's going to go nowhere.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " 1. Sorry for your loss. 2. Did your dad have any life insurance in place?  3. Since your dad died at work, this could possibly be considered a Workers Compensation claim. Your odds are even better since the company installed a signal blocking device that could reasonably be linked to your dad's inability to get emergency assistance. Even if the device was legal, if it prohibited your dad from getting the help he needed then workplace conditions could be viewed as contributing to his death. That's workers' compensation.  4. As others before me have said, active cell jammers are illegal in the United States. If the company was using an active jammer you have a possible wrongful death lawsuit on your hands.   You should definitely seek out a lawyer who would handle this case on contingency.   &#x200B;",
            " The legality of blocking or jamming the signal is going to depend to some extent on how they did it.   Active electronic jamming is a violation of the law. That is where you basically transmit a signal designed to interfere with other signals.   Passive blocking on the other hand is generally fine. This is what hospitals use around MRIs and other sensitive machines. You basically construct the room in such a way as to block signals from entering or leaving. Sometimes this just happens because of the nature of the environment. Elevators for example are not designed to block cell signals, but they do anyways because of the amount and shape of the metal used to build them.   You can file a complaint with the FCC but I would speak with a lawyer first. Employment liability cases are tricky and you don't want to inadvertently harm your case.",

    "\n\nHuman: My wife and I bought our home a little over a year ago. Today a lawyer came to our door and told us that the previous owners were in a lawsuit with the construction company that built the home. They settled and would like to split the settlement with us 50/50. Does this sound legit? This is a surprise and my wife and I aren\u2019t sure how to approach this. We are upset that we weren\u2019t made aware of this when buying the house. The settlement money is for construction defects of the house and we feel that since we bought the house from the previous owner, we should receive more of the monetary amount to go towards repairs.  The lawyer indicated to us that if we wish to receive more than 50% of the settlement, he would reimburse us from his firm . This is a class action lawsuit that includes 40 some other homes. He needs everyone\u2019s signature to receive the settlement from the construction company.   My question is if this is legitimate?  Is there a breach of contract somewhere with the previous owners or the real estate company since we weren\u2019t made aware of a pending lawsuit that would make clear construction defects of the home?  Any advice would be appreciated.  Edit: We live in California.\n\nAssistant:": {

Call your real estate agent you used to buy the house and look back through your closing paperwork, if the previous owner knew about this stuff and didn't include it on the property disclosure form at the time of the sale, your lawyer will want to know that.

The branch manager simply said, we don't have to honor any cashier's check for a non-customer, and asked me if I needed anything else, and showed me the door.

    "\n\nHuman: My uncle died, leaving me \"in charge of\" my mentally disabled cousin in his informal will. I was just contacted by the facility he has been living in for the past 4 years to advise me that I was named as the family member to contact in case of my uncle's death. Where to go from here? in California My uncle died about 2 weeks ago. His son, my cousin, is 24 years old and is severally mentally disabled. He is completely non-verbal and has frequent violent outbursts. He has been living in a small facility for about 4 years now. My uncle has been paying the facility directly the entire time. They are in California, I am in WA state.   Last week my mom forwarded me an email from a lawyer claiming to represent my uncle. It includes an \"informal\" will. \"Informal\" because it is literally scrawled on the back of some random papers, and the exact phrase in it that pertains to me is \"*wut2do22* should be in charge of *cousin* if I die and she should have any of the money I have left over for taking care of him\".  I emailed the lawyer back, asked him exactly what this meant for me right now and he basically said that he was looking into clarifying a few things in the will and would get back to me shortly, and that if I wanted legal advice as far as conservatorship/etc goes I should seek my own lawyer. The second part of that makes sense, he doesn't work for free, but I do not understand what he meant by clarifying some things in the will. Is a will written by somebody without the involvement of an attorney/notary/typical will people still valid? Am I going to automatically become the guardian/conservator for my cousin?   I should add here, that although I love my cousin and am definitely going to be making the effort to be more involved in his life, none of this had been discussed with me at all. My uncle was having medical issues for a while now, and we are not very close. He and my mother don't get along very well, and for better or worse we have not been in each other's lives much. I do not know why he would have said that in his will, other than the fact that I don't know if he has anybody else he could name (ex wife, cousin's mother, died a while ago).   So, the facility my cousin lives at called me today and told me that I'm named as the family emergency contact. They were really nice, gave me a bunch of options as far payment extension and charity goes, and told me the due date for the next bill. This place is around $5500/month. I work PT while in school, my income (including my loan) is right around $1200/mo when you divide it up. Even if they halved the bill for this month, I couldn't come close to making it, and then there would be the month after that...  So what do I do? Is there some way to keep my cousin in the facility that he's been comfortably living in for 4 years? Am I automatically responsible for him, as a guardian? A conservator? Conservatorship seems like it has a lot to do with financial aspects, which aren't really relevant here as my cousin does not have any assets - and although I do not know what my uncle's financial situation was when he died, he had declared bankruptcy a few years ago and had gotten himself into more debt fairly recently.   I'm at such a loss of what to do here. My mom is willing to pitch in some money for a lawyer, but our combined amount we can spend is around $500 right now. And that could just be going to try to pay the bill at the facility, so at this point I'm going to try to look into a law office at the school in a nearby city to see if they could offer free advice. In the meantime, if anybody could shed some light on the situation, that would be much appreciated.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " IamaL, but not in CA or WA. In addition,my father's only sibling was born severely disabled and we as a family dealt with issues similar to this until Uncle B died at age 72.  As a severely disabled adult, your cousin will qualify for SSI (income) and Medicaid.   Medicaid , as opposed to Medicare, pays for nursing home and residential care.  Some facilities will take Medicaid patients, others do not. They are not required to do so.  If a paying patient stops paying, there are strong procedures in place to safeguard the patient as a transfer is made to a Medicaid facility. As a cousin, you would not have  any responsibility to support your cousin financially.  The facility knows the ins and outs of this in great detail.   From the information you have provided, it sounds like your uncle wanted whatever money he had to be used to benefit his son. He might have screwed up. Without a valid will, all his property goes to his next of kin which is presumably only his son, your cousin. Your cousin may not be competent to handle his funds and may need a guardian of his estate to do that. That is a different role than guardian of his person which is what it sounds like the facility contacted you about.  Medicaid is a means tested benefit. If you have assets you have to spend them to pay for care before Medicaid pays. Absent a valid will, your cousin now has assets.  (This by the way is a  large part of elder law and estate planning for disabled relatives).  However, all this is about money, not your cousin's person.  What the facility has told you is that you are expected to make decisions about his person, probably mostly his medical care, but also, if he goes on Medcaid, which facility he will live at. It is better to be formally appointed his guardian if you want that responsibility. There is not much expense  and it avoids  situations like finding out he is hospitalized 3 weeks after they did surgery or died, moved from Eureka to Bakersfield etc.  If you are not prepared for the formal responsibility, all US states /counties have Public Guardians whose job it is to step in and make decisions when a family member can't, won't or is just not  there.  Some states use different titles, but guardian and conservator pretty common.  As a kindness, if your uncle was buried or has his ashes  at a cemetery, use some of his money to pre-pay for a spot for your cousin near his dad.  You need an elder law lawyer. That is the legal specialty with the most relevant information for your situation. You need one in CA though because, although Medicaid is a Federally funded benefit, each state is allowed to set its own rules on how it is paid out. To find one, I would send you to www.Martindale.com which is the website for an old old lawyer rating service. Filter for a city in California which is near your cousin and for Elder law as a specialty.  Good luck"

        "sft_target": " 1. You have 0 obligation to your cousin.   2. You are not your cousin's guardian and you dont even have power of attorney to legally make decisions for your cousin.  Your cousin is literally an independent adult right now who is not capable of making decisions.     3. You have 0 legal obligation to pay your cousin's bills and if the facility misled you to make you think that the bills are now yours then that facility is ran by assholes scammers.  Again, you have 0 legal liability for any of your cousin's bills.        4. You dont need to get a lawyer at all UNLESS....you want to get power of attorney for your cousin or to become your cousin's legal guardian.  If you dont want to do these things then dont waste  a dime on a lawyer.   5. Your cousin is literally on their own and has Social Security Disability payments.  Your options are:   A. find a place that will take care of your cousin in exchange for his SSD payments. You can try to find the best place.   B. Let your cousin live with you and you try to care for him using his SSD income payments.    Get a lawyer to get guardianship or POA.   C.  Do nothing and let the current facility either decide to let him live there for SSD payments or for them to find a place to ship him to.      I suggest option A first and then option C as a last resort.    I would not even consider option B.   My aunt had downs syndrome and was never capable of any kind of language, basically a 6 month year old for 50 years until she passed away last July.  My grandma was a stay at home mom and took care of her 24/7.    I can tell you right now, if my grandma passed first. I would find the best home for her to live (with SSD payments) and would not even consider trying to take care of my aunt or paying for her.  No way would I sign up to care for someone 24/7.   All I can say is good luck and start googling for a care facility that will take your cousin for SSD payments.     Do not even attempt to pay this facility $5,500 a month (66,000 a year).  That is insane and not your legal obligation in any way.",
        "rejected_target": " my uncle was severely disabled and was abused at various care facilities in CA. my dad was his guardian but lived in OR. having a care manager who was in town was a life-saver. she would check in with my uncle and the facility to make sure the terrible, abusive situations that had happened previously weren't happening and would be an \"on the ground\" contact person for doctors, social workers, etc. this was especially important as he got older.   you should also check what the state of CA has in terms of disability, medi-Cal, etc. i believe we were able to supplement some of what we got from the feds for my uncle. does your uncle have a pension or life insurance?"

    "\n\nHuman: My former employer tried to pin a crime on me months ago, a detective just called me and asked me to speak with him at the police station, do I go? Throwaway and I am trying to keep this vague as to not give away any personal information.  Back around September my boss attempted to pin an embezzlement charge on me. I did not do it, and left my place of employment.  I got a lawyer and a case wasnt opened for a couple of months and he just told me not to worry about it, and it would just go away.  I got a call about 20 min ago from a local detective saying he needed to speak with me. I let him know that I was working until late in the evening and work all day tomorrow, and he suggested Monday. I said I could tentatively plan on that, and see what my schedule is.  He set a tentative time, and then dropped the bomb that he wants to speak with me at the police station.  Do I go? Do I have my attorney present? I'm shaking in my boots a little.   TLDR: A detective asked to meet with me at the police station, do I go?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Been chronically ill for 9 months, doctors at a loss had deemed in a medical mystery. Discovered mold all throughout our walls and HVAC after a water leak and the apartment complex has proceeded to threaten us, lie to us, gaslight us and try to force us into signing a NDA and a release. Texas We have been living in our apartment complex for just over a year. About 9 months ago I began to feel sick everyday. Constant nausea, headaches, lethargy, diarrhea, trouble breathing and random fever spikes. I have in the last few months had 5 covid-19 tests. I have seen multiple specialists that have thought it could be anything from Crohn's disease, MS, or even leukemia. All tests have came back negative and all I have ended up with instead of answers is medical debt. On top of that I have two cats who would get sick on and off throwing up, diarrhea, weezing and lethargy but it didn't even occur to me that it could be related at the time.  Fast forward to about a week and a half ago we wake up in the middle of the night to a foul smelling water leak coming out of our wall. We call the complex manager and they send a maintenance crew in the next day to open the wall and address the leak. None of these individuals were wearing masks. When they opened up the wall we discovered it was caked with mold with 5' standing sludge water at the base. It appears it has been a gray water leak that has gone on for months. Immediately once we realize the mold was so bad we told them that once they stopped the leak they needed to stop cutting into the wall immediately until we could have a mold specialist address the potential dangers. They ignored us and proceeded to blow an industrial grade fan into the wall in an attempt to dry the water. The whole time we're saying this is dangerous and should not be done this way. We call a mold specialist and he's appalled how they had went about it from a procedural standpoint and said it was reckless and dangerous to all parties involved. The apartment complex then says that we should just continue to stay there for the night or go stay with a friend. I am asthmatic and have it compromised immune system and I can't believe they just told us to go stay with a friend in the middle of a pandemic. They refused to offer to put us in a hotel. My boyfriend who I share the apartment with went to the office to show the complex manager the photos he had taken of the men working and to express his concern and she proceeded to tell him that it was illegal filming them and to delete the photos immediately. We looked it up and because we live in Texas which is a one-party consent state to record so that was just a blatant lie on her part. She later asked that we shared the photos with her. After numerous phone call exchanges where management continued to contradict themselves we have requested from now on that we only communicate via email. We requested that they hire a mold specialist to analyze the potential toxicity of the mold and they refused. So we paid out of our own pocket to have a specialist come in there and he said it was some of the worst he had ever seen. Lo and behold we get the results back and the amount of mold is off the charts. The particular strain that they found can cause edema, bronchial spasms , pulmonary emphysema as well as nausea and diarrhea. It was only after we told the complex that they said that they were having their own mold specialist going later that day. They have refused to let us see their results. At this point we strongly urge that they do not allow any cosmetic repairs to undergo in the apartment until proper mold remediation can happen. They don't respond to that email for 3 days and then on the third day send us an email saying that they are within their rights to terminate our lease since we are blocking them from doing necessary maintenance, and that if we don't come to a decision to either move into another apartment or terminate our lease contingent on us signing an NDA and a full release that they would be terminating our lease by 2:00 p.m. the next day. Effectively giving us less than 24 hours notice. I also want to mention that in Texas the governor has ruled evictions illegal until September 30th. We immediately reply and say we are not hindering them from doing repairs that we were only concerned for the safety of their crew and ourselves. They never responded to that. And every email where they bring up our options they present it as option A or option b and it's always contingent on the NDA and the full release. At this point we get the city code inspection involved and when we go to the apartment to meet the inspector we find a biohazard truck parked in front of our apartment and when my boyfriend goes in there to see what's going on he finds individuals in hazmat suits vacuuming all of our personal belongings. In one email she said the due to their inspection that they saw no reason why the apartment wouldn't be inhabitable, and a phone call shortly after she says due to the water damage the floor is not structurally sound and it's not safe for us to be in there.  My next email with her I ask if the apartment structurally sound for us to go in there to grab some personal belongings and she's in lies yet again and says that it was never an issue with its structural integrity even though that's precisely what she had said to a phone call that both my boyfriend and myself were on. She says that we cannot go into the apartment because they've had a cleaning crew in there that have used chemicals that would be unsafe for us to enter until Wednesday which she told us that on the previous Friday. If I had not emailed her we wouldn't have gotten any notification at all that this was happening and could have easily gone into that apartment unaware of the chemicals present. We have many emails of her consistently contradicting herself, and gaslighting us. The lack of professionalism and empathy they have treated us is shocking. We've tried reaching out to the tenant rights councils multiple times but due to covid-19 it's been incredibly difficult to get a hold of anyone. At this point we're ready to hire a lawyer. it's been suggested we find someone who specializes in personal injury as well as a familiarity with tenants rights and real estate. We have already spoken to a few that have said it's a clear-cut case of negligence and they wouldn't be surprised if our story ended up on the local news. It's been difficult for us since we both work full-time 9:00 to 5:00 jobs to get anything done and I'm so close to quitting my job so I can just focus on this.  I have already gone to see my doctor and explain the situation to him and when he listened to my lungs he was concerned and immediately sent me in to get an x-ray. He believes this is why I have been ill.  Any advice and recommendations on how to move forward would be greatly appreciated and if you have read your way through this post I am so very grateful  Sincerely, weezy mold grrl\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Got reported as being a suspicious individual after moving into a new area which led to an investigation after an officer claimed that my documentation is fake. Harassment has ensued - what do I do? I\u2019ll try to be as brief as possible and stick to the facts.  I moved into a new area at the end of last month. Specifically, I moved from Chicago to a small town outside of Charlotte, NC. This had been in the pipeline for several months as I was moving closer to be near family. Though I have made this move to be with family, I am living on my own.  I moved into a quiet, residential area. It\u2019s very suburbian, and there are not many solo residents in my age range (24 -39) living here. As a note, I am not African-American or of any other minority - I am a mid 20s white female.  Almost immediately, I met one of my neighbors, who began interrogating me on who I was, why I was there, where I had come from and what I was doing etc. This wasn\u2019t just a polite conversation, they were very clear in the fact that they did not believe that I belonged in the area. They asked me how I intended to pay my rent or mortgage since it did not appear like I had the means to based on the contents of my boxes, and very clearly pronounced that as a part of the local neighborhood watch, if anything were to happen in the near future then I would be their prime suspect. I brushed this all off as madness with a dash of being a jobsworth, and hoped to never hear from this person again.  About a week after I moved in, I received a visit from a local police officer. He said that he had been called because I had supposedly been acting suspiciously around the neighborhood, such as peering into front windows and loitering outside people\u2019s houses. The only time I had spent an extended period of time outside of my house was when I was tending to my front garden. I don\u2019t want to automatically declare that it was the neighbor I\u2019d originally met who had put the call in, but it highly likely that it was them. I invited the officer in to basically say that it was all lies because someone didn\u2019t like the cut of my jib.  An important point to make is that I am originally a British citizen. I came to America 7 years ago initially on a study visa, however quickly decided that I wanted to remain in America permanently. Through sponsorship from my first employer after graduating, I was able to gain my green card 3 years ago. In short, I am allowed to reside in the United States legally. Unsurprisingly, as soon as I started speaking, I was asked to prove my citizenship. I produced all of the relevant documentation, however almost immediately the officer said that he believed it was a forgery. He wouldn\u2019t go into detail about why he believed this, but I was told that what had initially been a cautionary visit to dissuade me from \u2018my actions\u2019 had become an investigation into me possessing forged documents. I compiled, mainly more out of shock than anything else, and went with the officer to the local station.  It became apparent very quickly that the officer had no leg to stand on. The first person I spoke to said that everything seemed legitimate, and joked that the officer who had brought me in was somewhat of an ICE-idoliser and was annoyed that the only crimes to happen in the area were petty thefts and the occasional incident of animal rustling. After another interview I was released with all of my documentation, and without any charge.  That happened about two weeks ago. My situation now is that it has become apparent that the police officer who I initially met actually lives in my neighborhood. I first realised this when I was outside the front of my house and he was driving up the road. He pulled over, and said that if he was on-duty he\u2019d arrest me for vandalising public property. I said that I was just in my garden, and he replied that I had no proof that I wasn\u2019t standing somewhere else in the neighborhood and being aggressive, and that he could produce witnesses faster than I could even imagine. 4 - 5 more instances like this have occurred if I have been visible to him in the past two weeks. I know that this must be some kind of police harassment, but currently he has not approached me at all while he has been on duty. Am I still able to somehow report this?\n\nAssistant:": {

She didn't write any of the book at work because you can't have your phone or tablet or anything else with you when you are at the register.

    "\n\nHuman: (Utah) Found out yesterday my sister has endured domestic violence for years; need help knowing how to dispose properly of a gun in the house My sister told me yesterday that she called the cops on her husband who was in a violent rage. He did not hurt her or her two kids (ages 5 and 2.5) but physically destroyed several things around the house before she called the police. He was arrested and charged with domestic battery and destruction of property. There is currently a restraining order on him to stay away from her & the kids until his court hearing Monday.   I had no idea the extent of it because she kept it all from me (I live several states away so it wasn\u2019t all that difficult), but apparently his anger issues and destructive tendencies have been a reoccurring problem for basically their entire relationship (about 4 years). So this has not been a one-time incident, but rather hallmark DV over the course of several years.   Her husband has a gun (my sister thinks it\u2019s a Ruger 9mm but I don\u2019t know for sure) that my dad sold him within the state of Utah a couple years ago. According to my dad, no paperwork/registration was needed for a gun sale of that nature in the state of Utah. During the course of the DV, he would often threaten to shoot himself or harm himself with said gun. My sister told me she would hide it in various places around the house to keep him from getting to it, and would keep the ammo in a completely separate location from the gun. (I know how incredibly dangerous that is with two young kids, even if gun/ammo are separated. If I would have known...) She is incredibly fortunate (if that\u2019s even the word to use in this kind of situation) that no one has been seriously injured or hurt because of the gun [yet].  I know she needs to get the gun out of her house ASAP, but I also know that she needs to make sure it is 100% above the table and also won\u2019t have any repercussions on any future custody/divorce proceedings that could somehow weaken her case or chances at getting full custody of her child.   A few questions:  1. What\u2019s the best way to get rid of this gun? 2. Would there be any potential repercussions in divorce/legal proceedings if she sold a gun that was his?  3. Can she even sell it? Not having paperwork for a gun sale or not having to register it at all just seems really weird to me, but I know nothing about gun laws.  4. In the meantime, if she isn\u2019t able to get rid of it altogether, can she give it to a trusted friend for safekeeping until she can speak with a lawyer and figure out how to proceed?  He is a legal US resident but does not have citizenship (I don\u2019t know whether this affects anything, gun-wise or otherwise).\n\nAssistant:": {

FWIW, it sounds like you have your neighbor by the balls if they are \"required\" to get you to sign this document for the sale to move forward, so you don't have to be shy about asking for fair compensation... or unfair compensation... as you see fit.   /u/jdc90403 suggested they need to buy 2.5' of your property and if you are willing to part with it, that's a pretty reasonable option. Instead of signing the document, sell them the land at a fair (or higher) price. Then the covenants will no longer be an issue moving forward. That would also be a benefit for both of you should either of you sell later on. I would definitely be wary of buying a house where the previous owner signed a variant like they are asking you to.",

I don't have any familiarity with Alabama law and how these covenants work, but this may give you the right to demand compensation from them in exchange for the variance.   In some states setback requirements can be strictly enforced, meaning they could be forced to move the house 2.5 feet away from you, an obviously extremely expensive endeavor. The compromise would be to get you to agree to waive the setback requirement, but your hesitance to just agree to a variance without any compensation is wise. If Alabama allows, you could potentially sue them to force them to move the house (or make it smaller). It seems like they don't want that.  I definitely agree with others that an Alabama real estate attorney would be wise. They can make sure the terms of the proposed variance don't overreach and may be able to get you reasonable compensation for the variance. Again, I don't know how strictly these covenants are enforced or how they are enforced, but an Alabama attorney would help inform you of your options."

All of my belongings were in there exactly like I left them, nothing appeared touched, there were no signs of a break in, and my car started up fine. It truly seemed like no one ever was inside of my car.   From the outside looking in it looked like I just left my car in that parking lot and forgot it was there.  The whole situation is extremely bizarre. The cops were confused as well. I really would like to determine exactly what happened and am unsure what my next steps are.

            " Not a lawyer but how close is the grocery store to your apartment. Is there a possibility you just forgot it there. I\u2019ve seen people make these sort of brain farts.   Also what make and year is the car.   A certain brand of car just kept reusing the locking mechanism on there cars. It was possible to use a key on someone else\u2019s car and drive away with it. Besides the obvious theft possibility of this scenario. There have been many reports of honest but distracted people driving away with the wrong car from a parking lot because they mistook it for there\u2019s. It\u2019s possible that someone with the same make did this in your parking lot and than drive to the store.",
            " So my questions for all of you are 1. Any idea what may have happened?   Did you forget it? Did any friends \u201cborrow your keys as a prank and freaked?\u201d Is it a newer car? Some older cars pre-chip could be stolen with generic keys. Maybe someone stole it and used it in a shooting    2. What are my next steps for getting security footage both from my apartment and the grocery store? You can call them but they probably won\u2019t bother unless the cops ask for it.    3. Any other things I should consider/be aware of?   If it is an older model, someone may have a similar key",

    "\n\nHuman: Minnesota: Landlord let people into my apartment and they robbed me. What now? For some background I am renting an apartment and my lease ends on September 30th. My landlord is an older guy who inherited this house; not a professional company or anything like that. I do have a lease that says I get 24 hours notice for entry except emergencies which I believe is the law itself, but in this case I did not get that notice.  Last week my landlord texted me shortly after 8AM saying someone is interested in buying the house from him (he has not previously brought up selling it so this was unexpected). He asked if I could let them in to see the place at 10, and then at 9:30 texted again saying he's guessing I'm at work so he's just going to let them pick up a key from them and lock up when they are done looking.  I did not see these messages until I took lunch at 12. I texted my landlord back saying I thought I am supposed to get notice for entry and I'm not comfortable with him letting people in unattended, he said sorry but they are going out of town and won't be back for two weeks so it was an emergency (though I'm sure that doesn't legally count).  Long story short they robbed me and I have it on security video but police weren't able to get much information from it because their vehicle is common and has no license plate, and they wore hoods and bandanas so you can't tell much about their faces. They took everything of value such as laptop and TV and even some stupid things like my lamps.  My renter's insurance originally was going to cover it but said they need a copy of the police report, and the police report explains the situation that my landlord gave them a key (as opposed to them breaking in). Now the renter's insurance says they cover breaking and entering resulting in loss but these circumstances makes it a civil issue instead of an insurance issue and I should seek to get reimbursed for my losses by my landlord instead.  Meanwhile my landlord is an idiot and did not even know these people. He met them at Dennys, only got their first names and gave them his phone number and told them his own address to pick the key up, but didn't get any of their information whatsoever like phone number or anything. I told him my renter's insurance won't cover this and because this was caused by him literally giving strangers a key to the place I would like him to reimburse me for my losses, he says he's sorry but at the end of the day it's these guys that owe me and not him and offered to talk to the police more to give them more description to find the guys but that's all he can do to help.  What now? Push my renter's insurance, sue the landlord, give up and cry? I would appreciate any advice anyone might have on what my best option is at this point.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " So what your landlord did is violation of the Landords and Tenants: Rights and Responsibilities for the State of MN.  First off your landlord is required by state law to notify you of this document which it doesn't sound like he did.  Secondly the document very clearly labels out what constitutes an emergency which allows the landlord to waive the written notice clause and this for sure doesn't fit any of the three criteria.  The three criteria are below.  &#x200B;  1. When immediate entry is necessary to prevent injury to persons or property because of conditions relating to maintenance, building security, or law enforcement.73 2. When immediate entry is necessary to determine a tenant\u2019s safety.74 3. When immediate entry is necessary to comply with state law or local ordinances.75  &#x200B;  If a landlord enters without proper notice and the tenant is not present, and none of the above three criteria are met he violated the law and is subject to fines per the violation.  You are also entitled to recover the fines collected by the court.  Sadly this only capped at $100.  Still worth a report though.  &#x200B;  Your landlord gave someone a key to rob you without doing his due diligence.  This isn't just incompetence what he did is negligence.  It also looks fairly clear it would fall under statute Chapter 604. Civil Liability. Time to lawyer up.  &#x200B;  It's also worth noting you should read Minnesota laws as it relates to your tenant rights (link below).  If you move for legal action he very well may try to evict you since he clearly doesn't understand state laws.  You should also plan on moving as soon as your lease is over.  https://www.ag.state.mn.us/brochures/pubLandlordTenants.pdf  Edit: I am not a lawyer.",

    "\n\nHuman: I'm 27, and I got a 17 year old pregnant....how screwed am I? 2 months ago I was in a bar, that had a bouncer, that checked IDs. I ended up meeting a woman at that bar, she was drinking, we started talking, we ended back at my place, we had sex. We did not use protection, which was dumb. Afterwards we texted a little bit, and then things went cold and that's cool whatever.  Well about 6 weeks later she calls me, tells me she's pregnant. She wants to keep it, I think well...ok lets start planning how we are going handle this because I don't see a relationship, then she hits me with the fact that she is 17.  I asked her how she got into the bar, she said she used a fake id. Also at no point in our conversations did I ask her age. She did mention she was in a college, which turns out that's a lie too. I knew she was young, I didn't think she was 17 I figured she was maybe 21, 22? This whole age revelation really derailed the conversation.  A week later I get a call from her dad, who was furious at me. I tried explaining that she used a fake ID to get into a bar that was checking IDs. I also tried talking to the dad how we need to start discussing child support, etc. He said he was to see me rot in prison for having sex with a 17 year old.  My friends have been suggesting I get a lawyer, and I plan on calling a few...but what kind of lawyer would I call for this? Also...do I have any legal protections considering I met her in an establishment where her ID was checked, and she used a fake ID to enter and had she not done that I'd have never met her.  We are in New Jersey.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " AS others have mentioned, this largely the pattern of a common scam, but that scam is more usually centered around an online relationship/sexting type arrangement where the 'father' demands for you to pay for \"counseling\".  Just be cognizant of that if they start asking for money for anything.  Providing alcohol to minors is illegal, but from my reading of the statute it appears that the prosecutor has to prove it was done \"purposefuly or knowingly\" (i.e. You KNEW she was underage)  https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2013/title-2c/section-2c-33-17/ and it sounds like that may be a stretch given the facts as described (in a bar where it is assumed everyone was carded)  Beware that if this IS a scam that demands for payment may be accompanied by faked 'documents'.    Paternity testing is usually done after the baby is born, although in-vitro testing is an option.  After ~8-9 weeks of pregnancy there are enough fetal cells present in the mother's blood for an NIPP (paternity test) to 99% accurate.  Just requires blood samples from you and the mother.  Can cost a couple of thousand bucks, but would be the fastest answer to whether you are the father.  Otherwise the risk is that you get repeated demands for money for \"maternity expenses\" for the next few months.  If you offer to pay for a NIPP test and they refuse to cooperate then you could reasonably approach this from the assumption of it being a scam.",

    "\n\nHuman: (MA) after giving me written permission to make a permanent decision, my ex changed her mind and has now decided to sue me for emotional damages. Advice needed--thinking of settling. I will probably consult with a lawyer in the near future. I understand that the title is vague but I was trying to keep triggering topics out of the title. I'm using mobile so there may be some formatting issues.   I have a daughter (13) with an ex who was not in her life. We were young, in our early 20s, when she was born. My ex wasn't ready to give up her life and be a mom yet so I assumed full custody. She had another child when our daughter was 9 and never spoke to our daughter again or really acknowledged her. I remarried as well and my wife has been an amazing stepmom to my daughter.   My daughter was diagnosed with cancer in 2016. I made sure to let my ex know of course and sent periodic updates. She didn't visit or call and basically things went on as normal.   In December 2019 it became apparent that her fight was drawing to a close and there was nothing anyone could do. I sent the following email (copy pasted text because I'm technologically illiterate, with private info removed):   \"Jess,  I want to let you know that we got the results of E's scan today. The cancer has spread significantly with several new growths and no change to the old sites.   At this time doctors are advising that treatment is unlikely to be successful and we would be better off providing her with comfort care instead. She will be a lot more comfortable and be allowed to go home which she really wants.   L, the doctors, and I have all talked to her as well as child life. She has agreed that it's time to come home. She is being discharged tomorrow to hospice at home.   As always, she would love to see/hear from you.\"   she replied to that email a short time later with \"thank you for the update\". She didn't call or reach out to our daughter at all.   After coming home from the hospital, my daughter asked me to mail a letter and to send an email she'd written to her mother. I don't know what the letter or email said but I know that neither one was replied to.   In January, our daughter passed away. I sent the following emails:  \"Jess,  I wish I didn't have to write this email. Our sweet E passed away in her sleep. It was very peaceful. I will send another email with funeral details.   Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.\"   and then the one about the funeral. I had to redact most of that one because it was full of personal information but this is the important part:  \"Jess,  In addition, we have decided on cremation. Please let me know if you would like any of her ashes. I can even get them made into jewelry or put in an urn for you and have it shipped if that's easier for you.\"  She replied to that one thanking me and telling me she would rather not have the ashes and that I could do what I liked with them.   We did. We gave some to my mother, had some turned into jewelry for my wife and three younger girls, I kept some and we buried some in a few of her favorite places. At this point the only ashes that physically exist are mine, my mother's, and my wife/daughters'.   Fast forward to the end of February and I get an email from her stating that she'd had a change of heart and asking if she could have some of our daughter's ashes.   I told her that unfortunately we didn't have any \"left\", but that my wife offered to send her the necklace she had made. She declined and did seem a little offended that we'd offered but it was all we had to give.   A few days ago I received notice that she was suing me for emotional damages for \"failing to offer her our shared child's cremains\" and \"offering a used necklace\" and some other nonsense.   I'm going to be honest: I feel like the only person who is being emotionally damaged here is me. I'm dealing with a huge devastating loss of my first child, my best buddy, my constant companion while also dealing with the stress of the pandemic/lockdown, two young kids who don't understand, AND a brand new baby (born end of March). I feel like I've been nothing but nice and communicative to her and this is what I get for it?   I'm angry, I'm tired, and I'm frustrated. Realistically, I don't even have the emotional energy to fight it and I'm seriously considering throwing some money at it and hoping it goes away. Is that the best solution?\n\nAssistant:": {

They don't typically handle family law, but they might have some perspective for you, and this action may come within the scope of your policy.  The letter was notarized, which means it was signed in the presence of a notary. There are several types of notarial acts, this most likely is the witness of a signature. What your ex has done is to swear, under pain of perjury, that the document is truthful. You have evidence that she was offered, and declined, some of the cremains, and that she was kept apprised of her daughter's condition at every step. Effectively, your ex has made a false statement before a notary, which is perjury. If you provide all of this information to an attorney, s/he may well be able to send a sufficiently stern \"cease and desist\" letter that sends your ex scurrying back under her rock.  Keep all of the e-mails and any correspondence. It is important to keep the e-mails in digital format, as a forensic analyst can review the metadata to verify the actual dates correspondence was sent, should your ex be foolish enough to pursue this ludicrous action.",

    "\n\nHuman: Landlady threatening to call police if I have an overnight guest. This happened today in the morning. I woke up to a message from her saying that I don\u2019t have her permission to have my boyfriend over once a week. And that if that happened she would call the police.  Nobody was over last night or even visiting.  I am willing to get a background check if that puts her mind at ease but she is adamant on me not having overnight guests. I only have my boyfriend over, no one else ever comes to visit.  There is nothing in the lease that states anything about overnight guests. \u201c The landlord and the tenant agree that the premises may be occupied by the tenant and their children, unless the landlord consents in writing to the occupation of the premises by some other or an additional person.\u201d This is verbatim from my lease. I googled the definition of occupant in regards to this issue and I am the sole occupant. He is my guest who stays over one night a week.  I asked her to show me in the lease where it says that, she did not provide me anything and just went on to say that they are her rules and they will have to be followed(she doesn\u2019t live here, she lives in a different city). I asked my roommate if she had any issues with my boyfriend coming over and she said that she did not have any problems whatsoever.  She went on to say that this is a female only basement and that I can\u2019t have him stay the night. She said if he stays the night she will call the police. She has met my boyfriend several times over the last year and is always so nice to us so I don\u2019t know what happened.  I asked her to show me the written rules and again she said I either follow her rules or find another place.  She never gives a 24 hour notice before coming because she has a room in which she keeps some old stuff. She just calls and asks to me open the door. This one time I woke up to commotion and when I went out, she and 2 other people(who I don\u2019t know) were grabbing the sofa from the living room.(it is a furnished house and all the furniture in the house is hers). When I went out of the room to see what was happening, she said oh I thought you weren\u2019t home. Also another time one of her friends just opened the lock and came in and took some stuff. When I brought this up to her during the argument she said that she did not want to discuss this matter further.  I was extremely polite but firm in my responses, so that she couldn\u2019t twist my words into serving me a notice to eviction the grounds of harassment. But she just says that she wants to keep this rule strictly enforced or I can find another place. I don\u2019t know what is going to happen . My boyfriend is going to get a background check first thing on Monday. I only have 7 more months of my lease left and then I\u2019ll leave. I told her that this is causing me distress and she is harassing me for no reason. I have not broken the law or any terms in the lease. I am currently not responding to her messages but she is texting me that she will call the police and evict me.  I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. I just need some advice.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: My underage daughter's boss asked her out. We are in Florida.  My daughter is a minor and works at a golf and country club.  Her direct supervisor is in his 40's.  He had been sending her non-work related texts for months.  She eventually became uncomfortable and I told her to only communicate with him regarding work related issues.  In December, he asked her out via text.  Specifically, he asked her to go golfing and have lunch with him on a weekend.  She turned him down and told my husband and I about it right away.  I told her that she should bring this to the next level of management and to request that her position be changed so that she is no longer working under him.  My daughter did this and the manager escalated the issue to HR, as I would expect.  HR immediately put my daughter on paid leave for two weeks so that they could investigate and make a decision.  My daughter supplied them with all of the text conversations.  After about 3 or 4 weeks, they had her come in and talk to HR and upper level management.  The upper level manager told her \"you don't understand the world of golf. It is not unusual for an older man to golf with a younger girl\".  He essentially made her feel like she took everything out of context and what happened was like a coach working with a student athlete.  My daughter is not a student athlete, she has never golfed, and this man is not her coach.  I have always told her to trust her gut in situations like this and I firmly believe this was more than just a man wanting to teach a young girl to play golf.  It is absurd that the manager even suggested this.  My daughter is not an idiot.  Her supervisor is the man who makes her schedule, sets her hours, sets her rate of pay, and has the power to fire her.  He should have NEVER put her in the position where she felt uncomfortable saying no to a request for something that is not work related.  Not an underage girl.  Thankfully, for their sake, she had the good sense to say no!  It has been several weeks since she first reported him.  They have told her they have not made a decision yet and that she is welcome to come back to work while they work on making their decision, but they will hold her position if she doesn't feel comfortable.  She is no longer getting paid.  Is there anything we can do or is it just time to move on?  She is saving for college in the fall, so she needs to work.  My instinct tells me it's time to move on. She will never feel comfortable there now that management has made her feel the way she does, but it kills me that she is the one who will suffer when she did nothing wrong.  Any advice is appreciated.  Edit: I should note the non-work related texts had gone on for months before he asked her out.  He also asked her to send him photos of herself so that he could add them to his contacts on his phone.  Just inappropriate messages from the start.\n\nAssistant:": {

A receipt only shows you wrote the check and they received the check; if the check bounces (since you mention elsewhere that you\u2019re \u201cliving on the margins\u201d and that could potentially happen), you still need to make the rent payment. Showing that the check was deposited shows that."
