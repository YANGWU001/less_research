I admit that my first reaction to the thought of teaching high school is a big stomach-clench. It sounds like a huge step down from where I am now (postdoc) and it also sounds like a difficult, miserable, and underpaid job (which also sounds a lot like a postdoc).  I was listening to the Freakonomics podcast this morning (haven't finished the episode yet) and it's mainly about teachers. They have a few statistics that really sell me on the importance of high-quality high school teachers. Also, I hate to admit this but a big thing that changed my mind was the salary. I had always assumed that teachers made about $30k or so, but according to the podcast, the *median* income is in the $50ks. I would imagine with a PhD I could position myself nearer the top of the income bracket -- google says:  >The BLS reports the median annual salary for high school teachers was $55,050 in 2012. The best-paid 10 percent in the field made approximately $85,690, while the bottom 10 percent made $36,930. Compensation is typically based on years of experience and educational level.  The advantages I see are:  * Better pay than a postdoc, adjunct, and possibly even associate or assistant professor  * Job security  * Summers off (? not sure if this is a real thing)  * Able to pick up my kids from school (I think?)  * Can make a career change without going back to school for an additional degree  * Based on Freakonomics podcast, potential to significantly improve many kids' educations and subsequent lives  * Can pick a job where I want to live, rather than the other way around  Disadvantages:  * Research career is over forever (but so is grant writing career!)  * Is probably a very hard job (but so is being a postdoc/professor)  * Probably everyone who contributed to my education up until this point will see me as a failure  * Everyone else who is impressed with me for having a PhD will not be that impressed any more  Am I on track with these lists? Am I missing anything? Do any of you have personal experience as a teacher?\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " I taught high school math.  I'll dispute/confirm some of your pros/cons and then share my experience.    What you've got wrong:  Pay is pretty much set in stone depending on your district.  Where I live, Phd's don't get an appreciably higher salary.  Everything is determined by how many years you've been teaching.  Where I live, a teacher with 40 years of experience makes $72k/year, and a first year teacher makes $50k.  Having a PhD increases your salary by $3k compared to someone with the same years of experience with a bachelor's degree.    You will likely need to go back to school for something additional to get your certification.  Most states have programs for this that make it doable, and many will allow you to do the coursework you need while you're actively teaching.  It will be all non-math stuff, things like classroom management, curriculum models, etc.    Plenty of people will still be impressed by your PhD.  Parents at your school will think you're awesome.  Other teachers will probably at least admire your knowledge, since most of them won't even have a BS in math.  (Most high school math teachers where I live have a BA in Education and took just enough math to qualify to teach math.  When I taught I had a bachelors degree and I was the ONLY person at my school with a degree in actual Math.  Out of 20+ math teachers.)     What you've got right:  You really will get summers off, unless you feel the personal need to use those for planning (I never did).  You should be able to pick your kids up from school, or have them in an after school program for a very short period of time if your school hours are different than theirs.    You will ABSOLUTELY be able to significantly improve many kids' educations.  No doubt.  Because you understand mathematics to a degree that 98% of teachers do not.  You will be able to better explain things, you will be able to see more clearly where the pitfalls are, etc.  You have the potential to do a lot of good.    You will be in high demand and will pretty much be able to pick where you want to live.    It is a hard job.  The hours can be long, and it can be heart-wrenching.  Be prepared to not only teach math, but to watch your favorite students go through some really tough stuff.  Your favorite student might end up pregnant, a kid in your homeroom might get arrested for dealing drugs in the hall, you may witness a knife fight in the cafeteria, etc.  (All things that happened to me.)  You will be invested in these kids in a kind of parental way, and it will affect you. Good and bad.     So, as far as my experience goes... I enjoyed it and I didn't.  I LOVED my kids and I loved getting to spend my days doing math.  (I happen to love Algebra 2, which is what I taught.)  I'm not teaching anymore, and I miss the interaction with the whole pre-adult teen crowd.  They're super fun people.    I didn't like the fact that I had to do everything according to a schedule dictated by my school district, and that standardized testing was so highly emphasized.  There was enormous pressure to get my kids to pass the test, even if it meant that they didn't actually learn the math - as long as they could figure out how to answer the questions correctly, we were good.  I didn't like that the majority of my students had sub-par math skills coming into my class and I had to try to figure out how to fix that while also teaching the stuff that I needed to do.    I quit when my oldest son was born, and I'm not planning to go back to being a high school teacher again.  If I had to work right now (I am a SAHM and don't plan to work again, but you never know), I would either go to elementary school teaching (where I feel like I could make a bigger impact in the eventual outcomes of my students math skills) or teach at a private school that doesn't use any standardized testing.  Those jobs are not as in-demand though, so it would take some real effort to find those positions.    Hope that helps!"

In addition, in roles where you will be working with experts a PhD can help smooth the path - it helps that you understand academic culture, that you're able to assess evidence, reassures the experts you're working with that what they say won't get lost in translation and so on.   For companies outside tech and pharma a PhD can be more of an issue - people aren't familiar with them, they think you're over qualified, they're often mystified as to why you're applying for the job, they think you're going to leave etc. So if you want to work outside the field of your PhD, and by outside I mean completely unrelated, not something like Sci Comm or scientific editor, a PhD can be an issue.   I won't say what job I do, but suffice to say I have counterparts in across the public, charitable and academic sector and probably 2/3rds of us have PhDs. It definitely hasn't been a hindrance."

In my undergrad, I majored in psychology with a good amount of math, computer science, and humanities courses. After a few years traveling and doing non-academic things, I'm now getting my Masters in religious studies, with a focus in East Asian religions, while working in a computational neuroscience lab on the side.  I've loved each of these stages of my life, and think I'm happiest when I have a healthy amount of variety what I get to think about. But I feel like this breadth doesn't lend itself to a career path. On a gut level, academia as a whole still feels like thing that fits my personality and interests the best, but I don't know if my interests are too stubbornly diverse to go into a PhD and potentially academia.  In the course of trying these various disciplines out, I have realized a few things:  * I seem to get tired of one topic or one discipline very easily and really crave novelty / variety. Even though I'm in a religion studies masters, I can only really tolerate taking two religion courses or else I starting getting a little miserable. But a mix of religion, philosophy, psych, and something math-y has been keeping me pretty content. (In the past when I was a math major and then a psych major, I also was pretty unhappy when I was taking only courses in those departments.) * I do have some underlying driving questions. In particular,  my ultimate goal is approximately understanding how humans behave and think and how people's lives can be improved on a psychological level. That's essentially the only reason why I'm doing religious studies right now, in service of that goal. But if I pursued a PhD, it'd almost certainly be something in psychology, probably clinical psychology. I want to be able to think about this question in a rigorous way that it seems like only academics have the freedom to, which makes academia seem like the route I lean toward most. I just wonder if, given my track record of constantly switching from subject to subject, I am a prime candidate to find a PhD project interesting for a year or two and then get really sick of the narrowness and demotivated. I know that this happens to a certain extent to everyone, but it seems like some people are better at pushing through it? And I don't know if I've had that fortitude in the past.  I know it's impossible to tell how any individual will find doing a PhD. I guess I would just like some advice if there are signals that I might be more or less likely than average to make it through a PhD. Are there people in academia who successfully are able to be generalists and draw from many different disciplines and to be thinking in a variety of different ways? Or if you really want to succeed in academia, do you really just have to specialize and only very marginally draw inspiration from side reading (which is not necessarily bad either! Just hard to tell what that will feel like in the concrete).  Anyway, if anyone has any insights, that'd be greatly appreciated! Thanks for reading :)\n\nAssistant:"

You might have a few related projects but you can't realistically hope around like that. Your best bet is probably keeping one as a hobby -- I did this with my college minor.   If it's type of work (writing, reading dense documents, coding, math, teaching), academia might actually be a good fit because you do have to switch between a lot of types of work. I always had really diverse interests and part of what I really like about academia is that you often are involved in every piece of a project and doing lots of things, so when I'm fed up with my code, there's probably a paper I should be working on instead and vice versa."

I ended up in another good department, with very nice people. I have a super supportive advisor, I cannot complain about the work environment at all.   Yet I am crying every single morning.   Work-wise, I have a few research projects going on, not all of them very promising and therefore hard to push for good publication. I also need to find a new job market paper (understand a new thesis project) for next year if I want to stay in academia. This makes me feel completely drowned in a fuzzy and disorganized never ending and panic inducing to-do list.  Personally-wise, the pandemic was associated for me with a lot of traumatic moves cross continents and 8 months without a real home, so the idea of having to move to a new place at the end of my postdoc and then eventually at the end of my tenure track possibly is making the future terribly stressful in my eyes.   None of this comes from my work environment, and more from my feeling that academia is a constant (very competitive) selection process. And I was fine with it until now, where I really feel like I\u2019m not good enough to go through it smoothly, and I\u2019m not sure anymore I can take the stress of it. Is this a common feeling?

While the culture of academia and its job market are daunting and near soul crushing, the compounding effects of experiencing it during a pandemic should not be taken lightly.  In 2020, I defended in a bedroom in my in-laws house, sitting on the carpet. I committed to a job a week before institutions started pulling their job listings, scared to email the search chair to see if my job would still exist in the fall. We moved across the US to a city my wife and son had never visited because COVID meant we couldn't just fly out to check it out. We didn't look for houses because of this, and because we waited for a few months, the housing market blew up. The list goes on, of muted successes, missed chances, or seeming failures, all because of COVID.  I thought I was somewhat alone in this, until I participated in a fellowship for early career faculty in my discipline this past summer. We were all 'successes', defending and landing TT positions in a pandemic. It was wild (and oddly comforting) seeing how many of us were struggling with mental health issues because of the isolation COVID has wrought.  I say all of this to preface two recommendations: (1) don't give up on your postdoc or any desire to stay in academia until you devote time to your feelings about work from COVID-induced trauma, and (2) as part of your program development during your postdoc, allocate hours, particularly during year 1, to your mental health recovery.  I do better if I treat my mental health as part of my research program, as another task I allocate time to. However you handle it, what are you doing for your mental health right now? What's your plan for it for the next year, and what's your long-range plan for it?"

It's a quickly-growing area of interest, and papers are regularly published about new ways to count/assess/quantify characteristics from images.  Obviously, these methods involve some sort of code - MATLAB, Python, etc. - but so few authors cite any sort of Github repo or any other method of sharing.  Frustratingly, none of the authors I've ever reached out to have responded to my requests for code.  This has happened a few times now, and more often than not I'm forced to re-write some program based on the sparse description in the paper (not a small feat for someone with a non-CS background).   It just seems counterintuitive to me that a 'new method' paper wouldn't actually share the new method.  Isn't that the point, accelerating the field of study and whatnot?  There's some new journals that are moving in the right direction - not allowing submissions without proof of data and code in a repository, for example - and those who are committed to open-source programs, which is great.

You'd think that gaining outside citations would be a plus but I figure that a lot of people would rather try to squeeze what they can themselves out of the method.  The analogy I can think of now in astronomy is the sharing of observational data. It's gotten a lot better now but people like to sit on their data and squeeze what they can out of it. Of course, if you share your data (perhaps after some proprietary period so you can get first crack out of your science), then you can gain citations and help the broader field. But that's not always been the case and there are still plenty of sub-fields where people feel it's better to keep their own data, talk about the amazing stuff that one can do with them, and then just keep publishing results from them themselves."

As others have said, it sounds like she's already trying and asking her to \"pay attention\" will only accomplish making her feel bad about herself and to stop asking for clarification when she misses things.   Just as an anecdote: I went through undergrad with undiagnosed ADHD, and I would try my damndest to pay attention and take notes. Even so I would regularly miss things because my mind wanders no matter how hard I try. It only took one professor lecturing me that maybe I should try \"paying attention\" after I'd asked about something he'd already said for me to pretty much stop asking questions in class even when I was completely lost. Much to my detriment for the rest of my undergrad career.   If you want to help her, answer her questions and as others have said, maybe point her to some resources. If you're worried that she's wasting class time, defer her questions until after class or office hours. You say that it is on the student to keep up with these things, but it sounds like she is taking responsibility on herself to make sure she doesn't miss things -- that's why she's asking questions if she misses something."

I wrote a paper from an analysis of an epidemiological dataset during a summer research internship between junior and senior year of undergrad. I\u2019m not aware that anyone else in that summer program even wrote a paper, they were busy collecting data while I had been given one that was ready to go.  Anyway I managed to finish this paper within the two months we were there for the summer, and after I left the PI ended up working on it and submitting it to a journal maybe a month or two after. That journal took a few weeks and said no, so he sent it to another journal, and another journal after that. The paper finally got selected for publication about a year and a half after I had actually finished writing my final version of the draft.  My point being, publishing always takes longer than what you\u2019d expect. Even now, papers that do accept us for reviews/revisions usually take 6 months from submission to acceptance, especially when we have to do other experiments to address the comments from the reviewers."

My OCD is with perfectionism, where absolutely everything (seriously everything! ) has to be perfect otherwise it's worthless and I am a failure.

What I'm concerned about is that I think I won't be accepted to anywhere without some research background if I were to jump right into PhD. Some of you might ask why don't I just get some experience, but here in Korea professors rarely provide meaningful research opportunities to undergrad students as they somehow believe \"undergrads aren't just smart enough to do research\". My professors recommend me to finish up to masters here and then apply to PhD programs abroad so that I'll have some research experience from my masters. However, I think thats a complete waste of time, doing a masters and PhD separately when you can just go straight to PhD.   So what looks like the best option for me? Should I stay for couple more years and get the masters? Or should I jump right in without some meaningful research background? (I do have decent GPA, GRE, etc etc though)\n\nAssistant:"

That doesn't mean there are no downsides.  If you express strong religious adherence, especially to a sect that is known to judge or exclude populations that may include some of your students, even if you don't personally hold with those beliefs, students might see your objects and worry that you do.

If you are a graduate student with a very good chance of graduating, then I would keep smiling, say yes ma'am/sir, and do what you're told, but document EVERYTHING.

There are many factors I am trying to take into consideration, but these are the main ones:  * Loss of enthusiasm and passion in the field.      * I started out liking basically anything you could do with computational chemistry and biology and intended to get into computational drug design, but after my first potential advisor left the university I had to transfer departments and join a computational biology lab.      * I didn\u2019t like my initial project on \u201cprotein structure refinement\u201d. My advisor isn\u2019t super familiar with the topic and I was completely overwhelmed with the huge amount of messy data I was dealing with alone. I\u2019ve finally got a grasp on how to deal with the data, and am almost done writing the paper. However the experience really killed my interest in the field as a whole. Projects that I would have been excited to work on a year ago have absolutely no appeal to me anymore.  * I prefer a broadness in knowledge, not depth     * It\u2019s inherent to a PhD to know a great deal about an extremely narrow domain of science. However I prefer spreading my knowledge out across many domains.  * I\u2019m one of those \u201cI want to be called Dr.\u201d people     * I never considered the opportunity cost (especially being in my 20\u2019s) of a PhD when applying. I\u2019ll probably be here for a minimum of 4 more years, based on previous PhD students in this lab.     * As much as I want a doctoral degree, I don\u2019t have a practical use for one.  * I don\u2019t plan on continuing academia (or any research) after graduation.     * I really don\u2019t like most aspects of the academic environment (isolation in research, people who pride themselves on overworking,  etc).      * I would never take a postdoc position, and would be strictly looking in industry for a job. Even in industry I would be weary of any research positions.  * Jobs are mainly in academia, and there are easier paths to any industry job I would be interested in.      * I\u2019m pretty close with my family (in the upper midwest) and want to be geographically close to them (an hour or two drive at most) but PhD level jobs in computational biology are few and far between (mainly on the coasts), and would almost certainly need to move for that.      * The main field I could get into without moving across the country in industry would be data science, which is fairly  obtainable without a PhD. If I market a computational biology masters correct, I could probably a job with a masters alone.  * I have an opportunity for a job if I leave.     * I have a close friend from my chemical engineering undergraduate doing well at a wastewater systems engineering startup and has guaranteed me a job if I should want it.      * I somewhat regret leaving engineering, and could see myself working there.   My apologies for all the text. It\u2019s hard to think clearly about these things through all the sunk cost in the form of time, and  you can\u2019t exactly discuss these things openly with lab members without word spreading.

Not that it can't be a good choice to stop, but the more that choice is driven by a current relatively vague feeling, the more I'd wonder whether there might be something beyond that would be worth exploring.  I'd also quibble about \"depth\" versus \"breadth\" - this may be field-specific but there's definitely a risk of superficiality in my field if someone hasn't dug down on something - the depth also gives you a kind of generalizable insight you don't get without that focus. Once you've been down there, when you know what real, deep knowledge looks like, even if you subsequently branch out you'll bring that awareness/levelness/benchmark with you.

Maybe your two kids with Mary are vulnerable to the new plague, but your kid with Jane inherited resistance from her mother. Your genes live on because of that diversity.  There are very few negatives to having offspring by several different partners, and most of them are socially imposed and thus highly variable and likely inconsistent and thus weak in terms of selective pressure. Plus, while maternity is usually clear (cuz, yanno, half the village women help with the birth and see the baby emerge), paternity often isn\u2019t.

I'm much more comfortable with the linguistic side. The problem with trying to dive so far back into the linguistic history of humans begins with modern language. Every modern language is fitted into a language family based on its similarities to other languages, and those families are not always universally agreed upon.  For example the Japonic language family consists of the languages spoken in the Japanese archipelago but some linguists also categorize some languages spoken on the Korean Peninsula at various times as fitting into the Japonic family while others do not call those languages \"Peninsular Japonic\". Peninsular Japonic only went extinct in the first millennium C.E., so running into a roadblock in categorization in only the last thousand years or so makes classifying and dissecting older languages from that region all the more difficult. These problems occur all over the world once we go back from modern language families to their prototypical fore-bearers. Finding the relationship between Proto-Indo-European (P.I.E.) and Proto-Afro-Asiatic (P.A.A.) depends on knowing that we have a very reliable knowledge base for those Proto languages, but they're largely built on many many educated hypotheses and some level of conjecture. And the ancestor of those proto languages only split into P.I.E. and P.A.A.  around 16,000 B.C.E. at the earliest. We honestly have no strong evidence for how, where or when that split actually happened. We don't even know IF that split happened, if the two languages were ever actually related at all or if they developed from two or more unrelated ancestral languages. With Neanderthals dying out around 40,000 years ago and our linguistic history kind of dead ending (for the time being) around 20,000 years ago (or fewer) there's a huge gap between our understanding of language and our interactions with other Homo species. I hope that helps to explain why, even if we did exchange language with those other humans, we don't currently have any evidence of that."

Take Skateholm in Sweden, why would a buried dog need an antler hammer? Look at the Langdale greenstone axes, axes are functional or are they attractive, or is there some quality we don't understand that straddles both? We are missing the context in which material culture arises in almost all of prehistory, why would someone go to the trouble of carving out an ornate beetle from lignite and carry it around alongside an actual necklace trilobite fossil?

As this article will show, the spirits of Tandroy dead haunt this  locale  in  the  form  of  animated  and  troublesome  zombies  who threaten  to  undermine  the  economic  and  social  stability  of the  living corrupt the integrity of indigenous Sakalava identity.\"  Sharp has extensive interpretation and context for this story,  >\"Finally,  as  noted  earlier, Sakalava  informants  stress that  Antandroy typically  do  not  send  migrants'  bodies  home,  especially  if  they  die outside  Tandroy  territory.  This  is  verified  by  data  collected  by  other anthropologists working with Antandroy. As Fee's informants explain, it  is  indeed  prohibitively  expensive  to  transport  a  body  back  to  its southern ancestral land; some also state that this practice is taboo (T. faly).  Fee  reports  that  she  knows  of no  case  where  a  body  had  been shipped  home  from  more  than  50 km  away,  and  such  cases  involved those  who  had  occupied  transhumant  settlements  within  Tandroy territory.  As  is customary  in  many parts of Madagascar,  a  wooden or stone marker (T. aloalo or tsangam-bato) is placed at the edge of a village in memory of a migrant who died far from home (Benolo, 1992: 85). As Fee stresses, 'the \\[southern\\] landscape is sprinkled with these markers. Of the many migrant men \\[from the village where she works\\] who have died  up  north,  none  of the  bodies  were  returned'  (personal  communication,   31   January   1997).   And,   thus,   the   corpses   of   migrant Antandroy  essentially  remain  abandoned  in  the  alien  territory  of the Sambirano, where they are unwelcome, restless, and feared.\"  The entire article is worth reading the whole way through. Wonderful as folklore, and revealing for the political and cultural interpretation of where this story is coming from.  These kinds of stories, of wandering ghosts, appear in many other geographies, particularly in Asia-- often with a similar thread of workers who've died somewhere that they can't be peaceably buried; the migration and death abroad of rural workers is a story that shows up in a lot of places  Toulson, Ruth E. \"The anthropology of a necessary mistake: The unsettled dead and the imagined state in contemporary Singapore.\" Southeast Asian perspectives on power.

One culture might see reliable river transportation as a problem to be solved, and another may not.

Enthnogeography is technology. Social hierarchies built around trade and hunting are technology.   If we look at technology only as the stuff that created ocean sailing vessels or spaceships, then we're falling into the trap created by enlightenment and imperialist thinkers that were asking the question \"why did white people win history\" instead of \"how did cultures perceive their needs and solve their problems related to those needs.\""

In all likelihood, bottle gourds probably had many uses. Immature gourds are technically edible.  Additionally, dried gourds could be rattles used in entertainment and ritual purposes for example. In many parts of West Africa, the gourds were historically decorated and used in divination rituals or containers for ritual substances and its no stretch to suppose they had similar functions in other places and times. As you point out, more practical uses would be bottles for liquids (water, beer, milk, etc\u2026) or as containers and tools like bowls or ladles.  For early hunter gatherers though, the most vital and attractive feature probably was for storing water.  Consider how wide-spread and populous humanity became after the end of the Pleistocene coinciding with the hypothetical domestication of the bottle gourd.  That kind of distribution and adaptation could only have been possible in many parts of the world if humans had a way to store and transport potable water in areas where such water was scarce.

Now the question becomes at what point were people (or human ancestors as would be the case in the South African cave discovery above) combining things like seasonings & other foods? That is impossible to know because most food decomposes and we just simply don't have evidence for it. Trash piles, which are great sources for finding animal bones & shells, won't necessarily tell us this because we can't know if their combination happened prior to being thrown on the trash heap. Without writing or preserved food we have no way of knowing when it first happened.   However, we do have some interesting finds that hint at these issues. There is a 6,100 year old pot that had ground garlic mustard seeds in it suggesting the cook used them to season a dish. This is the first direct evidence that we have of using spices in cooking. It is highly unlikely that by pure chance the first instance of this was the one pot that was preserved so we do make an educated guess that there were older uses of spices in food preparation. We just don't have the hard archaeological evidence for it.   We also have evidence of pots that were used in fires from about 20,000 years ago in China.  We don't know what was in them but if people were using them to make stews, which makes sense given their shape, it is possible they were combining more than just one food type and water. Other scientists have recently published about food residue evidence from ancient pottery. They found that Japanese pottery from about 11,000-15,000 years ago probably contained seafood. But there isn't much more they can tell and since the pots were likely used again and again even if multiple foods were indicated we don't know if they were cooked together in one dish."

I forget if it\u2019s amniotic fluid or blood pumped by the heart or both, but that books whole theory of early baby care is about recreating the noises, movement, and snug environment of the womb for what the author calls the \u201cfourth trimester\u201d as the baby continues to develop and yet be pretty much helpless.   Notice that all of the sounds given here\u2014shhh, hsss, ciii\u2014are all sounds that count be given to water flowing.   Now, baby treatments don\u2019t necessarily lead to permanent social customs. For instance, while kissing babies seems near universal, the romantic kiss is definitely not universal. In fact, while in some places the romantic kiss is just seen as \u201cdirty\u201d, in others, such as among the Nuer, it is seen as specifically infantilizing.

There\u2019s a theory that the maternal kiss allows the mother to detect what germs her baby has and create breastmilk that has those antibodies in them.)  Similarly, I can imagine that\u2014if this is indeed a human universal practice for babies because of the babies pre-delivery uterine environment\u2014in places shushing is seen as huge infantilizing and only appropriate for children, never adults.

We are doing no such thing. We are saying that the kinds of environmental arguments Diamond uses are a problematic way of addressing racism.\" (bold and italics added for emphasis)  I'm a cultural anthropology PhD student, but I think Diamond is worth considering as the consequences of how we summarize and explain things to general audiences. It's been a long time since I've read Diamond years ago as an undergrad, but the jist that still sits with me is that *why yes, environments do affect the way people and societies in them develop.*   However, I think that it leaves a lot of agency (and culpability!) out of the hands of people themselves.   For instance, Diamond's coda on Japan argues that agriculture didn't \"appear\" until rice crops reached a critical mass of development where they were adapted to the colder, drier climate of the Korean peninsula. That made sense to me as an undergraduate and I even wrote a paper on it. But in my own seminar work as a PhD student, it became apparent that the answer is much more complex - and while environment is a factor, Diamond got some of the details backward and forgot to consider peoples' agency.  *(It wasn't the crops needing to be adapted, but rather local environmental fluctuations and political/civil unrest that was happening around the same time that encouraged people to move and find new places like the more hospital parts of south Japan right across the Tsushima Strait).*  And from a sort of broad, superficial appearance of things (breadth over depth) it makes generalizations that \"look okay.\" But the problem with that is we can't assume that general audiences carry the same big mental asterisk that comes with these generalized assumptions.  So my suggestion would be to approach any of these popular history/social science books the same way we might think about how a topic is taught in 3rd grade, 6th grade, and 12th grade, and college. Diamond's intent to broadly interweave a lot of information and cover a lot of ground is admirable, but the problem is that when you write to a popular audience you can't or forget to qualify your generalizations.   The problem with something like Diamond is that unlike Bill Nye or Mr. Wizard, Diamond isn't just simplifying scientific principles that sound like \"technobabble\" to people. He's minimizing complex socio-cultural actions and their consequences as circumstances of environmental causes. And that erases human agency, colonialism, imperialism, etc.   Don't rely on popular books to be authoritative. Use them as a starting point... Diamond doesn't have a long list of citations, but Wikipedia does. :)"

This is most evident in journals that publish articles from both fields, like the Annals of Tourism Research. An anthropologist's article might summarize months of living with a single community (small group) in which many mothers sell souvenirs on the streets of Cusco, Peru and discuss how they engage with concepts of class and race at home and at work (broad questions). A sociologist's article might discuss how souvenir vendors across the entire city (big group) price and market their goods to specifically target tourists and encourage them to make purchases (narrow question).  * Anthropology questions social categories and asks how they are constructed and performed; sociology begins with them as social facts then asks how people navigate a world within them. The anthropologist might ask \"These people identify as indigenous- what does that actually mean and how do they do it?\" The sociologist might ask \"Given that these people are recognized as indigenous, what does that mean for their lives and how do other people experience the same things?\"  * Anthropology studies culture: a collection of shared practices and beliefs. Often, it struggles with the issue of subjectivity: how do individuals relate to their culture? Sociology studies society: a collection of individual actors. Often, it struggles with collective action: how do groups behave as groups?  Again, as has been mentioned, the methods and subjects of both fields overlap significantly, and you're likely to find little difference after the research process has finished. There are so many anthropologists and sociologists doing ethnography (not to mention political scientists, etc.) that it's difficult to provide a general answer. You can undoubtedly find two anthropologists whose ethnographic methods are more different from each other than from sociology's."

So it's not as if people *had* to start thinking about this in order for it to happen. Efforts to explain reproduction would very much have been \"post hoc,\" whenever it is that people began to actively consider such things.  We don't know if our ancient ancestors began to put this together well before anatomically modern *Homo sapiens*. Maybe they did, maybe not. There's no archaeological evidence for this. The fact that we exist at all means that prior to the ability of our ancestors to explain reproduction, we were nevertheless engaging in it. As does every other species that reproduces via sexual intercourse / the recombination of genetic material from two or more parents.  But we really have no way to know when people started to try to explain how babby was formed. So we have to essentially guess. Certainly the realization of cause and effect far precedes the development of writing, although the specific mechanisms almost certainly did not (someone more familiar with recent history will have to fill in where and when people seem to have first begun to observe the in utero developmental process).  Like many things, though, it's important to remember that people in the past were still people, not idiots. They had culture, and many generations of traditional knowledge to draw upon.  They need not have understood *how* sexual reproduction works in order to recognize cause and effect, or to come up with explanations for how it happened.  Pair bonding and \"rights\" of exclusive sexual access among members of social groups are behaviors that can be observed among non-human primates. Once our ancestors developed the ability to reason, tying the cause-and-effect of sexual intercourse with reproduction would likely have been a matter of recognizing that those who did not engage in sexual intercourse did not produce offspring, while those females who *did* engage in sexual intercourse produced offspring.  Really, though, this is what's known as a \"just so\" story. We have no way of knowing when these kinds of realizations appeared, or how they developed."

There are a number of reasons that skin colour and altitude are correlated, but there are two mains ones. #1 Melanin protects the skin from heavy sun exposure and prevents the destruction of some vital light sensitive nutrients (e.g. Folate). #2 Melanin blocks sunlight which is necessary for vitamin D synthesis - in areas with low sunlight having darker skin increases the risk of vitamin D deficiency and rickets.  I can't comment on your the specific populations you used as examples. However, in general, skin colour does not exactly correlate to latitude for a number of reasons.  1) Similar latitudes do not necessarily have similar UV exposure. There might, for example, be differences in cloud cover. Or less protection from the ozone layer. I'm no expert on this, but UV lines are a little wobbly!  **2)** Population migration - quite simply, those populations who have migrated more recently are less likely to match up to the expected level of skin reflectance and skin colouration. After 10-20,000 people seem to conform to expected skin reflectivity values - but humans are a lot more antsy than that! Migration seems to account for most outliers.  3) Skin colour is plastic and changes with sun exposure - one population where most people have jobs indoors will likely have a lighter average skin colour than a similar population who often work outside... or take long holidays in the bahamas. Tanning!!  4) There is more to skin colour than just melenin. All sorts of things can affect skin colour - to pick just one example, the number of capillaries on the skins surface can have a marked effect. I know less about this, but two skins of somewhat different hues may have similar melenin levels and, thus, be equality efficient at protecting against UV.  For more on this #1 & 2 Jablonski's 2000 article \"The Evolution of Skin Colouration\" has you covered. Or is that \"coloration\"? Help me out here."

You can see broad examples of everyday egalitarianism even in hyper-modern communities by examining any social dynamics with no clear rulers or hierarchies and where those within such dynamics come to general consensus on decisions without dictation (many friend groups do this).  There is a catch in the semantics you use, as the very term \"formal civilization\" is/was defined by the very people (us) who both exist within and define \"civilization\" to begin with. Again, anthropologically speaking, we can examine multiple forms of human society and without coloring our language needlessly with terms like \"formal\" in regards to assigning values of success or legitimacy. That being said, egalitarian tribal/band societies have proven both successful and legitimate throughout the entirety of human history and into the present. There is something to be said about the rise of civilization being prompted by the advent of intensive agriculture (high-energy/low-nutrient monocrops) and carried on a wave of subsequent population growth (due to the nature and abundance of this food) that has, both intentionally and unintentionally, eclipsed other indigenous human societies and manifested hierarchies of competition and conquest (generally for resources, including power). In essence, \"civilized\" societies were more numerous, voracious, and ruthlessly competitive (as the nature of such society necessitates such expansion) and thus have annihilated or drowned-out other societies. These other societies, however, still exist and, more/less, quite successfully despite their struggles."

In other words, if there's a positive, there must be a negative as well, right?  Such reasoning, though, usually implies a misunderstanding of the role(s) of those norms within a society, and the way that a society works in the first place.  When we look at other social species-- not even just mammalian, but even insects-- what we see is that in *all* of these social species, various rules exist governing sex, sexual access, rights / permissions, etc. Sex is, after all, a fundamental part of biological existence. It's what allows species to propagate themselves. And in order for that propagation to result in viable offspring, the development of various behavioral rules was favored. Not every member of a society has or can have sexual access to every other *potential* mate. You simply can't allow that kind of free-for-all, because competition for mates-- and sexual selection-- are two major factors that contribute to adaptive change.  Behavioral norms regarding sex are part of what allow animal societies to continue to function. We can see this kind of behavior among all of our close animal kin (great apes and other primates, for example). We see it in bees. We see it in... as I said, practically every social animal species.  Humans are somewhat unusual among animals (but not unique) in that we can and do engage in sex for other reasons besides pure procreation. Pair bonding, recreation, etc. But in the end, we still are social animals, and a functional society requires certain norms of behavior-- guidelines, taboos, etc.-- governing what is, at its most basic, a fundamental biological process by which we propagate our species. For most of our existence, sex has had the likely potential outcome of offspring. And since producing viable and competitive offspring constitutes a significant survival advantage, various norms (biological and social) regarding mate selection, access, and restriction have been strongly selected.  Coming back to my opening sentences... the existence of a positive (rules governing sexual behavior) might seem to imply the potential for the existence of a negative (no such rules). But simply put, it's not possible to have a functional society under such circumstances.  **edit:** It's worth noting that attempts to establish so-called \"free sex\" societies have generally resulted in the fairly rapid establishment of rules governing who does and does not have access."

Here, by comparing population genetic results of humans and dogs from Siberia, Beringia, and North America, we show that there is a close correlation in the movement and divergences of their respective lineages. This evidence places constraints on when and where dog domestication took place. Most significantly, it suggests that dogs were domesticated in Siberia by \u223c23,000 y ago, possibly while both people and wolves were isolated during the harsh climate of the Last Glacial Maximum.

Not only is it much easier, but it also has not caused the same type of pain I feel in my knees/lower legs that other methods have caused. Remember this is the opinion of some one in the field, not a professional. If you have serious concerns about the medical implications about this practice, talk to your personal doctor; not a anthropologist. The difference between the way we carry things is likely cultural. For example most workers who come from a background in the food industry tell new workers to lift with their knees, not their back. As some one from many industries I find that most lifting methods damage your body at roughly equal speed, with the exception of balancing things on my head; which has not exasperated any apparent issues that I did not already have. Again if you have concerns or interest in following this line of thinking I recommend talking to a doctor, not a anthropologist.  PS: If your concerned about pain in your bones while aging I find the most important factor to be the ground your working on. After years of lifting with my knees at one location I felt minimal issues in my knees. One year in a tiled location has caused what seems like permanent damage, sensitivity to temperature and a much more genuine concern about my health then when I was younger. PPS: I am not a doctor, always talk to your doctor about personal problems, even if it's expensive. Unless your will to trade decades of pain for a at maximum a few hundred dollars."

Another factor that seems to play a huge part in making children behave is apparent in more than just the Lakota.  The use of a \"scary\" figure in Lakota culture it is the owl, the cici-man (basically the boogey man), and the wasicu (white man) were used to basically scare children into behaving. In the Pueblo culture, Kashare (sacred clowns) were also used to \"scare\" the children into behaving.  I'm sure there is a chance that the Inuit used some of these methods too, but I lack sources for it right now (I have a big binder full of source stuff but its packed away).  Sources at least for the Lakota bit, besides my own education:  *The Sioux, Royal B. Hassrick, 315-328.*   Edit:   Found a bit on Inuit family life/discipline. It states that young children were allowed to behave badly because they were so young but teaching was in the form of modeling correct adult behavior.  As in other cultures, taboos/gossip was another form of keeping people in line.  Children weren't usually denied their wishes, positive behavior was rewarded and negative behavior was indeed punished, such as withdrawing affection from the child.  *Never in Anger: Portrait of an Eskimo Family  By Jean L.

L\u00e9vi-Strauss was a introducer of structuralism in anthropology. He believed myths, fairy tales and legends are not so much about their actual explicit content but rather about unconscious structures of human mind hidden beneath. The structures in his view were constructed from systems of binary oppostitions (up-down, living-dead, old-young etc.).   In a nutshell, L\u00e9vi-Strauss thinks myths could act as a sort of simulation where you can let interact these oppositions and solve dilemmas and conflicts human mind comes into. A recurring motif in a lot of myths is a \"a mediator\" or \"a trickster\", something that defies the binary categories , something between that can bring the oppositions closer, such as fog (not a liquid nor gas, not transparent nor opaque) or scavengers (not herbivores nor predators) etc.  Sunshower also looks like such mediator because it's both rain and sunshine, it's cold from rain and it's warm from sun rays... This would connect it to the \"trickster animals\" menitoned in the wiki article.  I can recommend you read something about L\u00e9vi-Strauss' structuralism but I warn you it's a bit speculative approach in anthropology.

They explain that the Chetco peoples of Oregon have a story about a group of white people who showed up in the Pacific Northwest a long, long time ago, and were enslaved by the native peoples, then escaped to freedom and were never heard from again - until Europeans showed up, and the natives thought they were the Wogies coming back for vengeance.  In the footnotes to this passage (pg 557), the authors explain, \"this particular tale survived only because Chase believed the Wogies might have been shipwrecked Japanese!\"  I really wanted to read a lot more about this, but the authors don't really address the implications at all, they just move on.   I understand that indigenous oral storytelling can be incredibly accurate, even over thousands of years. So, I'm guessing it is likely that if some group of light-skinned people randomly showed up on the west coast hundreds of years (or longer?) before European colonizers, the Chetco people would be able to accurately remember it. It seems like there is an incredible event here, buried and nearly forgotten.  I guess my question is, what do you think of the possibility that light-skinned Asian seafarers shipwrecked on the west coast, or are there any other stories or evidence that might corroborate this theory? Did some other group of white people accidentally land on the west coast somehow, way before European settlers made it there overland?

(This applies to many plays and movies; *Game of Thrones* is a good example)   I accept that in simpler societies, moral philosophy was less thoroughly deconstructed and reconstructed than it is now, but that doesn't mean it was less fruitful for the average person.  There wasn't *complete* disregard for rights and life and limb in people's daily lives.  When a culture becomes like that, folk don't stick around. Not for hundreds of years.  They become refugees and move on.  Cruel people didn't have total free reign.

Your post brought this to mind.  I think the Hobbesian quip is ingrained in part because it makes good theatre.  It has been reinforced by a hundred filmmakers who use mud and misery\" as a shorthand for \"a long time ago on a continent far far away\" and who have a narrative need to heighten the desperation of their characters.  It makes a good narrative, in general, in our understanding of history as well; it's a flattering bias for us modern folk to imagine that philosophy and morality are on a simple timeline with the clumsy stuff at the distant end, and the refined stuff, the better people, available to us only here and now, like the best smartphones or whatever.  It's like the view that considers evolution as a directed process with modern homo sapiens as the *ultimate* result.

Anthropologists have stated that amok is caused by costum on Malay people to keep your rage instead of expressing it. People could be dangerous if they keep rage for too long, people who suffers amok will attack people and if they see any weapon, murder would instantly happen. That's where the word run amok came from.  Windigo is a common belief among American-Indian that during winter, there are people who get possesed by windigo and becomes murderous cannibal. This could be explained by winter depression which is existed among modern Western community too. The difference is, while you're depressed heat and food are available, for American-Indian, winter soemtimes forced them to stay inside their house. Hunger and cold might caused depression and halucination.  Most ghost related CBS are related to depression after death of beloved ones.

Which pattern predominates worldwide and historically?  Are there any patterns about which pattern comes to predominate?\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " English has been influenced by a number of other languages over time. Many common names today had Old English origins that would have made their meanings much clearer to their original speakers. One reason for this is that the names didn't change with the rest of the language: Stanley comes from Old English meaning Stone Meadow (or lea). The Old English word for stone was \"stan\", but when the language changed, the name stayed the same. We have names like Alfred which comes from Old English \u00c6lfr\u00e6d which in turn comes from \u00c6lf and r\u00e6d. The first is the Old English word for \"elf\" and the second is related to our modern word \"read\" as in \"to read a book\", but in this context means \"advice\" or \"council\" (probably indicating that people thought of reading as getting advice from a book). When names come from other languages, the origins or meanings of those names are even harder to understand. My name is \"Nicholas\", which I've learned is related to \"Nike\" meaning victory from probably Ancient Greek and \"Laos\" meaning people, so as a name, it means something like \"victory of the people\" (revolution? haha). Very common in western Europe was to take Biblical names though, so you have different forms of John across Europe (Jean, Johann, Ian, etc.) and because most English speakers don't have an understanding of Ancient Hebrew, the meanings of these names are lost to us."

This raises the idea that perhaps in a culture where shamans are expected to talk to spirits, or where everyone is expected to communicate with God or with ancestors, people with schizophrenia could \"blend in\" and not be seen as disabled - or would perhaps even be seen as gifted with an important skill or talent.  On a related note, Western cultures continue to have an interesting relationship with LGBT people, until recently viewing gay people as disordered, and still viewing trans people as disordered, whereas many cultures have accepted trans and queer people as a \"third gender\" and some have even ascribed shamanic powers to trans people, who can negotiate between the masculine and feminine.  I don't mean to equate being LGBT with being mentally ill (I myself am trans and have also experienced depression and anxiety, and don't view my own gender identity as disordered, while my depression and anxiety were much more clearly an \"illness\"), but to point out that definitions of what is \"normal\" vs. \"disordered\" vary from culture to culture, and are handled differently as a result."

There is also a fair amount of moralising/handwringing papers about, such as: \"Social bonds and Internet pornographic exposure among adolescents\" (Mesch 2009)  This is a topic that I think most contemporary textbooks/readers on gender and sexuality will cover indirectly, and feminist journals would be a good place to look for more material.  Sexuality and private sexual behaviour generally are always tricky subjects to research accurately, as people simply don't tell you the truth, and it is extremely difficult to elicit information about something that is socially frowned upon.  A general anthropological point to make is that the volume of mass communication in the latter 20th century and early 21st has had profound effects on social relations, but in many cases has not radically altered their content. From my own research background, for instance, the family and parental relations of Filipinos working overseas are not radically altered by distance and the mediation of their relations by the internet; rather the online/mediated relations tend to resemble those people make in real life (see Daniel Miller and Maria Madianou's book on this for more detail).  So I would imagine that, in general, porn usage and its outcomes will tend to *reflect* RL social orientations to gender and sexuality more than it will *affect* them.

The flour's just a part of the picture.   You might not be able to find the exact protein content, but the labels are indicative. For example, AP flour is between 9-12%. If you really wanna know, you can call the brand.  I've replaced part of the flour with bread and it creates a chewier texture, but also adds to the thickness which I'm not a fan of. I also wouldn't recommend overmixing -- it'll create tough cookies as opposed to chewy. Alton Brown's \"The Chewy\" uses bread flour if it sounds up your alley.  Always weigh your flour. The spoon and level method isn't foolproof. Excess flour that is near guaranteed when using cups will contribute to thicker, drier cookies that don't spread as well.  Baking at a lower temp for an equal or longer time is probably the easiest thing to alter the outcome ime. As for ingredients...  Egg yolks, being primarily fat, will affect texture. Removing the white lessens likelihood of cakeyness. Extra egg yolks can make for a more substantial cookie, but also chewier.   Melted butter can't trap air like solid, but creamed butter can lead to a taller, cakey cookie as opposed to plain chewy. Do not overcream. Cookies with major spread have a lot of fat so additional melted butter is also favourable as opposed to solid butter.   You might also try using pudding mix in your cookies.  Through all my cookie fails, I've found the biggest thing is unfortunately sugar. If you cut it, even a couple tablespoons, it greatly affects spread and texture. White contributes to crispiness and spread. Instead of all white, using part brown sugar can make a huge difference. Molasses content means moisture on top of bendiness. Coconut sugar and turbinado are used as subs but are drier and do not perform the same in cookies. Weigh or pack your brown sugar as it's fluffier than white.  A great trick worth trying is replacing some of your white sugar with a liquid sugar. 2-3TBSP max for an average recipe should do. Pure invert's ideal but white corn syrup, honey, or thick maple syrup can be used successfully.  Always use room temp ingredients. If the texture's right but they aren't thin enough, lightly press them down before baking and/or bang/drop the pan towards the end of baking.

I use a stand mixer and beat the room temp butter (real butter, 100% cow\u2019s milk butter, 85% fat) on high until it\u2019s fluffy and white, and smooth as silk. I stop every so often and use a spatula to scrape down the sides, bottom, and make sure it doesn\u2019t get stuck in the beater. I add in vanilla extract or other flavors here that are liquid. I usually beat it for about 10 min to get it to the desired fluffiness. I then add in my powdered sugar, sifting directly into the bowl, and beat slowly until fully mixed. I then beat on high, scraping the bowl every so often, until smooth. I then add in any milk/cream to thin the incredibly thick buttercream and add food coloring that I need to here.   The key to the super smooth American buttercream is: proper powdered sugar, not a finely ground baker\u2019s sugar, real butter (room temp) beaten on high until white and fluffy, and sifting the sugar and continuing to beat until smooth.   Proper powdered sugar never leaves grains behind because there aren\u2019t grains to begin with. The worst is if you don\u2019t sift it or beat it enough and there are pockets of powdered sugar. It fully integrates and is incredibly stiff. If you add liquid and it gets too runny to use, just add more powdered sugar, beating it in, until it\u2019s stiff enough."

I was attempting to make an Irish Apple Cake this morning (still in the process) and the first step is to make the custard sauce that is supposed to go on top of the cake when you serve it.  I've never made a custard sauce before -- this was my first attempt.  Well, I screwed it up.  I overcooked it and now the custard has a weird, loose, scrambled egg-ish type of texture.  I don't think there's any way to salvage it, but is there any way that I can salvage the overcooked mixture to use in a different way -- in another recipe or something like that?  I hate to just throw it in the trash (I'm a very frugal person).  What's in it is 6 egg yolks, 1 1/2 cups of whole milk, and 6 tablespoons of white sugar (it called for 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla, but I never got to that point, so I didn't add that).  Any ideas?  Thanks in advance!     In case you're wondering how I screwed it up (and so maybe others of you who have never made a custard sauce before may learn from my mistake) -- the directions said:  \"Bring the milk to a simmer over medium heat.  Meanwhile whisk the yolks and sugar until well combined.  Drizzle a little of the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisking all the time.  Drizzle a little more, then transfer that back into the pan of hot milk and continue cooking stirring constantly, until the mixture coats the back of a spoon.  Do this slowly, over medium heat, and I like to use a silicone spatula or spatula to scrape the bottom and sides of the pan as it heats.  The mixture will become velvety and thickened, but it will not be as thick as pudding.  It will continue to thicken as it cools, so don't overcook or it can curdle.  Stir in the vanilla.\"  I got as far as tempering it and I dipped a spoon in there to see if it coated the back of it, but I wasn't sure what I was looking for at that point, so I thought that it wasn't at the point that it should be, so I kept cooking it, looking for it to become \"velvety\".  I should have stopped when I tried dipping the spoon in it the first time.  I think it was done then.  Anyway, that was my mistake.  Don't make the same mistake I did and overcook your custard sauce!  :)\n\nAssistant:"

We are a home based vendor so it has to be under certain food laws (basically not having to be refrigerated is the simplest understanding of it). Right now the idea is to make different pie crusts with the leftover cookies and butter. Then selling either the crusts or maybe some cookie/brownies baked on top. Any other ideas?  Thanks so much in advance for anyone who has made it this far. Sorry for the long post!\n\nAssistant:"

They are also very light for their size (only 55 grams for the one in the picture).

I've also tried ice in a hot pan to generate steam, this seemed to soften the crust.

You could put it back in the fridge for the gluten to relax, but it may still be hard to roll out (think croissants).

Next time you make the dough, try doing a salt rest. It will help with elasticity. So basically, mix your water (or whatever liquid) and flour only just until it comes together and there are no dry bits. Let sit for 30 mins covered in the bowl. Then, mix in your yeast on low for a few mins (2-3 mins) until incorporated. Sit, covered, again for 10-30mins. Then add in your salt and mix until incorporated like the yeast. Let it sit for 10-15 mins covered again. Then add in any eggs/vanilla, until it is incorporated. Then mix on medium until you form a gluten window. Then add in your small portion of butter just until incorporated.  This method allows the protein to break down and form stronger gluten strands\u2014 which has a softer, more elastic dough.

TL/DR: Pretty sure ATK's flour measurements are FUBAR  Hubs got the Complete ATK cookbook for Christmas and we've been exploring the recipes.  I've been on a baking kick lately and was looking forward to improving some skills using recipes in the book that I hadn't made before.   I've made bread successfully before. I enjoy baking, especially breads, but the two recipes I've tried out of this darn cookbook have spectacularly failed.   Today's failure was their Fluffy Dinner Rolls. The book said it was a tacky dough and not to dust the counter with flour, so I figured they had their amounts pretty spot on. It uses the tangzhong method and since I had not used it before, I figured the failure was mine and remade the dough when it was just unworkable after the first rise.  Threw out the first attempt, watched some YouTube videos so I could see what the dough should look like at the various stages and started again. I weighed my ingredients out and went to work. The dough never developed past \"soupy-gloopy\" stage, even after an hour of kneading (at probably a higher speed than the mixer would have liked).   At this point I looked at the recipe in the cookbook and compared some of the amounts to other similar ones online and noticed that the one in the cookbook was calling for too much liquid given the amount of flour and started adding more until the dough finally came together.   The fluffy rolls ended up being really good, but the continued failure while following the recipie down to the gram was really bothering me and I kept going over the steps in my head.  Step one: Convert volume measurements given to grams  Step two: Follow recipe as written  I went and got the cookbook to look at the volume measurements again as the first line of the introduction to the recipe is, \"We strongly recommend weighting the flour for the dough.\"  ATK's Fluffy Dinner Rolls calls for 2 cups of bread flour. King Arthur bread flour weighs 120g per cup. Gold Medal (the flour ATK says they use unless otherwise specified) weighs 120g per cup. While I was double checking KA's weight online, I noticed that they have the weight in ounces for a cup of their bread flour at 4.25oz.  ATK's recipe reads, \"2 cups (11 ounces) bread flour.\"  I FOUND THE (beginning of) THE PROBLEM.  2 cups of bread flour should weigh in at 8.5oz or 240g.  Went to ATK's Conversions section where they have flour weighing 5oz or 142g per cup.  Even using their own conversion table their given measurement is wrong.   This error is pretty consistent throughout the bread section. Any baker whose first step is to convert the volume measurements to grams using internationally recognized standards is set up for failure.   And  yet, in the back of my head I still think that maybe I'm the problem. After all, everything in this book was supposedly thoroughly tested. Has anyone else noticed this?\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " >And yet, in the back of my head I still think that maybe I'm the problem. After all, everything in this book was supposedly thoroughly tested. Has anyone else noticed this?  One of the things I've come to appreciate is that, while baking is technically about precision & you level-up your game by switching to things like moving a scale...it's really about precision for *you*.  Meaning we kind of have to develop our own personalized sub-version of the recipe that works...*for us*.  Like, I've done a TON of no-knead recipes over the years, and I always have to up the water massively, even when using a scale for the water & the bread.  I follow my own personalized, modified version, and get pretty great & consistent results every time!  The rules I've come up with over the years are:  1. Commit to making it at least 3 times.  First as-is, to see how it comes out with no changes.  Second to tweak & modify.  Third time to replicate the success (assuming your tweaks come out as desired).  It's so easy to quit & give up, but sometimes you just need to get it right & be exposed to a good-quality example to see what's good about the recipe, you know? 2. Once mastered, ask yourself if this recipe is good enough to go into your personal treasure chest of recipes, and perhaps even good enough to get onto your personal rotation of favorites. 3. A lot of baking is done by feel, which can be difficult when you're reading from a recipe book.  Food blogs with photos help, and Youtube videos help even more, but short of doing an in-person class with a knowledgeable instructor who can expertly guide you against their tribal-knowledge measuring stick, pretty much following the \"try it 3 times to master the recipe & techniques, & then make a judgement if you like it\" process is what's served me the best.  It's sort of doing something like making & maintaining a sourdough starter...you may fail thirty times, but once it clicks, it clicks, and  you *own* that knowledge!  I convert every single recipe to \"my\" recipe that works for me, in my kitchen, in the part of the world that I live in with the humidity level, sea level, and other factors that may or may not affect the results I get.  One of the things I constantly tell myself (and other people) is that failure is a **required stepping stone** on the path to success.  You're gonna have both minor & *major* disasters along the way.  Being able to acknowledge & then bypass the emotions of failure (i.e. wanting to quit, getting mad at the recipe, all the usual stuff our brain & our heart coughs up for us to experience lol) allows us to side-step quitting (which is the only path to *true* failure) & try the recipe again, maybe this time with more or less flour & more or less water, and keep iterating until success is achieved!  But yeah, I feel you.  I've tried stuff from time to time that was so far off it wasn't even funny lol.  Iterate & repeat until success is achieved is pretty much the best way I've found for really gaining mastery over certain techniques & specific recipes, as well as for building out my own little treasure chest of super-favorite foods!  Which is also one of the reasons I like the Serious Eats website so much, as they really put a lot of time & effort into figuring out their recipes.

I bought a baking pan at walmart yesterday for $9, it warped badly right away and jumped around in the oven at 350\u00b0, complete garbage \ud83d\ude2b - I mean my expectations were low, but I though it might last 6 months or something, it's wasn't even functional.

It takes around 2-3 hours at 20\u00b0C, if it's 2 kg mascarpone (you can beat it up with a spatula in a plastic container if you want it to be a bit easier to handle).   In any case you can beat it in the kitchenaid/robot machine, then you don't have to wait for it to warm up because it will do so a little bit by friction in the machine. Or you can use a blender with an attacched whip.   But most importantly, add it little by little to your egg yolks-sugar mix in the whisking machine, when you're sure that all the sugar crystals have melted. Give time to your cold mascarpone (use a normal size spoon, full) to be completely incorporated in the yolk+sugar mix before adding more in. Round 12 small yolks (or 8-9 XL) can take up to a bit more than 600-750 gr mascarpone in my experience. I don't recommend mixing all by hand because of the difficulty of getting a smooth cream with such a hard cream as mascarpone. But if you're very strong and willing to spend a couple of hours just beating it hard, then go on. \ud83d\ude01   I am a cook and my house mate is a baker. I did tiramis\u00f9 several times (he's from Treviso and he has the Veneto recipe, which claims to be the original and which I have learned from this guy). Made it for 10 as well as for 80 people.   And I don't use the whites anymore after trying his  recipe just with jolks. I always used the the mascarpone cold from the fridge (4\u00b0C, at much colder or almost frozen or not fresh laid your egg yolks might not work as well, don't use eggs that have been for longer than 2 weeks in your fridge if you want to make sure that your tiramis\u00f9 will look fine and be also safe to eat, unless you don't want to complicate things by pasteuring them yourself).   We had several discussions about havig or not having in the whites. I recommend his original version just with yolks as it tastes much better than my previous and it holds it's structure much better in the fridge, while the one with the egg whites might release some water on the bottom of your pan /container if you didn't eat it in the first 2 days, so it won't be nice to serve, as the whites won't be that fluffy anymore , especially if you used some kind of alkoholic liquor for the savoiardi, together with your coffe).    Hope this helps you to make an amazing tiramis\u00f9 , even if it's all not requested information. \ud83d\ude01  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiramisu"

Philadelphia is the most common brand of cream cheese where I live. The blocks have 7.4g protein and 34.1g fat per 100g. The tubs are only 5.7g protein and 25.7g fat per 100g, which is essentially 75% of the blocks. Most of that remaining 25% would be water content. If you can find a tub that's closer to the block % it would be a better option.  It's possible that you could use powdered milk to get the protein and fat content up to the right level, but it may result in a grainy texture or a different flavour.   My favourite baked cheesecake recipe is by comfortably domestic, if you're looking for one! Comes out perfect every time, not dry or cracked or curdled.  FYI block ingredients are:  *Milk, Cream (from Milk), Milk Solids, Salt, Vegetable Gum (410), Starter Culture. Contains Milk Solids 40%.* Tub ingredients are the same except an added preservative, but you can tell the % of milk must be higher."

It technically stretches about 30 miles from Detroit to Pontiac (all of Woodward Ave.) although the primary \"cruise\" areas are really from about 9 Mile Rd to Long Lake (18 Mile) and then once you get up in to Pontiac it gets very busy again.  The metro-Detroit area has a bit of everything, though, and for the most part nobody cares what it is.

Unlike the OP, we get a ton of muscle cars.  Mustang, Camaro, Charger/Challenger, etc.  Those are by far the most popular.  Corvettes are another very common car.  We also have our share of imports.  Honda's have somewhat fallen out of favor, but more because they don't really make anything performance oriented anymore.  We still get a lot of Subaru, BMW and VW.  We get more than a handful of Mercedes.  In my area, with as big as the automotive aftermarket is and with how many enthusiasts there are, we see some more of the unusual side of things, too.

My friend was making his 3 hour drive back home yesterday, having borrowed his family's 2008 Honda Pilot, doing about 90 down the highway when the car basically catastrophically fails, accelerator immediately stops functioning, all the warning lights come on, and he pulls over immediately. He gets it towed somewhere and the guy says the timing belt snapped. (Entirely owner error: it's his mom's car and she never got the belt replaced as per routine maintenance guidelines). Like I said, it's a 2008, and I think he said it was 114k miles.   From everything I've read, it sounds like it's almost certain the engine is shot (interference engine and all that). Currently the car is still at that shop. His family knows nothing about cars and is just trying to weigh their options right now.  From my understanding, they can either buy a replacement engine and pay to have it put in (from what I saw online, probably $2-4k for an engine, plus labor). Or they can just sell it. This is where I'm not really sure what the options are. Obviously it can't be sold as a drive-able car. What kind of value would it have as just parts? I can't imagine very much.   Any knowledge, information, advice, recommendations etc is appreciated. It seems like it's gonna be shitty no matter what - but hey, that's why you keep up with routine maintenance. If there's another option that I'm missing, please let me know. Otherwise, it's just a matter of weighing the pros and cons of the two available and deciding which to do.\n\nAssistant:"

From my research into the luxury sedan market I think I've narrowed down my options to the top three. I would just like to know from anyone who knows these cars which one would be the safest bet for long term reliability and comfort.  **2014-2016 Hyundai Genesis 3.8**  So I really love this car for its huge package of luxury features and hefty v6 engine with RWD. My grandparents own a 14 model which is not the same body style as the 15 but same engine and powertrain. They love theirs and have had no issues having owned it for several years. I wish I could just pick this car but I'm still worried about the GDI engines in them. My main concern is if the GDI engine will last me for a long time if I buy one of these used with between 70k-120k miles.  **2014 Hyundai Azera Limited**  This car is basically a decked out Sonata with essentially the same features as the Genesis. It is somewhat cheaper, has a smaller but seemingly more reliable transmission, and has slightly better mpg than the Genesis. My main concerns on this car are the pretty much the same as the Genesis with the GDI engine.  **2015-2016 Toyota Avalon**  This car I am really tempted to buy over the latter because of the brand more than anything else. Toyota has unparalleled reliability compared to pretty much any other brand. The car is nice for what it costs (its essentially a reskinned es350 with a better interior) but comparatively has no where near the same level of comfort and tech features as the Hyundai's do. The main benefits I can see are mostly the mpg since the v6 in that car is fwd and less horsepower.  Thats where I am as of right now. I still have yet to test drive these cars. If anyone has a better value suggestion for a luxury sedan let me know. Please someone tell me I'm over reacting about the reliability difference. I really would like to have confidence in buying one of these Genesis cars. Thanks everyone.\n\nAssistant:"

The point, I was eyeing the Ram 1500 and absolute majority of them in here (I am in EU so import only... and really limited choices in that matter) are with the 5.7l hemi.

Another possibility is F-150, which I do not like that much design wise and didnt exactly heard much praise about those either. Or what was suggested by my US friend, the Chevy Silverado. But those are even rarer than the Rams or F-150s. And local sources do not provide much help, because US trucks are not exactly the mainstay of our roads.

I took my 2022 Subaru BRZ to a well-reviewed family owned muffler shop 10 days ago and had them install an exhaust for me. Last Friday while washing my car I found this damage on my car, paint completely stripped off under my passenger door, and a lazy attempt to hide it. I keep my car in a secured garage and hadn\u2019t taken it to a different shop aside from them. My mechanic friends confirmed it and said the damage was right where an  arm from a 2-post lift would swing under if the tech was careless and didn\u2019t realize my car sits lower than your typical SUV, so he swung it under without checking and damaged it.  On Friday I called the muffler shop owner politely asking them if it was them, and he denied and said his tech didn\u2019t do it and that they were \u201cgood guys\u201d. I was furious because clearly they wouldn\u2019t admit if if they tried to cover it up with white tape. I then asked him for the security footage and he told me he\u2019d \u201cspeak with his superior\u201d and get back to me next week, and that he also believes nothing happened. This morning I called him again and he kept dodging me, saying he\u2019ll get back to me later and that his superior wasn\u2019t in yet (but reviews state that he himself is the owner) and he thinks that they didn\u2019t do it. He is refusing to show me the security footage, which I\u2019m unsure if there was any in the first place and I\u2019m losing my patience.

There's no sense in wasting a bunch more eggs, and it just makes your life more difficult.  I second the liquid egg thing, but get more than you think you need. Worst case scenario, you have breakfast for a few weeks instead of someone having to run to the store mid-shoot. Also have a spray bottle on hand to spritz the eggs if needed.   If I'm reading your post correctly, are you cooking the eggs tomorrow evening and hoping to bring them in the next day? If that's the case, they're going to lose a lot of volume and likely start to get darker around the edges, which is going to look real bad on camera.

If you\u2019re using cast iron pan bring it up to temp slowly to ensure it\u2019s properly heated through. Canola/ grape seed/ avocado/ rice bran oil all work great for this purpose. Typically for a steak or similar protein you want to see the oil just beginning to smoke before you add the meat. With that said, be sure not to burn the oil or you\u2019ll get a bad flavor.   - Make sure to avoid overcrowding your pan. Too many things crammed into a small pan will end up steaming rather than browning because the juices that are released during the cooking process don\u2019t get a chance to evaporate quick enough. Moisture in the pan = steam = grey meat.   - Avoid salting your protein too early before cooking. Salting meat and letting it sit for awhile will draw moisture to the surface. This is fine but make sure you\u2019re patting in down with a paper towel before you add it to the pan. Too much moisture on the surface will steam the meat rather than brown.   Hope this helps!"

However, oil is also flavourless (assuming a neutral oil of course), while butter has that rich flavour that is so important in cooking.  Vanilla cakes have a very subtle flavour, hence the flavour from butter is very important. On the other hand, chocolate overpowers the flavour of butter, so it's possible to substitute it out for oil for its moistness without noticing much loss of flavour.   Outside of just the ingredients themselves, there's also the mixing methods. A butter-based cake is usually mixed by the creaming method, where the butter and sugar(s) are creamed together. This isn't simply to just combine the two ingredients, but also to create small air cells within the butter that will allow for additional leavening during baking. This process is known as \"mechanical leavening\", since you're creating leavening from mechanical mixing. Here's an article from Stella Parks that goes further in-depth on how it works.   If oil is used instead of butter, then you won't get the leavening from the creaming process, so you end up with a denser product. This is probably why the oil-based batters you've had feel more like a muffin."

The taste was fine; well seasoned, added pepper, a little bit of brie, and some chives. But they were gluey pasty mess, barely edible. Here's what I did and where I think things went horribly wrong.  My plan was to try using baked potatoes for the mashed. But because of some holiday bazaar gift buying events, I needed to get the potatoes prepped ahead of time. So I baked the potatoes in the morning, let them cool and fridged 'em until later. Several hours later I tried peeling the (now) chilled baked potatoes by cutting in half and using a spoon to scoop out the cooked potato flesh. That ended up being a horror show and didn't work. Next I tried putting the baked potato chunks through my ricer and that didn't work either; potatoes were too hard to push through all them tiny holes.   At this point I'm slightly panicking because everything else is done and I just need some damn potatoes.   Next I put all the potatoes in a food processor and just chopped them up as much as I could, followed by trying to whip them up with an electric hand mixer and then transferred to a pot on the stove. Added melted butter and then warmed cream slowly and kept trying to whip, kept adding butter and milk hoping that it would cause the mash to loosen up. No luck, just gluey lump awfulness that tasted actually pretty all right, but worst texture ever, basically inedible.  I'm assuming that my biggest mistake was letting the baked potatoes cool before scooping the flesh, but was that really my mistake? And was there any point in this process that I could have done something differently and saved this whole mess?\n\nAssistant:"

Add an egg to the potatoes (fold it in, no more machine power for this.

Fry pans are the same as sauce pans, they have walls at 90 degrees and maximize the flat surface of the pan, giving you a large flat surface area for the same diameter pan as a saut\u00e9.   For the non professional they are interchangeable. For some professional kitchens they will further divide the classifications, large saut\u00e9 pans can be called batch pans and large fry pans are called rondos. But each kitchen and each geography will differ slightly in my 3 country and 15 years of work experience.   I know that many people are saying that the internet says otherwise. I completely accept that many people and pan companies describe them differently. But you try tossing something in a straight pan and jump fry (saute) and tell me it works better than a curved sided pot or a wok. I get that classic pans have traditional shapes/names and that can make it confusing. But if you are asked to saut\u00e9 something in a professional kitchen and you choose a small straight walled pan - you have made a mistake, a saut\u00e9 or rondo would be preferred. Sauces are typically reduced in 90 degree angled pans and pots. Another interesting divergence is the boucher knife vs the butcher knife.   In culinary school, and at one restaurant - reducing sauce in a curved wall pan would have the teacher/sous up in your business. A flat 12 inch pan has a larger capacity to transmit heat than a curved pan. It was viewed as a lack of understanding of the thermal capabilities of the different pans. Both were and are very anal places to learn and cook but both at the top of their game.  All this to say. Any pan can be over crowded and cause meat to steam. Nothing you want to brown should be on the sides of either a curved or straight walled pan. Steam is what prevents the browning (Maillard reaction at about 135c) as water limits the heat of the pan as the steam can\u2019t escape. Causing the meat to cook, or more accurately poach in its own juices. So spread the meat out and use a large burner to provide more even heat.   The thermal capacity of a flat 12 inch pan is greater than that of a 12 inch curved pan. As more of the flat surface is closer to the heat, this is especially true of hob, flat top and induction heating surfaces. Fire burners are a bit more complicated.   Further more, the material of the pan is often more important than the shape. I would rather sear in a curved wall cast iron or blue steel than a Teflon sauce pan. But that\u2019s a topic for another day.   Lots to learn and explore. Regardless of terminology - your focus on trying to learn what is going on in the pan is commendable. It really will lead to better understanding and better food.   The terminology difference comes down to a historical understanding of terminology vs a practical understanding of what the equipment does in the kitchen. Bottom line - there is a right tool for the job and a rose by any other name\u2026"

When staring with a wet ingredient like chicken, cheese or eggplant(after the salt has drawn the starch out) you have to start with flour.

Pound your chicken breast lightly and dredge it in AP flour, then dip it in an egg wash(4 eggs to 1 tbsp of milk), the dredge it in your panko bread crumbs(they give the best crunch) with some Italian seasoning and grated Parmesan cheese. You can use sauce from a jar, but you've put this much thought and effort into it so far, why cut corners now. You can find a great recipe for the tomato mother sauce online. It's a great starting point in building your own flavors after making it a few times according to the traditional recipe. You get your sauce on first since it needs to cook about an hour. After your sauce is on, get your chicken ready and spray a glass baking dish. I'd say 350F for around 20-25 minutes or until the inside is white but still juicy. Use a thermometer. It should be 165F in the center. When it has about 5 minutes left, ladle some sauce on top and finish with a slice of fresh mozzarella cheese. Put it.

I have trouble finding really good recipes when I want to go the extra mile, so I end up leaning too heavily on the few that I *do* have. I've been looking to branch out, and I find that many oft-recommended sites, while good, either lean too bland (The New York Times), are overly-simplified (almost every crowd-sourced site, as well as a lot of other common ones), or are hit-or-miss.  Here are some of my favorites, for reference:  * Esquire's Eat Like a Man series \\- surprisingly, this was great, although it's been discontinued for a few years. I think this was largely so good because the recipes were sourced from interviews with top chefs. The posole and jambalaya are still two of my all-time favorite recipes to make. * Amazing Ribs \\- kinda specialized, but good at what it is. I don't actually grill but I use this site as a good baseline to make any type of BBQ food in the oven/stovetop. * Rick Bayless / Diana Kennedy - Mexican is my favorite cuisine to cook. Many of these recipes are too hard to scale down or too difficult to source the ingredients, but the ones I can do, I've really enjoyed. * Serious Eats - I find that Serious Eats can actually be pretty hit or miss, with a lot of great recipes but also many that add complexity for no reason (I don't think the fish sauce and orange juice actually improves Kenji's chili recipes, for example). But it's often a great starting point.  Does anyone have recommendations? I'm open to cookbooks, too. I'd like to branch out from Mexican - I also really enjoy cooking North African, Southern American, and Italian cuisine.\n\nAssistant:"

Results Were Surprising    Age: 31  Sex: M  Height: 6'6\"  Weight: 250 Athletic  Race: White/Caucasian  Duration: 4 1/2 Months  Location: Lungs/Upper Respiratory, Upper G/I  Current Diagnosis: **Stage 4 Aggressive Gastro-Intestinal Cancer**  Current Meds: Pain Killers, Diuretics  As needed Meds: Lidocaine Patches, Anti-Nausea,  M**elatonin** sleep aid  Original:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/c2ls61/chronic\\_cough\\_and\\_now\\_coughing\\_up\\_blood\\_after/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&utm\\_source=share   So after spending some time at an Urgent Care, getting some scans lined up and trying to be patient, I woke up one morning to pain and compression over my chest. Urgent Care Docs had advised me that any escalation of symptoms should mean I go to the Emergency Room. Once there they almost immediately checked me into the ICU for observation and began running every test you could name. For the next 4/5 days I did just an unreal number of scans, 2 biopsies, and they drew enough blood to fill a small pool. Pain escalated daily while there so finding a solution was a running theme. So after a lot of trails here's what they found:  Current: Stage 4 Aggressive Metastatic Gastrointestinal Cancer ( Adenocarcinoma )  Previous: Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation   After doing a Lymph Node & Bone Marrow Biopsy they found my marrow filled to capacity with dead cancer cells. This pointed them in the right direction. My platelets were crashing daily (20,000 at admission) and I've got inflamed lymph nodes throughout my chest cavity which is one source of my (significant and at time escalating) pain. Its infiltrated my lungs and several vertebrae along my spine (causing vertebrae to show signs of Osteopenia) . Weirdly enough there's no noticeable tumor/mass/lump they can trace it back to. It's kind of just spread throughout (described as Adenocarcinoma) , though they were finally able to locate a small ulcer in my stomach that allowed them to finally be able to classify it. I've currently just completed my 3rd (now weekly) round of chemo (we started asap when other options such as clinical trials were deemed a non-option) and we've been able to stabilize a number of things (blood factors such as platelets, hemoglobin and the like) along the way. Many of my blood counts are still in the trash so clinical trails are not currently an option. In early stages of my 3 weeks hospital visit I was in a state called **DIC (**Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) which caused me to act like something akin to a blood squirt gun if i bled. Essentialy it screws with you clotting factors and any bleeding event is an issue. Any procedure became an issue and many my numbers were artifically raised in order to attempt anything that would cause me to bleed. Fortunately after a week of treatments and what felt like several wheel barrows of infusions we kicked my body out of D.I.C and am more or less clotting normally. Fun story: early one morning after the vampires took their daily does of my blood a CNA came in to do a routine vitals check. This particular morning they took 2 unique sets of blood samples plus a rather large sample for testing against infectious disease. This was also kind of at the height of my \"he's not clotting\" phase. During the blood pressure check it popped open all the fresh holes in my arm, causing them to bleed and freaked/surprised the CNA. Made me laugh. (end of story).  Immunotherapy is what my Oncologist are banking on right now so crossing my fingers. Chemo is causing reasonable progress (numbers are low but stable) so we're staying the course for now. My personal mid->long term goal is to find an alternative to opiates for pain management (who the hell knows why a person tolerates opiates for a buzz cause constipation sucks!!!) so looking at alternatives (THC pills potentially or preferably resolving the issue that's causing me pain)  I've been discharged from the hospital after 3 weeks so now I'm working to find a routine that works. Losing weight so a short term goal is stopping that (I'm rather tall and (was) muscular so my bodies nuking whatever calories I put in and I'm not putting in a lot due to general nausea, but smoothies have been my friend. Please let me know if you have any questions or advice.. I'll answer what I can and absorb what reasonable advice I read.\n\nAssistant:"

I am a very liberal dude who was born and raised outside of Boston. Its because I inherently fear being herded with very little information.

                "content": " mRNA technology is really interesting and a marvelous development in vaccinology.  Unlike vaccines we are used to, such as the annual flu shot, it does not contain any virus... No dead virus particles, no weakened or attenuated viral strains, and absolutely no risk of viral infection.  The mRNA vaccine, in short, gives your immune cells the information they need to recognize and attack the COVID-19 virus as soon as the body encounters it. It is a lesson that teaches your body to recognize a threat. Once the lesson is over the body breaks down the vaccine components naturally.  The great thing about this type of vaccine is that the delivery method remains the same but the type of virus (or even cancer cells) that the vaccine is for can change! Scientists just load a different lesson into the preparation and off we go! Development of new vaccines using this technology will continue to be safe and rapid.  Personally, and I guess clinically, my only concern with a lack of long-term data is how long the immune response remains effective. Pfizer is already on record saying that a 3rd \"booster\" may be necessary 3 months or so after the 2nd dose?  So far the worst outcome of any of the vaccines has been the odd blood clotting seen with the J&J single-dose. After 6 or 7 people out of 6-million suffered from this they halted administration to collect more data.  Literally 1 in a million and they paused for more information. THAT is how safe vaccine research is.  The AZ vaccine is also having recent and ongoing reports of abnormal blood clots as a reaction. Is it important to note that neither J&J nor AZ are mRNA vaccines.  TL;DR: I have concerns with such rapid development and deployment of a new vaccine, but that only relates to long-term data on ongoing effectiveness. Worst case scenario is another booster shot to remain immune. I have no history of allergic reactions to any vaccine and no reason not to get it. Protect your community and loved ones by protecting yourself.  EDIT: A word.  EDIT 2: Updated J&J phrasing.  EDIT 3: AZ vaccine information added."

Age 70, height 175 cm, weight 80 kg, male, white, non smoker, light drinker, no drugs, fit and active (walked 5+ miles a day, played aerobic sports his whole life and pushed himself hard), consistently healthy diet, family history of heart disease (father died at age 65 of heart attack, younger brother had bypass surgery in 50s), had bradycardia (~40 BPM for years), had bleeding in the brain three decades ago that luckily resolved itself, had heart arrhythmia detected by a doctor 5 years ago but he had stress testing done by a cardiologist and it was determined that he was fine. He also had heart imaging done at the same time and they determined he had a healthy looking and functioning heart.   He had a physical exam and blood/lipids test run ONE WEEK prior to his death and passed with flying colors, and his doctor of many years told him he could do whatever he wanted.   My dad (described above) suddenly and unexpectedly died a month ago, one week after his yearly physical. We did not do an autopsy so I have been riddled with doubt and guilt and confusion and shock. He was 70 and in extremely good health and fitness so this makes no sense at all, and it feels like he was robbed of his later years.   He was physically active until the hour he passed, and according to other family members who saw him, he was in good spirits/looked good/sounded good his whole last day. He was actively playing with/babysitting grandkids for most of it.   In the evening, he went to another room and seemed to just have sat down and died--It was 20 minutes from him leaving the room fine to being found sitting on the couch, unresponsive and passed. It did not appear he had struggled and it doesn't seem he called for help, he just looked like he was sitting down. Paramedics came but were not able to save him.   Obviously you guys cannot physically see my dad, and there was no autopsy (my family didn't want to get one in respect for the body), but based on the information here, what do you think could have happened to him? It doesn't make sense that he could pass his physical and go down a week later. Could he have had flu or cold or something with no symptoms triggering a heart attack or stroke? Or is it just sometimes just that seemingly random, where a 70 year old man could have a heart attack/stroke/aneurysm/arrest without warning, one week after testing well? I am looking for peace of mind on how something like this can happen out of no where when it makes zero sense. I feel so bad for him knowing he may have been alone and scared and unable to ask for help in his last moments. It also makes me angry that someone who took such interest and worked so hard at good health and fitness could go without getting a chance. On a future looking level, it scares me for my siblings and myself, as he did everything right and still lost his life suddenly. Please, any thoughts are appreciated, thank you.   Note: I posted a topic on this earlier on whether I may have given him covid and caused it, but I got the abbott covid antibody test and it came back negative so I didn't. I included more information here on what happened to get your thoughts on what happened. Thank you for your thoughts.\n\nAssistant:"

Statistically speaking, he most likely experienced a form of sudden cardiac death brought on by a massive heart attack leading to cardiac arrest. This definitely can happen without warning and a routine physical + labs wouldn't necessarily catch anything.   If you're curious to know, basically the artery has what's called a plaque, which is creating a little bit a narrowing but not enough that he would have experienced any symptoms even while exercising. The plaque can spontaneously break open and release its contents, which irritate the artery's inner walls and cause the body to form a massive blood clot there. This blocks of the supply of blood to the heart instantly and the person will have a cardiac arrest. If it makes you feel better, he likely passed out within moments of this happening and didn't suffer.  Of course, you'll never know for sure, but if you want a medical opinion to help explain what might plausibly have happened, that is one possibility. It's scary that things can come out of the blue like this but the truth is no matter how well you care for yourself and healthy of a person you are, things like this can and do happen not infrequently."

If you can see what is obstructing the airway, lay the person down, arms to the sides, and sweep it out with a finger. First response should be the Heimlich maneuver.   To do this place your hands around the person in a ball shape at the stomach. When you push into their stomach, be sure to move the direction of your fist in a curved upward motion. If the person is too large that you cannot reach around properly, do this same motion at the chest. The same should be done if the person is pregnant.   If they become unresponsive, unable to breathe or unable to breathe normally, perform CPR. Go to their side, check their pulse at the neck on your side, if no pulse is found within 10 seconds, begin CPR immediately.   To perform CPR correctly, place your hands, one on top of each other, on the breastbone. Square yourself over the body, use the heel of your hand to press down 2\u201d for any person over 8 years old. Try to keep the most even rhythms possible, repeating compressions at a pace of 100 to 120 per minute. Make sure the chest rises back up before pressing back down.   If the person is an infant, cradle them on your forearm facedown, use the hand to support the head and a leg hanging to each side of your forearm. Have the head slightly lower than the rest of the body. Deliver five back blows to the infant using the heel of your hand in the upper back area between the shoulder blades. If the infant doesn\u2019t spit out the obstruction, sandwich your other hand over the child and flip. Perform chest thrusts between the nipples with two fingers. Only go 1.5\u201d deep for an infant. Make sure the chest rises back up before pressing back down. Do five thrusts before flipping back over for back blows.   Obviously this is ideally performed by someone certified but if you cannot have official training, try to best familiarize yourself with these procedures.

I can taste it on my tongue and it is making my life miserable, I am very paranoid as well I am a 14 year old female. I am around 5'6 and weigh around 170 pounds (please do not judge too harshly, I have actually lost about 20 pounds recently and am getting better with this.)  I don't do any drugs, I take no medicine, besides sometimes Claritin I take for my allergies on and off. I'm mixed with my mom being white and my dad being Dominican. I live in the US      This started in September of 2020 and has continued to get worse with no signs of slowing down or stopping. There have been some occasions where I have gone an entire day without the smell, but I'm not lucky enough for it to continue and it's been prominent ever since. Please keep in mind.. I have barely left my home since the pandemic started. Since September to now, I have only left the house 4 times but I do spend a lot of time on the back porch. My mom does all the shopping and such so I don't have to go with her to do those things.    At first, the smell was very subtle, kind of like it was far away, and it smelled more like burnt rubber. I ignored it and figured maybe there was just something in the house causing the smell. I asked my mom, she said she didn't smell anything, asked her husband who also lives in the house and he smells nothing either. I didn't think much of it but it soon got much much worse.      About a month later I woke up in the middle of the night to the worst smell I have ever smelt in my entire life. I have never smelled rotting flesh before, but if I had, I believe it would smell just like this. I could not pinpoint where it was coming from, it smelled this way all throughout the house. It was so bad I woke up my mom because I thought maybe a pipe exploded or something like that. She inspected the house and said she didn't smell anything, neither did her husband. I was very frustrated, because it was so bad I could barely go back to sleep. This continued everyday. It didn't stop, it only got worse.      I couldn't stand it any longer, and eventually I decided to clamp my nose shut because there was no other way to escape this horrid smell. Even when I would step outside, I could still smell it, as if the smell was everywhere in the air. But when I clamped my nose shut and breathed through my mouth, it was like I could sort of taste the smell on my tongue if that made sense, which was even worse. It was an acidic like taste, a subtle spoiled taste. Kind of like sticking your tongue in a cup of milk that had sat out in the sun for days on end, but it also had a weird meaty undertone to it and it was so bad I almost vomited.      Since this has begun, my quality of life has degraded a lot. I am always miserable, not only because of the fowl smell that I can't escape but because it has also lead me to go into some scary places. To a lot of you it's probably just smelling something bad but to me it made me question whether or not any of it was real because everyone denied smelling it. It has made me question myself even. I remember one scary time very late at night, I had began thinking that maybe nothing was real including myself, which launched me into a bad panic attack, and then everything I looked at in my room was suddenly very scary. For example, my blanket which was on the floor horrified be to a very extreme level because I could subtly see a scary face in it.      I have always had issues with being depressed, since about third grade, and this has made it a lot worse, some days I don't even move, I just stay face-planted down into my pillow trying to ignore these terrible sensations. My mom believes I am overreacting, and that I just have a sensitive nose but it is so much worse. She and her husband are both at really high risk, so like me they don't leave the house much, and she says she's not going to risk going to the hospital and getting covid just because I smell something gross.      One of my friends I talk to online suggested it could be carbon dioxide, but it isn't because we have an accurate detector with working batteries. I should know, I check it every week. So what else could it be? This has made my life so awful, it's unbearable living this way, and ever since this began I have had sort of existential crisis especially at night. I feel like I am in one big nightmarish limbo and I don't know what else to do.\n\nAssistant:"

Bizarre things have been happening to me lately in regards to my mental health and It's scaring me I'm a 19 year old from the United States, the East portion to be precise. I'm fairly certain I'm Bi-Polar, but due to my parents being... not huge fans of psychology or doctors themselves, I haven't exactly gotten the chance to get a diagnosis. I have pretty much every symptom/behavior from bi-polar disorder, and my mother's side has a couple bi-polar people, along with my father's father. Also unrelated, I have anemia. But I've been, due to some weird stuff happening, thinking that maybe I'm mis-attributing these behaviors.  I was working for a while, and it put me under a decent amount of stress. During that time, I started having an issue where I'd hear people yelling my name from behind me at distances. I would find myself responding with \"Yea?\" or \"What?\" a couple times a week, and nobody would respond, so I eventually just stopped responding to it. I noticed that when something is making white noise, like a fan beside my bed, I'd hear very clear music and voices. I got so scared by them a few nights I slept on the couch without my fan. It was like a music box type thing with people mumbling in the back, completely 100% clear, like it was next to me.  When I quit my job, things got slightly better. I'd still hear the sounds of music from my fan, and the name calling got lighter. However, unrelated stress now has made me a lot more stressed than I was at the job, and things have gotten worse. I have developed this bizarre habit where I rock the upper half of my body back and forth unconsciously, and I have to force myself to stop, but for some reason it feels nice. I've never had anything resembling this before. It's not like a slight, hardly noticable thing, it's rocking back and forth like a full foot and a half at a decent speed.   A couple nights ago, I got extremely anxious about sleep like I used to when I was working, and I couldn't control where my mind was drifting. I outright couldn't. I couldn't stop thinking about a song and different interactions between characters for a game I play. It sounds really weird and it was. It was like the usual daydreaming I get, but I outright could not stop myself from thinking of it. It was fucking awful and wouldn't go away for hours, even though I had been up for around 36 hours and was desperately tired. This has happened a few times. It's absolutely awful not being able to control my thoughts. I have gotten these weird shakey periods where my hands shake and my legs feel iffy to walk on, and the shaking makes it difficult to type or do dishes. I've again, never had something like this happen to me before.  I don't know or think this is related, but I've been having very weird random pains, like I'm being poked really hard inside of my body, like in my arm, my lungs, my chest, my neck, etc. and I don't know what they're from. They're really painful, but I think they're most likely from my anemia.   I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm losing my mind and I don't want it to get worse. I feel like over the course of the day I become like 3 different people over the course of the day. I can't control my emotions and sometimes my own thoughts. I'm hoping this isn't schizophrenia, but the shakes, rocking, and hearing things make me think it might be. Please help. Thank you for any responses.\n\nAssistant:"

It felt like something was stuck in my rectum and I couldn\u2019t get it out. The only stuff that managed to come out was this very thin, gelatinous, clear-ish mucus that had liquid feces in it. Throughout the week I tried taking Miralax, and when that didn\u2019t work, I resorted to a glycerol suppository. That didn\u2019t work either, it just gave me really horrible gas. This went on for 5 days until I went to the doctor, who told me to take ex-lax, which she claimed works like a charm. She told me to take two sections of the chocolate bar, which I did. For hours upon hours, nothing happened. Every time I felt like I had to go to the bathroom, it was just a lot of gas and a bit of that poop-mucus. I was getting frustrated at this point so I went to bed on Thursday night and when I woke up in the wee hours of Friday morning, it was like Niagara falls coming out of my butt. Well, even though it worked, I still have horrible diarrhea even as today is Sunday. It\u2019s like I went from one end of the spectrum to the exact opposite. There is still a LOT of mucus in my stool, I have horrible gas that won\u2019t let up, and if I press down on my lower right abdomen where my intestines are, it is very painful. What can I do to improve my state? My butthole is burning from the pooping and the wiping, and I\u2019m exhausted from getting up every 10-15 minutes to use the bathroom.\n\nAssistant:"

My mom and I are considering doing an autopsy which will be about $400. So here's the backstory, my dad was diagnosed with cancer early June. Due to various up and downs he was finally able to get a stent put in and start chemo the second week of August.  The chemo he was on was very strong...very strong. While he was on it his hemoglobin dropped from 10.3-11.2 to 7.1-7.9. So the doctor suggested changing his chemo medication and using a chemo pump. I was unsure about this and ask my dad to get a second opinion. Our second opinion doctor suggested we keep on the medication but lower the dosage by 40%. Because he didn't want to divert from the actually medication for his type of cancer.  We went to the doctor and asked about it but he stayed firm on switching the medications. So my parents liked the guy and trust so they switch the meds. My dad felt great, but each appt I would ask them to get updates scans to see if the chemo is doing anything to the cancer. They would ask but the doctor kept pointing to how the tumor markers were going down.  I then came in and said I want an updated scan he mention the tumor markers but I stayed firm on the scan. So 4-6 cycles on the new chemo we got a scan, and the scan showed that the cancer was unchanged.  The scan really didn't matter because the next week started my dad's downward spiral. We were constantly in the hosipital, getting blood cultures, and blood tests. He was at the hosipital for about 5 days, and when he got out he saw his oncologist assured him that everything is fine because the tumor marker CA 19-9 went from from 3600 to 2000 (there was another tumor marker that was rising but he kept mentioning the one that was declining) so he told him to come back on Wednesday to get his chemo. Bare in mind he was at the hosipital for 5 days, wasn't eating right while there and dropped some weight.  After that chemo session his down spiral felt like a cliff. It was bad, he wasn't saying much, speaking words not sentence. He heart rate stayed at 125-135. His temp stayed around 99 degrees.   We took him the ER again this was three weeks ago. When we got there he was admitted and they ran tests and blood cultures they found an infection gram negative rods I think the called it.  But here's the thing that shocked us. They just looked at my dad's chest and felt it and pulled us aside and wanted us to consider goals of care because they said he was in bad shape. That the cancer is really bad. Mind you we never heard this from the oncologist. They did a ct scan and where the cancer has spread and how bad it really is. They mention is WBC being in the 20-30s. We were taken a back.   We thought it was misunderstanding. This was the first time they are seeing him. Because the oncologist knows his WBC has been elevated and has said it's because the cancer and that the tumor markers are down so we are on track.  I had a phone call with his oncologist that day before he was discharged to find out what the heck was going on. He told me he got the updated scans and that he's looking at his old one and they seem to be the same. That there's no real difference.  So the next day my dad was discharged and the following day he had his appointment with the oncologist. He told him that the scan looks similar he couldn't make the liver but he can do a scan for that in a week or two. Mind you my dad has been really confused and delirious at night and referencing things about his childhood as if it was present day.  He mention the tumor markers again and how it dropped to 400 and told me dad as long as he eats well we should be on track to start chemo again.  So to sound like a broken record a couple of days after this we go to the hosipital again. His hemoglobin is 7.3. We talk to the oncologist he says to take him to the hosipital where he makes rounds out at that he would have more pull there. My mom does it. The one I prefer at the second opinion doctor would take to long to get to since it's rush hour.  We head over there and they do chest xrays and everything and just tell us it's bad it's really bad. They really want us to consider goals of care. We told them what the oncologist said about giving him blood, a TPN, and draining his fluid again(the first drainage yielded 1.8 liters.)   So they are doing what the oncologist suggested all the while the primary doctor is telling me that I need to talk to my mom about goals of care. So after the blood, the TPN, and the drainage(only 60cc this time, because the fluid is in too many pockets) we start to consider goals of care because my dad is no longer talking just breathing.   The hosipital did the updates scans we wanted and what we found was an infection in the liver. The cancer just all over his chest area. And they ran blood work to let us know that his kidneys are starting to fail(it was 3.3). That his sodium, magnesium, potassium, and etc levels are out of whack. This was Sunday. Mind you we went to this hosipital and still haven't seen the oncologist.   On Monday he's creatine level was 5. Monday night we finally see his oncologist who says that goals of care was the only option. And consoles my mom. I was livid. My dad's friend was there and my younger brother. If I was there I don't even know what would happen. I got there a couple hours later but told my mom it would be best if I didn't see the oncologist ever again.  So my dad was gasping for air and just couldn't breathe right. He was just in this state. Not say anything, his mouth open, his eyes wide open so they mentioned comfort care so that's what we did he was on a 3ML a hour of morphine monday night and passed this Tuesday morning.  So now I want to do autopsy. I'm getting all his records, his scans, his blood tests, and I'm a going to meet the second oncologist so I can get a second opinion on everything that was done. Because this whole thing doesn't sit right with me.  So my question is should I do an autopsy too? Or am I good with just his scans and blood work?  - Age: 63 - Sex: M - Height: 65 in - Weight: 155 lbs (With fluids) 138 (Without) - Race: African - Duration of complaint: 3 weeks - Location: NJ - Location on body: Liver, Gallbladder, Peritoneum - Existing issues: Diabetic, Hypertension - Oxycodone, Atenolol, Novax, and Heparin shots twice a day\n\nAssistant:"

I... your story just struck me as familiar and while I can\u2019t offer any medical opinion, it didn\u2019t seem strange to me.  My deepest condolences."

If someone at your practice, or a peer, or a doctor who is an acquaintance were to tell patients this while treating them for psychiatric issues?   After a 130 minute 1st session with a psychiatrist that was supposed to be 90 minutes, I was told not only what the title says, but things about the WHO and China working on spreading the virus; hydroxychloroquine is a real cure that we're not allowing because Fauci and the CDC want to kill Americans; that countries in Africa and Southeast Asia have found and used real cures - that there won't be another wave (later that day reports of the first second surges in Europe began coming in). I was told everyone - including me - should be taking hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic.   This was a woman who was supposed to help me deal with my Bipolar disorder and GAD - instead, I was forced to listen to a long rant espousing what I recognized as very radical alt-right, QAnon style conspiracy theories. I tried to look up to see if others had ran into this with their psychiatrists, therapists or doctors - I found nothing, though I did run across many psychiatric studies about how mental illness is typically an underlying cause for belief in such conspiracy theories.  I fired her two days later when her secretary called, and I told her what the psych had told me and asked that it be passed to her superiors. I also told my therapist, who isn't associated with them and runs a private practice; and the shock on her face when I told her was something else - she became very serious and asked for the woman's name and then thanked me for 'making her aware of this problem' as if she might do something.  How are alt-right conspiracy theorist medical professionals to be handled? Did I do the right thing? Should I pursue this - is there an ethical obligation to draw greater attention to a supposed mental health expert who is espousing such theories to her patients?\n\nAssistant:"

Please help me. 23F, 165.1cm, 138lbs, White British (UK) Duration: Since ?birth Severe acid reflux which has got worse since January; EXTREME WEIGHT LOSS OVER 42LBS. excessive violent vomiting with red/coffee ground blood sometimes, upper abdominal and chest, shoulder, upper back pain.  **Thank you so much for taking your time to read this, I know it\u2019s a long post but please take your time**  Medical conditions: Atrial septal defect(tiny aneurysm), heart Murmur, Acid reflux, Anxiety. Meds: Omeprazole 80mg, Gaviscon maximum dose as and when required, Pregabalin 50mg 3x per day, Trazodone 100mg x1 per day. I Don\u2019t drink or Smoke or take any drugs.  Treatment I\u2019ve received: Barium swallow, PH testing, endoscopy functioning test, Endoscopy camera test.  I am desperate for any advice or answers to what\u2019s happening with me; I am sorry for the long read, just don\u2019t know where else to go from here.  I put a post on here previously asking advice about my condition, and I got loads of helpful replies- and went on to lose an alarming 42lbs over 4 months.  My gastroenterologist specialist has been very careless with my case, and I have been told to report him as he made me wait a whole year for my endoscopy.  I had an endoscopy(without the camera) down to test how strong my oesophagus was, I had a barium swallow aswell which both showed up perfect also my barium swallow showed no ulcers or hernia, But I also had an oesophageal pH monitoring test done which is to be kept in for 24hours and you get given a diary and a monitor you\u2019re attached too, which you can record your symptoms in e.g whenever you feel pain, whenever you eat, whenever you lay down and sleep etc; I ended up becoming severely ill when I had this in and had to rip it out after 17 hours as I was projectile vomiting everywhere and in absolute agony. I had my results back from this test which showed I *DO* have some reflux, but I wasn\u2019t experiencing reflux when I was vomiting, or the pain I was recording wasn\u2019t showing as reflux either..? My doctor has said to me that because of this, if I was to be referred to the surgeons they could reject me as it\u2019s not solid evidence of this being reflux and being treatable from surgery which I\u2019m so upset about... I have now finally had my endoscopy camera down, which has shown my upper GI tract as normal and healthy, (I am still waiting for the full report and study, but that was told to me by the nurses after my treatment)  I\u2019m now lost on what to do now? What other investigations should be done and what can I ask for?  As my current gastroenterologist is trying to shrug my problem off as a \u201cfunctional oesophageal\u201d problem, even after multiple GPS have told him they disagree with this, he isn\u2019t listening to anybody. I also feel my symptoms don\u2019t match up with a function problem either?  My symptoms start as Sulphur burps, then I get upper abdomen pain, then chest pain going into my back and shoulders, then I will get gassy like farting constantly and burping constantly and my stomach is constantly churning and gargling, then I have frequent loose stool around 8-10x. Then of which I will be rolling around screaming and crying from the pain and projectile vomit everywhere multiple times, and it sometimes looks like undigested food? Or bloody; and the smell of my vomit is more extreme than normal vomit, boyfriend describes it as battery acid with rotten eggs, it doesn\u2019t smell of vomit at all, also very sweaty but cold skin. I have noticed one of my triggers are pineapple.. I Have been admitted to hospital multiple times when this happens, and every time I have hypertension, and tachycardia hitting at least 180BPM. Another thing is, after I eat I\u2019m extremely wheezy, and cough a lot, there\u2019s a loud audible bubbling in my chest.  I\u2019m desperate for answers, please if anyone has any solutions or maybe answers to what\u2019s going on with me?  Any tests that I could ask to have and what my rights are to receiving these? Or any knowledge of what could be happening with me or conditions, it would help so much, me and my family are worried sick and feel I\u2019m slipping through the cracks.  Thank you so much for reading this post, I hope you have a lovely day.  I was tested for H.pylori 6 years ago and was negative, they didn\u2019t test me again yesterday for it. Negative for Celiac disease aswell, no link to my menstrual cycle, no hernias found, or polyps, or ulcers. also I have tried different antidepressants, and the problem has still been there even before I was on them tablets. I have also tried a plain diet and eliminated food, the only food I\u2019ve linked to my problem is pineapple. Also, mental health wise - I\u2019d like to think it\u2019s not related as I\u2019ve possibly had this since birth as I used to have to have gaviscon in my milk to thicken it up; and my symptoms got extremely worse when I was 10. My symptoms aren\u2019t usually triggered by my moods/mental health.\n\nAssistant:"

Need advice on how to help her. This one is a bit long, but please bear with me, I wanted to make sure I don't miss any important information that might be insightful.  About 8 years ago I became friends with a lady who told me she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis after she had a fainting episode and then partially lost her vision temporarily, she went to the ER and following medical diagnostics (MRI, tests) was diagnosed with MS. In the next few years she'd share with me her progress/MRI results as she would experience periods of recovery and then relapses/flare-ups. At that time she was very physically active, doing biking events for MS awareness and such. About 4 years ago she began living with my family (to save money on college etc) so at that time I would be able to see her every day; while she'd occasionally have periods of fatigue and difficulty walking, barely noticeable tremors, there was never an occasion that we'd need to help her move/go up the stairs. All this time time she was on MS medications, sometimes switching from one to another, changing dose, etc. Cut to spring of 2020, up until this time she still kept being very physically active, doing workouts/light weight training almost every day at home. She started being unhappy with some of the side effects of her MS medicines (some made her heart beat very fast, some made her face flush red), and I suspect somewhere around this time is when she stopped taking her meds. By summer 2020 I started noticing her tremors became almost always present instead of only occasional, and she started having occasional difficulty walking. By the beginning of fall 2020 those symptoms worsened, we'd almost always help her unload her groceries from her car and bring them home. She could only occasionally do physical exercise. By the end of fall and up until now she could no longer walk without support and would often fall (2-3 times a week). She works from home due to the COVID-19 measures so that works out well, but she almost never leaves the house, has groceries delivered, and sometimes needs help having food brought to her room in order to not spill things because of her tremors.      Now for the CLD part. At one point, I believe in the spring of 2020, she visited an OBGYN and shared her frustration with MS, he suggested she check if she might have Lyme disease. She went ahead and researched online, brought it up with the doctor that was treating her MS, was told that she didn't have Lyme (they may or may not have done the test for that back when she was diagnosed with MS, her retelling of it was confusing, but she believes the test they did had evidence of some infection and the doctors didn't report on it, instead calling it MS. I'm inclined to think they did do the test since we're in an endemic area and it came back negative, but I don't know this for sure). She kept on researching online and discovered the CLD community and what I can only tell is an aggregation of misinformation and faulty research that claims some big pharma and CDC conspiracies about Lyme disease. Reason I know this is she told me about it and also asked me questions about how CDC and FDA operates and what it means if a test is FDA-approved/CDC-recommended (I work in the biotech field and happened to be working on a EUA submission for a test, so had a bit of insight) and most importantly what it means when a test is NOT endorsed by CDC and not FDA approved. Cut to the chase, she went ahead and ordered an IGeneX test for Lyme and co-infections and got a positive result. I looked into the test and found my own concerns with it (56% false positive rate being the biggest one), but since I'm not a doctor I told her to bring the test to one and figure out how to go from there. I don't think she ever went to one, or at least not one that's not \"Lyme literate\" as I found out the term.  I looked into it and as far as I can tell the CLD isn't a recognized diagnosis and people are self-diagnosing themselves with it because doctors can't find what's wrong with them. At one point she claimed she saw \"worms\" in her stool that looked like \"spirochetes\", which, having worked on leptospirosis, obviously baffled me since AFAIK we don't have a microscope in the house, and when I pointed it out she claimed that it was a \"biofilm.\" When I asked how she could tell that she said she saw pictures on the internet. In general, whenever the conversation got to this subject and I would ask legitimate questions about the claims she made she'd turn rather defensive so I decided to avoid asking any more questions.      What worries me is now she wants to go from harmless alternative treatments (scrubbing herself with a loofah before a bath to detox the surface of the skin, taking daily 2 hour salt baths to detox the skin/body, eating garlic to kill bacteria in her blood, taking herbs, vegetarian/vegan diets, drinking crazy amounts of water that send her to the bathroom every 30 mins) to potentially dangerous stuff like long-term intravenous antibiotics. She is only 28, underweight, can't walk without support, I had to lift her off the floor the other day because she fell while getting out of a bath and couldn't get up. I fear she might die, but I realize that if she's in what honestly seems like a cult, no matter what evidence I bring to her I'll get the backfire effect. She doesn't have any relatives in the US and I told her I will help her in any way I can but I cannot support and agree to what as far as I can tell is dangerous misinformation that's making her sicker every day.      I would very much appreciate any and all advice on how to help her. Thank you.\n\nAssistant:"

I was in grad school at the time and was actually working on tick borne disease related projects which might be the only reason why I didn\u2019t end up drinking the kool aid so to speak, but I could see why someone might. Especially if they don\u2019t have a strong background in the sciences.   In my case, it did turn out that I had Lyme disease, but seeing a \u201cLyme Literate\u201d doctor really threw me through a loop. Despite being a board certified ID specialist and a graduate of a reputable school, this Doctor was characteristically odd. She was insanely disorganized, asked very leading questions, and connected several things in my medical history that likely had nothing to do with each other. Upon walking out of her exam room, I had a diagnosis of Lyme disease (from a prior test ordered by my PC), as well as likely bartonellosis, Epstein Barr reactivation, mold sensitivity, a three month prescription for ceftin, and an order for a spinal tap.   I was then invited to a Lyme disease support group meeting run by the doctor that started shortly after my appointment in which several other \u201cchronic Lyme\u201d sufferers lamented about their vague health issues and spouted medical jargon ridden nonsense they read on the Internet that maybe could seem to make sense if you didn\u2019t know anything about infectious disease or medicine. To my surprise the doctor reaffirmed almost all of this.  I walked out of that doctors office in shock and called my PC the next day for a referral to another ID specialist for a second opinion on things as I was pretty terrified to get the spinal tap done. I was seen later that week and had a lot more blood tests run that came back negative. I was told to take a fraction of the prescription the \u201cLyme literate\u201d doctor prescribed to me and that the spinal tap was completely unnecessary. I finished my prescription and have been relatively healthy since.  There\u2019s a lot of misinformation out there and a lot of people who desperately want an end all be all cure for their ailments. There\u2019s also unfortunately a lot of doctors out there that will see dollar signs in place of their patient\u2019s vulnerable states. You certainly have a right to be concerned."

(21/M) I am a 21 yo male, who was born missing my right leg (Amelia), I use forearm crutches to walk, and I have since 6th grade (12 yo). I am a tad on the heavier side than I would like to be (143.5lbs which is overweight) but I am fairly agile and am capable of biking 20+ miles in a single day.   I'm curious as how to go about calculating my daily TDEE with my condition. I haven't had much luck from any fitness professionals and I honestly don't seek treatment for my condition considering that there is no cure, and prosthetics aren't applicable due to the fact that I am missing part of my hip. I have no clue where to go from here, but I'm 40 pounds heavier than in high school and I feel rougher and my joints hurt like mad and I know that intuitive eating isn't optimal for me.   So this leaves me with three questions:  1. How do I calculate my daily calorie needs?  2. Do I need to adjust the amount of calories I log as burning based off the excersize adjustments?  3. Is there a way to properly calculate my BMI besides adding 14% of my body weight to my weight?  My apologies for the random question and if this is the wrong subreddit, I just have no idea where to look for these answers, I've never gotten any helpful answers from nutritionists/coaches and Google is a lost cause for me.\n\nAssistant:"

Are there illnesses that mimic Alzheimer's? Age: 89 Weight: 120 lbs Previous health problems: minor UTI  Location: USA Duration: 5 years (for Alzheimer's)   So, I am just perplexed and I have no idea what is going on. My grandmother (who is 89) was thought to have Alzheimer's.My cousin who is a doctor, aunt who is Psychiatrist, mom who is a nurse, and myself (not a medical doctor, but a doctorate in the biological sciences and work in environmental health) all swore by this. Her behavior (inability to have a deep conversation, or respond to her environment, walk to places on her own, mostly reflected this). I say mostly because there was something (in hindsight) that I noticed. When she would see me, she would call me by the pet name that she gave me. In addition, my ex is a nurse who specifically worked with patents with Alzheimers and dementia, and while she said she believed she (my grandmother) had Alzheimer's, she also swore that \"she was there more than we thought she was\".  Anyways, three days ago she went to the hospital due to a UTI infection....and yesterday, I swear it was like none of this happened. She was entirely \"here\". She spoke and had normal conversations like before her diagnosis, she read (like before her diagnosis), she knew about everything happening in the world at this time (her family fled the Iron Curtain so she was interested in Ukraine. She also remembered everything my family would talk with her about when she \"had\" Alzheimer's. Perhaps the strangest thing, is that before, she was a pianist and had a grand piano and would play every night. She played piano...and she played beautifully.   Look, I may not be a medical doctor, but I am a scientist so I am not going to use the word \"miracle\" but it felt miraculous. At the same time...there has to be an explanation. Obviously in the next few days my family are going to try to figure this out. But in the meantime, I am just left wondering what happened? What did she have beforehand? And why is she suddenly better? It feels like a strange restart in life, like another chance to get to know her and I am simply perplexed.   Thank you\n\nAssistant:"

I (34M) have an extremely severe case of periodontal disease. I am on the verge of losing all my teeth. Bad genes, no dental checks since 7th grade due to extreme fear of dentists from a bad experience as a child, was a pack a day smoker from age 22-30, crushing bouts of depression(compounded by this situation), and I'm paying for all of it now. Have had Bruxism/TMD since I was a child, never knew how to treat it. Also have an issue with dry mouth and it wasn't until the visit to the dentist last year that I learned that it's terrible for your teeth and gum health.   My last visit was last May when the dental office told me what was happening with my teeth. I went in bc one of my canines fell out. That's when I rushed into a dental office and they broke the bad news to me. Told me I was going to lose teeth and basically told me I was going to have to get dentures while doing bone graft and then do implants down the road. Or partial dentures attached to whatever teeth I might have left. Grim. Debilitating. I haven't had any other teeth fall out, but they are mostly loose. I'm terrified and in a constant state of panic. My mental health was taking a dive even prior to Covid, and since Covid started it's just been a downward spiral for me.   It's so frustrating. I can't afford any of the treatment bc I don't make that much, and I'm also paying off debt. Due to debt, my credit is bad. Since my credit is bad, I'm only eligible for $2K from CareCredit.   Dental insurance is useless in my case. I know one of the major risks of periodontal disease is bacteria getting into the blood stream, which is quite a serious issue. My question is since dental insurance doesn't help in my case, will my medical insurance be able to help me when that happens? WHat would you do in my situation? Thanks in advance.\n\nAssistant:"

In a child with a painful hip, a high white cell count can point to septic arthritis of the hip or osteomyelitis (bone infection)  This would usually be diagnosed both clinically and with hip aspiration, or MRI scanning if Osteomyelitis is thought to be the cause.  Immobilising the hip in cast will not treat this condition.   It is possible that I am reading the blood tests incorrectly but if the white cell count is 25 I think you need to recontact the doctor at the very least or bring the child to the nearest largest children\u2019s hospital you can find."

Take gabapentin 300mg for sleep/pain and lorazepam as needed for anxiety.**       **medical issues/hospitalizations/surgeries in rough timeline:**     * scoliosis - moderate * frequent URI/sinus infections/strep. * tonsils and adenoids removed, ethmoidectomy * multiple thyroid cysts, deemed benign * IBS * periorbital cellulitis - multi day hospitalization. Came out of the blue and rapidly. * endometriosis - laparoscopy & ablation/excision (lesions on colon thought to cause IBS symptoms.) * Uterine infection - no cause determined (negative STD panel) overnight hospitalization. Also came on rapidly, no tampons etc. involved. * enlarged liver/spleen found while following up on uterine infection, eventually resolved * pneumonia * Bigeminy suddenly that won't stop - can't sleep, dizzy. Persists for 3 weeks, goes away, comes back and persists for 4-6 weeks. ER gives IV & oral beta blockers that do not do anything. Eventually resolves a week or two after visit.  * multiple unexplained full body rashes, no known contact with any allergen, severely itchy & leaving blood spots under the skin for several days after disappearance of rash. Doctor suggested immune response to an unknown virus both times.  * severe migraine which I previously had no history of, enough to warrant ER as I didn't know what was happening. SUCKED!! BAD!!  **I'm posting because I am at my wits end. Beyond that medical history, my symptoms are cyclical with a few known triggers, since around age 12 and progressively worse, and are as follows:**     * insomnia - does not respond to sleeping medications (i.e. ambien) cannot \"sleep in\" even if going to bed very late. Difficulty both falling and staying asleep. * fatigue - constantly at least mild, often severe. Especially worse if I lose any of the precious small amount of sleep I do get. Not \"sleepy\" necessarily, but physically exhausted and weak. * Dizziness - especially upon standing. Vision goes black, head heavy, heart races, and I have to sit or lean against a wall with my eyes closed until it passes * lactation from left breast only, for years * poor circulation (nerves?) arms and legs go numb with slightest pressure. Cold/numb feet, legs turn purple in the shower. Doing hair is challenging as arms quickly become numb/weak when held up. Hands go  white or purple.  * joint and muscle pain, sometimes severe, especially hands, wrists, hips, knees.  * chest pain * tender muscles, as if strained or bruised with no known cause * trouble concentrating, poor memory * blurred vision. Suddenly/rapidly needed glasses at age 23 after perfect vision for whole life, even stronger prescription needed 2 years later. * hot flashes * nausea * feeling of being about to faint - cold sweat, vision blacking out, weakness, facial tingling, spinning. Have to lay down for the rest of the day when this happens, usually comes on the onset of illness.  Different from dizziness in that it distinctly feels like I am struggling to stay conscious and can hit any time. * Frequent, or even continuous URI, including one going on 5 months now. Including flu like symptoms, sinusitis, fever (99-103 recorded) sore throat/glands. At one point neck glands so swollen and severely painful I could not eat or speak for 2 days flu/strep negative.   All symptoms can be there in varying degrees/combinations on a daily, but within tolerable limits. On bad days I am essentially bed-bound with flu-like symptoms and severe fatigue, often diarrhea. This is always triggered by going to bed too late (for me this means no later than 9pm,) by too much physical exertion, or by traveling (anything stress related, even if I enjoy it.) I am doing less and less of the things I used to enjoy because it's not worth the sickness I know will come from staying out late or taking that walk, etc. I fear I will end up not being able to do my job which is fairly active, I spend all my afternoons and now some weekends as it is in bed recovering.     I have seen infectious disease, neurology, ENT, rheumatology, gynecology, and more. Multiple GPs. I can't get anyone to spend more than 5 minutes with me, and everyone seems to view any symptoms as acute and are not interested in my medical history. I.e. URI symptoms being a cold that should resolve in a week or two, though it has already been several months with no improvement and even worsening.     Results of any MRI, EKG, CAT scan, etc have been normal aside for what has been mentioned in medical history. Blood tests (CBC, nutrient, etc) all normal except occasionally low potassium, minor. Negative for flu every time, negative for tick borne illnesses, normal thyroid function, everything normal. Once I had low Vit D and took supplements to get it back up, did not improve symptoms, but no longer have low D. Only thing abnormal is occasionally low blood pressure.     **Please tell me where to go.**\n\nAssistant:"

I would not put too much weight in that.  My recommendations:  1. Begin by collecting thorough records from every place you have been. Ask for all lab results, doctor's notes, and imaging results as your new doctor is requesting to review these. You don't need to read through all of this, in fact it may just stress you out more as it can leave a lot of unclear information, but you want to be prepared with all of this.   2. You seem to have already done this to some extent. Write out all your past medical history and do so chronologically. Even better if you type out all the things listed on the first two pages here https://www.medschool.lsuhsc.edu/medical_education/undergraduate/spm/SPM_100/documents/HistoryandPhysical_000.pdf  3. Look for a special diagnostics clinic in your state. These are rare and usually found at big academic medical center, but may be worth it for you. They spend more time and specifically avoid the issues you mention of not looking at the whole history. Also most specialists just want to look at one side of the picture, these clinics offer a more balanced view. It is worth a many hour drive if you can find one of these in my opinion. Bringing one and two is critical to the success of those visits also.  4. Think about seeing a psychiatrist. I am not saying this is all in your head or anything like that. I know when I\u2019ve had a rough day I can feel miserable, and it can compound on itself. Having certain symptoms, then trying to live your life through that and also not having answers, is very stressful. It can make whole new symptoms pop up that have to do with stress rather than any underlying disease. Seeing someone can help clarify what symptoms are downstream consequences of stress and fatigue. It can also help with coping with not having an answer, and with the fact that an answer may not guarantee a solution.  I hope these thoughts help and wish you luck and support in this difficult journey."

She will fall asleep during car rides, sitting on the couch, sitting on the bed, etc.  She becomes incredibly irritable and pretty much always says something hurtful during these periods, usually more than once.  Her speech is different in a way that I can't describe.  Honestly, the best way to describe it is slurred.  It's slower.  I would think it's related to being sleepy, but I don't know.    We work together.  This morning, on the way to work, we stopped at the store.  She went inside and came out 5 minutes later and we left.  We took our 9 month old son to the babysitter and started towards work.  She started saying \"I need to stop at a fu_king store, I only have 4 cigarettes left, I'm going to run out because we didn't have time to stop\".  She didn't even remember stopping at the store, and *she went in herself*.  I waited a few minutes and then asked for \"the bag\" - referring to the bag from the store, just to see if she really didn't remember.  She didn't.  \"What fu_king bag?  Your work bag?\".    I also asked her this morning before leaving, \"did (son) sleep through the night?\" because I didn't hear him or anything, and she said he slept all night.  On the way to work, she claimed she was \"so sleepy\" because our son woke up a bunch of times.  But I usually hear at least hear him fussing, and I didn't hear anything last night.  So I really think she didn't remember telling me that he slept through the night, and then said he woke up a bunch of times to try to explain why she was so tired.  I could totally be wrong about this though.    I'll say this...  I know what you're thinking.  Especially once you see her list of medications.  I think it too, but I don't want to believe that about my wife.  I don't have any evidence of it either really, and I wouldn't know how to approach that if it were the case.

I would probably approach this as a concern on postpartum depression on your end, once the current episode is resolved. Start the conversation by asking how she's feeling since the baby was born. Mention that you know that postpartum depression is a thing, and that you've noticed that she sometimes seems forgetful and sad or mad. Tell her that if that's the case, she can always talk to you and you can help. If she asks for examples, tell her something along the lines of \"that time when I drove to the store, you went in and bought stuff, and then as we were driving to work complained about not having stopped\", or \"when you mentioned the baby had slept through the night, and then a few hours later complained about how tired you were because the baby had kept you up\". Make the conversation as non judgemental and open ended as possible. Even if this were a relapse, hinting at it would only make her feel defensive, which would make it less likely that you can help her.   While this episode is happening though, I would also say to be more attentive than usual to your child's needs, as her forgetfulness might extend to forgetting to change the occasional nappy on a timely manner or put up the baby gates promptly."

I have a hard time transferring what I'm saying in my head to speech, and I sometimes don't hear people, even when they're right next to me despite listening to them, unless I'm looking directly at them.  I'm not one to self diagnose, but I've obviously done a little bit of it myself and my symptoms seem to align with ADHD or high functioning Aspergers, as they tend to share a lot of symptoms. I know I need to seek professional help, but with the current situation of the country and economy, paying for it is easier said than done. Does anyone have any ideas on what it may be..?\n\nAssistant:"

I'm mostly popping in to say that Asperger's has, in most countries, been morphed with ASD (autism spectrum disorder), and that the autism community generally agrees that functioning labels (high functioning, low functioning) are bad and should not be used, because if you say someone is \"high functioning\" that is normally to deny them acommodations and help they need, and if you say someone is \"low functioning\" that is normally to deny them agency and independence/privacy.  With that aside, I have autism, ADHD, and Tourette's syndrome, and recognise a lot of what you describe as autism and ADHD adjacent things. You'd need a professional to figure out which it is, if either at all. Therapy and sometimes medication paired with acommodations can help make life easier to handle, and it's much easier to say \"I need specific and detailed instructions because I have xyz\" than \"I need specific and detailed instructions because I'm weird\", just as an example.

Age: 26. 5' 9\",140 pounds.  No current health complaints and a problem-free medical history and no meds.   Having lost my best friend in the world and witnessed how terrible, unfair, and soul-crushing cancer can be, I want to avoid passing on her suffering at all costs -- which seems to be a possibility based on my understanding of how cervical cancer. Here are a few questions that I have been searching online for quite a while without receiving a definitive and trustworthy answer:  1. I understand that her condition was almost certainly caused by a high-risk strain of HPV -- and because this virus can be spread even with the use of condoms, it is highly likely that I have been exposed to that high risk strain, right?  2. Knowing that I have been exposed to such a strain, is it safe (for my future partners) to have sex in the future? If I do have sex in the future, should I inform future partners of the possibility that I have been exposed to a high risk strain? (Doing that might make having an active sex life rather difficult, but it's obviously a sacrificed I'd be willing to make if that's the right thing to do from a medical standpoint.) Any other information I should know about having (or not having) sex?  3. A bit off topic for the post, but how worried should I be about the possibility of penile cancer, which is also caused by high risk HPV strains? Are there any precautions, exams, ect. that I should be taking to protect/screen myself?  4. Apart from asking these questions on the web, I think it might be good for me to speak with a doctor in person...what type of specialist would be most qualified to answer these types of questions?

I studied biology and when I was diagnosed, spent a great deal of time and effort investigating the disease and associated topics. I try not to give personal opinion and rarely share my own circumstances but thought it was appropriate here.  One of the most common misconceptions about HPV is that once you are exposed and had an infection, you're contagious forever. This is not true. I've put together a couple of links and some laymen's explanation     >Disease Description >Most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic, causing no symptoms. **More than 90% of new HPV infections, including those caused by high-risk HPV types, clear or become undetectable within 2 years, and clearance usually occurs in the first 6 months after infection**.Persistent infection with high-risk HPV is the most important risk factor for HPV-related diseases including cancer precursors and invasive cervical cancer.  ~CDC  ...  >What can be said with certainty is that the most sensitive tests available--tests that detect HPV DNA in genital tissues--become negative within 6-12 months in over 90% of infected persons. We also know that once the test becomes negative, the person is immune to catching the same HPV type again, which is further evidenced that the infection was truly eradicated by the immune system. However, it remains possible that HPV DNA (or maybe even intact virus particles) persists in small amounts, too small for detection by the available tests. Whether this happens at all, or in what proportion of infected persons, cannot be known with certainty with available technology. But if infection persists, it almost certainly is in amounts to small to [sic] be transmitted to another person and probably will never re-grow to cause warts or precancerous growth. But in most persons the most infections are controlled by the immune system and most experts believe they are truly cured. For \"quick and dirty\" responses by clinicians like me, the evidence is good enough to say \"cure\" and to reassure our patients accordingly.  ~Dr. Hunter Handsfield  It is unlikely that you would still be infected with whichever HR HPV resulted in your wife's cervical cancer. More than 80% of sexually active Americans will have at least one HPV infection and just under 50% have an active infection at any given time.. It is very, very, very common.  That 10% of people who do not clear the infection are mostly people like your wife and I, struggling to fend off cancer or fighting invasive cancer - not people who wander through life not realizing that they carry the virus. That's because the virus negatively affects women at a rate 8 or 9 times higher than men and in countries where women have access to health care, Pap smears detect persistent infections in women.   It takes an average of 7 to 15 years to develop cervical cancer from a HR HPV infection. Current gynecological guidelines]( https://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Abnormal-Cervical-Cancer-Screening-Test-Results) recommend Pap smears every three years for women under 30 (5 years for women 30+). Feasibly, it only takes one missed Pap to get a woman into trouble.  As for your direct risk of cancer, your risk is statistically much lower than the average woman. [HPV causes about 40,000 cancers per year in the US. 16,500 of those are in men and most of those are oropharyngeal cancers (back of tongue and throat). Penile cancer is actually rare.  HPV 16 and 18 are the most frequent culprits of HPV related cancers and are responsible for about 95% of all oropharyngeal cancers. If your wife had one of these, you have some risk (related to oral sex). The risk of these types of HPV have more to do with the individual than they do with the type of HPV though. Consider how many people are infected vs. the prevalence of HPV related cancers.  Learn the risk factors and be sure to stay up to date with your dentist and doctor visits in case you too are among that 10% of persistent HPV infections (unlikely though it may be).  The vaccine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration through the age of 26. Getting the vaccine after the age of 26 is what is known as prescribing \"off label\" and usually just means that your health insurance company will refuse coverage and you'll have to pay out of pocket.  If you get the vaccine before you turn 26, the vaccine is actually free if you have insurance of any kind. This was part of the mandate of the Affordable Care Act. Vaccines  are part of minimum required coverage and covered in full without copay or deductible.  You may have strong feelings regarding protecting future partners considering your very sad history. I will still tell you about the vaccine's benefit to you directly. They would be significantly lower than they would be for your female partners. Men have particular risk from just two types of HPV and you've probably had one already and are now immune. That would leave one other oncogenic type and the two that cause 90% of genital warts that you would be benefitting from in regard to the vaccine. You may have been exposed to those as well and never knew.  Vaccine coverage in the US is actually unreliable and has a lot to do with politics/ideology of each state.  You can't count on your partners being vaccinated. ~~I think I noticed as I read through the comments here that you were not aware a vaccine existed. That is not uncommon, particularly in men.~~   An alternative is to prolong non-sexual, monogomous relationships for about 6 months and use condoms for a while afterward. This allows you and your prospective partner to clear or address any STIs. The longer you are together and sexless, the safer it will be. That's just math. Condoms aren't a great barrier in regard to HPV (and HSV), but they do help.  Of course, the decision is yours.   I hope you have many joyful days and years ahead."

I am 5'11\" and weigh approximately 160 lbs. For the issue outlined below, I have been to the Mayo Clinic three times and to every specialist under the sun. (Cardiologist, Neurologist, Neurosurgeon, Urologist, Orthopedist, Gastroenterologist (3) and Bariatric Surgeon. I have also been admitted to the hospital 3 times in this span. Blood work, cat scan, x-rays and MRIs all come back normal. (Other than mild Scoliosis and Kidney stones, of which I had known of previously.) I had Partial Fundoplication surgery on June 11th, 2019.   This all started back in December of 2018. I noticed my heartburn was getting worse and  I would also get these bouts of DEEP and intense chest pains. When I say intense, I mean like kidney stone level.  I went to the doctor where they prescribed me Prilosec. I took it and also chose to exercise (cardio, situps, pushups, etc) and eat better. Then, I remember in mid January waking up with this pain under my left breast (like where the esophagael sphincter and stomach sit). I thought at first maybe it was from exercising so let it go for a couple days where it got worse. It didn't hurt to touch and didn't matter which way I moved, it was always there. I went to the hospital and they cat scanned/EKGed me and chalked it up as a kidney stone. Knowing it wasn't I sought out a GI after lots of Googling.  I saw a GI and he conducted an endoscopy and found nothing initially, but took biopsies. A few weeks later (now late February), he said I had Barrett's Esophagus. The fact I was in pain, still didn't make sense. I was on PPIs and the pain under the left breast didn't go away. I started developing this other pain in my sides and back (in my ribs). They feel sore and feel good when rubbed, iced or if I recline/lay down. I would notice this pain would come and go whenever I was standing, walking or driving for too long. I figured this could be either a back issue or neurology issue. The MRI said I did have disc protrusions but my neurologist and neurosurgeon both said this is not causing my symptoms and to go the GI route. They did say it could be Costochondritis.Neurologist gave me Gabapentin and Amitriptyline and it did nothing. I went for some Chiropractic therapy as well to no avail. So, off to the Mayo Clinic.  I should note, in addition to the symptoms listed above, I also started developing chest pain/tightness. Not severe like before, but it would last longer, most of the day maybe. It feels like an elephant is sitting on my chest and it hurts!  So anyways, I went to the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville and saw a cardiologist. The cardiologist did an EKG, stress test and echocardiogram. The cardiologist said my heart looked fine and it was probably all in my head. I stuck with the GI issue at this point. I had Barrett's, there may be something else wrong. I decided to see a doctor at Mayo that specialized specifically in Barrett's. He did a Barium swallow and an endoscopy on me. Barium swallow showed nothing wrong. Endoscopy showed basically nothing. He said everything look good but found a Schatzki's ring. He said this could indicate a Hiatal Hernia. Biopsies came back NEGATIVE for Barrett's. What?!  I went back home and my GI back home told me to go see a surgeon in reference to the hiatal hernia clue. I had a 24 hour PH test done. It showed upright acid reflux. I had a manometry done that showed Ineffective Esophagael Motility and I had another normal Barium swallow. They chalked the motility disorder up as reflux damage. My surgeon then tells me I qualify for surgery. He was INCREDIBLY sure that I had a Hiatal Hernia, despite not seeing one. He said it happens all the time, where they don't see them until going in for surgery. So I went for it.  I had a partial fundoplication and HH repair on June 11th, 2019. After the surgery, he said he found two fistfuls of hernia in my chest. He said he is very glad we did the surgery and give it 6 weeks to eat a normal diet. I was so excited that this would all be over and I could be somewhat normal again.  Well, here I am. Two weeks later. My surgery pains are starting to dissipate and guess what is coming back? My chest pain/tightness and this side/back pain. The same exact pain before surgery. I am incredibly discouraged. How can I live like this? I am a teacher and a coach. I love my job, I love my students. I haven't been to work since January. What if I can't go back in August? I have $0 in my account. My wife is working but I can tell she is getting extremely tired and frustrated at the situation. I want my life back. I was a perfectly healthy man in my 20s before this all started. Now, I sit at home succumbed to all this pain I am in. Please. Someone. Help.\n\nAssistant:"

All of her COVID vaccines and boosters have been Pfizer or Moderna. I think the sequence was P-P-M.   (Note: my SM lives near her children on the other side of the country, so the post-stroke information I have is limited and second hand. All of my information about what the doctor said has been relayed to me from her DIL. Her DIL, my primary contact, is anti-vax.)  My SM has blood clots in her leg for which she takes blood thinners and wears compression hose. She has had these clots for at least 4 years.   The stroke was ischemic. Since the stroke she has started using a walker. She is alert when you talk to her, but she also has delusions about owning 6 homes in a local resort town and she gets her family members and their life events mixed up.   Recently my SM visited a neurologist, who determined that the stroke was caused by the COVID booster. The doctor said the boosters have a higher chance of leading to blood clots (limited googling has only turns up news about the J&J vaccine and clots.) I asked about the clots in my SM\u2019s legs, but the doctor ruled them out because the only damage was to my SM\u2019s brain (would a blood clot traveling through the body necessarily cause damage before it got to the brain? I assumed the brain was more sensitive to clots.)   The doctor said that the stroke was unusual because it damaged both sides of my SM\u2019s brain. She also said that my SM\u2019s cognitive problems were unusual because they didn\u2019t resemble dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s (again, this is second hand from my SIL.) I don\u2019t know if these factors influenced her diagnosis of a booster-related stroke.   Does the diagnosis of a booster-related stroke make sense? Are boosters more likely to cause blood clots? I\u2019m a bit worried about this situation because my SM just moved into an assisted living facility and the doctor has told her not to get a second booster.  TIA!\n\nAssistant:"

Anticoagulants, or \u201cblood thinners,\u201d reduce risk but don\u2019t eliminate them. That is an obvious stroke cause.  COVID vaccines have been thoroughly not linked to stroke risk except for J&J, and in that case specifically with cavernous sinus thrombosis, not more common types of ischemic/embolic stroke.

I filed a formal complaint with the hospital in great detail and made it clear if I were charged for an emergency room visit instead of urgent care we would have more problems.

Doing a D-dimer without good cause can lead to harm, as it may lead the patient to get an unnecessary CT-PA and all the associated radiation and contrast risks that go along with it."

Bit of a heavy one here, but I NEED advice. (Also sorry for the spelling and grammar I\u2019m not the smartest when it comes to that stuff.)  So on the first of December I gave birth to the most beautiful baby girl. She weighed 6lbs 2oz and was the picture of health and happiness. Everything was going perfect until the end of her first week of life , I looked down at her and she was red and wide eyed and flopping her head around in distress... I realised she was choking, I scooped her up and when she was up right and had a few sharp blast to the back vomit started to come out of her nose and mouth, she started crying when the vomit started gushing so I knew that she could breath again. Now this whole incident only last in total 5-8 seconds, but it really shook me. After she was better I was so relieved but I was immediately worried it was going to happen again so I asked my partner/ mum/ partners mum and dad/ friends who are parents / doctors/ midwife/ health visitor and they all pretty much told me it would be fine and she would have cleared it herself if had of been asleep or not watching her because \u2018that\u2019s how babies are designed \u2018 , but they didn\u2019t see it , they didn\u2019t see the fear in her eyes and how she was acting. It was honestly so frustrating to not be listened to or taken seriously about this of all things. Nevertheless even though it went against what I believed, I listened to them and settled myself and made myself chalk it down as a freak accident and told myself that she would have been fine if I hadn\u2019t of helped her.  Fast forward to Christmas Eve and me and my partner where just about to go to sleep, I was actually already drifting off and he screams she not breathing, it was happening again but this time it was way worse , she was wide eyed again and flopping about in distress but this time when she was sat up and patted on the back nothing was happening and she started moving a lot less and her eyes closed, she was starting to turn purple, basically she was about to choke to death. Thankfully after the last time I watched some infant first aid videos, so i asked my partner to hold her head down and I opened her mouth and stuck my finger in and hooked the thick liquid stuff that was in the throat and started pulling it out, she let of one little tiny cry so I knew it was working to some degree so I ran into the kitchen and got the mucus sucker and with one hand used it on her nose and the other hand to hook the stuff out of her throat again . Finally she cried a few times and began to breath and even though she was foaming at the mouth and very weak I could tell she was atleast breathing again , this whole incident last 40 seconds. Once we got her breathing again we called an ambulance, they took her in to hospital and observed her for a while and advised on some changes in food (both the amount and type) and said she should be fine.  Now here\u2019s my problem, everyone said she was fine the first time too, but clearly it happened again and to a much worse degree!  Now me and my partner are taking full shifts so she is always with someone who is awake and fully alert, which is fine but I can\u2019t relax, I spent eight hours solidly just staring at her watching her breathing and panicking every time she moved or made a noise. I genuinely don\u2019t know how I am meant to cope with this fear that she is going to die any second, I can\u2019t enjoy any time with her because I\u2019m so stressed even though I want to be able to enjoy being with her I just can\u2019t over the past few days. I don\u2019t know what to do , does anybody have advice or has anyone been through similar experience?\n\nAssistant:"

I was confused about her cause of death, knowing it was cardiac arrest but what had caused it?  Her toxicology report was completely clean. They found fibrosis on the heart indicative of other heart attacks, at least half a dozen, during the autopsy - but I got a call yesterday saying that she has a genetic mutation.   I don\u2019t know much about this, and now our entire immediate family (me and my parents) must be tested. The mutated gene is PPA2, which lines up right, but the medical examiners aren\u2019t able to give a full cause of death until they test everyone in the immediate family because she has a variant they are not 100% sure about.   I\u2019ve done some research about the PPA2 gene - it seems it\u2019s a big contributor to sudden infant death, but why would it hit my sister when she was 19? The sensitivity to alcohol makes sense, but me as her sister, how much do I have to worry? I drink quite frequently (regrettably) and haven\u2019t had any chest pain, but knowing that we have a genetic mutation in the family has me utterly freaked out - does anybody know anything else about this?   Was there any way we could have caught this before she passed - did she have to take a genetic test?   My sister was 19 and healthy, seemingly. Is it common for somebody of her age to die of a mutation like this? I\u2019m finding endless studies, but no idea how common it is, I want to know as much as possible about this mutation and what it means for my life, and if there are any foundations that support research that I can donate to, or even a program to help educate young people what a heart attack truly felt like, because my sister did not!  Any help is appreciated, and I\u2019ll provide the link to the original post if needed.\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " Hi.  This is a clinical and research interest of mine.   PPA2 is a genetic mutation associated with arythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) and mitochondrial cardiomyopathies. There is an overlap between the two.  The autopsy report you were given supports ARVD. Based on this, your sister DID NOT have multiple heart attacks. Instead, she had a genetic mutation that replaced normal cardiac myocytes with fibrotic tissue. The problem with this is that the normal pathways of conduction become skewed and predisposed her to arrhythmias. I have not seen your original post (I am running into work and wanted to give you this information ASAP). She most likely suffered from a ventricular arrhythmia causing cardiac arrest.   It is extremely important that your entire immediate family get screened for this genetic mutation. Now, even if you have the mutation, you may not have the disease. ARVD has variable penetrance, meaning you can have the mutation but NOT have the disease.  AFTER screening, IF any of your family members are positive for the gene, they need AT MINIMUM an echocardiogram, but should have a cardiac MRI to determine if the disease is present or just the gene. If disease is present, will need a defibrillator.  Again, sorry for the fast response but wanted to give you this info. I am extremely sorry for your loss and all of this stress. Please feel free to DM me with questions or for help interpreting results."

He is slightly obese but in a healthy way.   When he first got sick he was at home and really puffed up and coughing. Other than that he was in good spirits. After about 4-5 days he was admitted to a hospital where they don't have ventilation but oxygen tanks and he has been declining in health there.  His first xray indicated that 1/4 of his right lung was killed off or white and today (about 3 days after admission) we recieved news that he's at 30% lung capacity and requires oxygen at all times.   Can someone please just be straight up with me here and give me some sort of ballpark on the chances to recovery?

It then developed in to severe diarrhoea (approx 20 times a day and just water) from Tuesday until Friday and on Friday he began to pass black tar-like stools.   I took him to A+E on Saturday as he was screaming in pain, passing out and getting confused as well as passing pure red blood (no stool at this point). The doctors gave him 2 litres of IV fluids and some anti-cramping stuff. His blood tests came back 'normal' and he was sent home. He seemed better for a few hours, but was passing pure blood again yesterday (Sunday) and was literally soaking the sheets in sweat in the night, it was so bad that it trickled to my side of the bed and woke me up. Today (Monday here in the UK) he is in screaming agony again, passing pure blood roughly every 15 minutes and is extremely distressed.  I am absolutely beside myself as I can't lose him, but that's how it feels. The doctors seem to be shrugging their shoulders and sending him home to 'drink plenty of fluids' and I don't know if that's because he's going to be fine or if they just can't be arsed to treat him.

The reason the other engineers are leaving is because management interferes with designs excessively. Ex. I almost finished my first project, but they had design ideas and wanted me to change it multiple times.  Another random thing is that I found out this company has been in trouble for messing with employee wages multiple times. They also refuse to listen to the other engineers reccomendations as they want to save money in the short term at the expense of customers.

We didn't have time to build a relationships with individuals, our goal was to find the best candidates, mark their resumes and move on. We knew we could fill the positions we had with great candidates and that we'd get more in the spring and next year. We were not worried about missing out on a great candidate because we knew that there were 2 more waiting in line behind them.   Forming relationships might work with smaller companies, but if it's a larger company and they are busy I doubt that they will take the time to remember you.  However, when we would consider people in your position was when we needed summer interns. So my suggestion is to inquire about those. No harm if they don't take interns, and if they do then it's perfectly fine to ask questions and learn about the company.  Lastly, always remember that in any interview, including career fairs or in person, that you are interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you. So if you don't know how to interview a company, use this opportunity to develop that skill."

                "content": " I accepted my first job offer a few weeks prior to graduating college.  I had some vacation plans after graduation, so I started my new position 3 weeks after commencement.  The job search process involved attending a few career fairs and checking job post boards at the career center on campus.  I handed out *a lot* of resumes during the spring semester senior year.  I'm sure many found their way to the waste bin, but some led to interviews.  Of the interviews I took, some seemed like a fit and some didn't.  There was one company with an office near Gary, IN that I really didn't care for.  Crappy office and rude people.  The companies that I didn't feel fit me also didn't think I fit with them; they didn't send me offers.  There were two companies that did seem like a fit.  The first was a DOT, but they went on a statewide hiring freeze the same week I interviewed, so I never got the offer even though it was all set to be sent my way.  The other company I did receive an offer from, and I worked there for 4-1/2 years.    Those 4-1/2 years were bumpy, exciting, stressful, and emotional.  I made some lifelong friends and future business partners, but most importantly I was able to grow as an engineer.  The opportunity to perform technical work on a daily basis, interface with management regularly, and the freedom to correspond with our clients allowed me to gain well-rounded experience that has led to many new opportunities.  I didn't really continue to look for other jobs after accepting the first offer, but that was largely because there were no jobs.  Many of my classmates took 6-12 months to find positions; a few took even longer.  But today is different than 2008 was, so if I were to do it all again or give some advice, it would be as follows:  - Keep an open mind.  You may dream about designing skyscrapers or developing the next big dot com, but you really don't know what that dream job feels like until you start it.  Give your resume to everyone you can and hear them out.  It never hurts to consider options that you may not have given much thought to before.  - Interview the interviewer.  An interview goes two ways.  They're interviewing you to see if you fit, and you should be \"interviewing\" them to see if you fit.  Think to yourself, \"do I fit here?  Is this where I want to be?  Can I see myself doing this for at least a year?\"  And ask them whatever questions you have.  What will I do everyday?  Is there room for growth?  How soon can I move up?  What kind of mentoring or training program do you have to help me grow into a great engineer?  - Be yourself, and *sell* yourself.  A good \"fit\" is largely based on personality.  If you don't let your true personality shine, then you're misrepresenting who you are and how your personality with mesh with the company you are seeking to join.  Don't sell yourself short.  Job hunting is the absolute worst time to be modest.  You're a kickass student?  Awesome, make sure you tell everyone, \"hey, I'm a kickass student!\"  - Treat the job hunt like a game.  Job offers are points, get the high score and you'll win the big salary bonus.  People weren't hiring in 2008  when I graduated, but they sure are now.  I recommend every new grad get at least two or three job offers before accepting one.  You'd hate to take the first offer that comes along at $40k with a $65k offer right around the corner.  As for looking while you're employed, I've heard it's good practice to stay at your first job for at least a year before leaving.  Every job after that, give them two years of work or more.  You're going to be basically worthless for the first few months at your new job.  These months are an investment by your employer, and they will expect you to stay long enough to earn back whatever money they've spent getting you trained up.  So certainly do not take leaving a new employer after a short term lightly.  That being said, business is business, so don't let a \"rule of thumb\" and being polite keep you from doing what you'd like to.  Sorry for the lengthy comment, best of luck."

If it\u2019s simply an old style fuse, crews may need to walk the entire section (between two fuse points for example) to try to visually find the problem.

A few months ago I was asked how I would feel about replacing her. I said I don't think I have the required experience with the company's technology, but that I wouldn't decline such an opportunity despite the challenges. When the actual offer came along I accepted.

The sheer volume of \"top of your head\" knowledge required for the position is mindboggling to me. I keep getting asked if I understand things, and I answer that it's still new to me and I need to get used to it.

Mistake number 3 came soon enough, I still have my responsibilities as a team member, and because of some unexpected stress from my personal life I dropped the ball on it. I promised to give a presentation on some data that I hadn't even analyzed and only realized last minute that I would never make it. I told my team leader and my boss two days prior to the date, and they managed to move it, but the disappointment was apparent. They also told me that things MUST be done on time for the new date. Since then I've been staying at work late, coming in sick,and working from home to meet the new deadline.  My main concern is that I'm just not cut out for this type of work and that I'm too far into the handover process to pull out. My life has been miserable the past few weeks, I dream about work at night and wake up at random hours from the stress.  I came to this job with an M.Sc and 3 years of experience, but my experience has been working at a university, where management and deadlines are more abstract concepts than actual deliveries.

In general it's more efficient to transmit electricity at a higher voltage.  Usually you won't have a choice on voltage.  It'll already be there and you buy equipment to match.   Or you wire to match existing equipment.   If you have a greenfield site, you'd usually default to the higher voltage (3 phase 480, 575) for anything with high electrical draw.  Lower voltage is used for sensors and controls.   3 phase means there's 3 AC waves, they're staggered 120\u00b0, so 1 wave is always near peak.   It good for motors and makes welders smoother.  Then to blow your mind further there's something called a Y and a delta 3 phase.  IDK what that's all about.   Transformers are really simple.  They are layers of steel sheets.  Each side has wires wrapped around it.   The ratio of wire coils from 1 side to the other determine the output.   A 4:1 transformer would step down 480v to 120v.  I'm not pretending to be an EE.  So I'm sure some of what I've said is wrong.   Just thought the water analogy helps the rest of us."

I graduated in May with a BSEE, and I got a job at a major US defense company working in RF starting in late June. However, because of COVID, most people have been working from home since then, and many new college hires have not been given any work to do. When I started, I was instructed to charge my time to overhead and wait for a task. I got maybe one or two small tasks, did a little bit of helping out and shadowing other engineers in a lab, but mostly\u2026 nothing. I\u2019m four months into my job, and I have been sitting at home collecting paychecks the vast majority of the time. I\u2019m not the only one, either \u2014 I know of others in my exact situation, some of whom have had even less work than I\u2019ve had.   It looks like I might get an interesting task soon, but there is still no indication of a long-term project coming my way. After over four months, I\u2019m getting a little worried. I am really interested in RF, and I was hoping to learn a lot here before eventually pursuing graduate school, but as of now I have no idea how I am going to build my resume.   Can anyone offer advice for what I should do? My supervisor seems incapable of finding me a task (he has been \u201cworking on it\u201d since I first started), but I really want to contribute given the decent amount of RF experience I have from college and previous internships. This huge company seems plagued by internal politics \u2014 individual programs do not want to pay for a newly hired engineer, so the company prefers to have me uselessly charging overhead rather than billing a specific program\u2019s budget and contributing to it.   Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I am unfortunately stuck with this company until next June because of a relocation contract, so I really need to find a way to succeed here in the short term.\n\nAssistant:"

I know you are feeling eager to get started, but I agree with other commenters: do research into any company policies, docs, etc. you can. Ask your manager if there's any compliance training you need to do. You can also ask coworkers for names of the equipment and tools you're going to be using and research those, do any tutorials you can, use this time to become a semi-expert on the equipment specs. Brush up on your programming.  If you have 1:1s with your manager, let him/her know what you're doing, but don't pester too much for projects. It takes a huge load off your manager if they know you can be self-sufficient and find your own ways to add value. This will make them like you because you don't make their job harder. No one is expecting you to be delivering too much right now, that's why you're on an overhead charge number.  If you're in RF, I promise you that you'll be hit with a firehose of info when things pick up. Enjoy the calm. That's where I started and wouldn't change that experience for the world :)"

We are looking for an entry-level engineer who can analyze engineering documents properly and perform following tasks:  \u00b7    Collect, segregate and organize technical data like alignment sheets, O&M - Operation and Maintenance manuals, P&ID -Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams- for mechanical, SLD - Single Line Diagrams- for electrical and other technical documents.  \u00b7       Reviews Client\u2019s documents, specifications and requirements.  \u00b7       Maintains technical files and update client\u2019s standards.  \u00b7      Prepares detail engineering documentation in compliance with the process requirements and technical specifications (equipment mechanical data sheets, functional specification, Standard Job Descriptions SJI, etc.).  \u00b7       Prepares technical specification for equipment maintenance.  \u00b7       Prepares and review mechanical books.  \u00b7       Assists QC entity during Equipment/ Machinery/Packages inspection and Maintenance.  \u00b7       Prepares list of spare parts and consumable materials for procurement (BOQ).  \u00b7       Build asset registry for pipeline systems and components.  My question is this,  Is this what a Mechanical engineer supposed to do? This job is very simple. It's like data entry. I don't know if I am even in the right field. I thought engineers were supposed to go to fields and do site visits, I have been stuck inside an office working on excel. I'm not complaining about that. I'm just worried about progressing beyond this task. Also, my true passion is in the aerospace industry, but due to financial difficulties and family problems, I'm stuck here for the time being. My salary is very low, I just wanna make sure if this job is something that engineers do or not. Please help my troubled mind.\n\nAssistant:"

In this job, learn everything you can about how diagrams are read, standards are written, and how hydraulic systems are designed, measured, and implemented. Understand the red tape and learn how to overcome it. Work on your personal skills and network with other engineers. Be a self-starter and seek as much knowledge as possible from other engineers, the internet, salespeople, everywhere. Automate as much of your job as possible and use that time to learn more about your true passions. Essentially, given the constraint that you are stuck in this position, your progress toward your dream job is mostly on you.  Keep your resume fresh and keep your eye on the market. Look for your earliest opportunity to move to something closer to aero. Then use your stellar recommendations from this company to get the interview."

That's the RADAR's return and that's how targets are tracked. Now imagine many RADAR waves tracking an object very close to the deck. One wave bounces of the object while the rest bounce off the surface of the water. When the target is close to the surface, those other waves blurr the wave that reflected off the object causing the object to be difficult to track. So theoretically, yes you could fly low and avoid RADAR but I'd imagine it's very difficult to fly a 777 at speed at very low altitudes. Also there's a speed and altitude where the dynamic pressure would be so high that it would cause the plane to rip apart or at least cause significant damage to the plane."

The key is not how accurate your building tools are, but how accurate your measuring tools and system are.  With crude tools you simply keep working very slowly towards the desired result you want taking constant measurements.  As someone else mentioned compound measurements are a huge factor in this process.     As long as you have consistency in your measuring you can in time create more and more accurate tools.  This is one reason lasers and optics are so useful.  For instance our CNC EDMs, mechanically (the ways and ball screws) are actually somewhat sloppy in relation to how accurately the machines can cut, but the computers constantly monitor the glass scales and compensate hundreds if not thousands of times a second to correct for this (and many other factors).  So even in the case of CNCs, it comes down to the constant measuring, and not so much depending on the accuracy of the tool itself.   -------- TL;DR You do not need accurate tools, but accurate measuring to get better and more precise tools.  Anyway, someone else mentioned the book 'How round is your circle' I would highly recommend this book as it shows in great detail just how involved and tricky it can be to measure imaginary and real world objects, as well as methods to measure things extremely accurately with crude systems."

When reversing, the system needs another refrigerant metering device (RMD) on the path between the condensor and the evaporator. This could be a capillary, a TX valve, an accurator, an electronic expansion valve, etc etc. This adds cost to the system.  The oil isn't on the cold (low pressure) side (well, traces are, and they are miscible with the refrigerant so should migrate back to the compressor). The oil stays at the compressor, so stays on the hot side.  Cold ambient means that the compressor may need a sump heater to keep the oil warm during times when the compressor isn't running. Not a big deal, but needs to be accounted for in designing a reverse cycle heat pump AC.

The simplest summary (which assumes you already know some basic physics and understand how this reactor works) is probably something like this:  The reactor was operating at a normal, moderate power level. The power level was rapidly decreased by insertion of most of the control rods, and dropped to a small fraction of rated output. Xenon-135 poisoning (which is delayed by several hours following the power decrease, due to the half-life of its parent iodine-135) further decreased the power level over the following several hours, until it was down to only a few percent of rated output. The operators then needed to raise the power level again to conduct their planned system testing. Because of the large buildup of xenon-135 after the power reduction, the reactor just wouldn't come back up to power right away. They removed almost all the control rods, and it was still sluggish due to all the xenon-135 absorbing too much neutron flux. They ended up with pretty much all the control rods out of the core, and still very little power output.  This was a precarious situation. Perilous in the extreme, though they didn't understand the extent of it. The power level started to rise, as expected. Unexpected, however, was the extent of the self-acceleration of the power rise. As the neutron flux started to come up again, it burned off xenon-135 at an ever-increasing rate, thus further raising the power level, thus further raising the rate of xenon-135 removal, and so on. As the power level rose, the heat boiled some of the water in the reactor core. Liquid water which had been absorbing neutrons and slowing down the reaction rate suddenly turned to steam, which absorbed far fewer neutrons, thus raising the reaction rate even further in the areas of the core which were the hottest. This is not desirable behavior. The reactor operators were unaware of this characteristic (the positive void coefficient) because it was considered a state secret.  As the reaction rate suddenly accelerated from very low to very high due to elimination of xenon-135 and boiling of cooling water in the core, the operators tried to shut it down by inserting all the control rods (it remains unclear if this was manually initiated, or if an automated system triggered the attempted shutdown). This did not go well. It turns out that the control rods on the RBMK have a graphite tip on them, ahead of the boron-containing body. So the first parts of the control rods to enter the core were the graphite slugs on the tips, which pushed neutron-absorbing cooling water out of the way and replaced it with neutron-moderating graphite! The reactor operators were also unaware of this characteristic - also a state secret.  In a reactor that was already experiencing a dangerous uncontrolled power excursion, this was the final straw. As the tips of the control rods entered the core, the graphite raised the reaction rate, thus further burning off xenon-135 and boiling out neutron-absorbing water, raising the reaction rate exponentially faster. In a matter of seconds, the reactor's thermal output jumped to many times the rated level, instantly boiling all the cooling water in the core. The resulting steam explosion blew the reactor and the building around it apart.  This explosion caused total reconfiguration of the core, and loss of cooling to it, allowing the reaction to proceed uncontrolled in the pit of debris where the reactor used to be. A second explosion followed seconds afterwards, scattering the contents of the core all around the site. It remains unclear what specifically caused the second explosion and exactly what state the reactor was in between the two, but after these two blasts the containment was completely destroyed and the core was fully exposed to the world."

You give it a semi-generic name that doesn't tie you down to a single industry, for instance \"_______ Tech\" or some acronym that's memorable. Just something that doesn't tie you to Computers, or Aircraft, etc.  Have business cards printed up.  Park a website and every social media account you can - you don't have to use them, just claim them. Tie all of this back to a Gmail account.  It'll likely cost 100-200 a year, but now you have a professional sounding way that when you hear somebody say \"Man, I really need to find a guy who can handle ____\" to step into the conversation, and offer them your services under that LLC's name.  I've done computers, 3D printing, laser cutting, drafting, part design (sheet metal, machined parts, extrusion, tooling, etc), hell - I automated a guys entire house once (and that was the first time I'd ever done home automation) - I'm talking, I was on a job-site before drywall was up running wiring on nights and weekends.  Rather than being \"some guy\" when those professional odd-jobs pop up, you can be \"some company that I've run since 200X\", that can handle that for you."

Here is a photo on file at the library of Congress dated to 13 August 1860. Contrast that with this photo, identified by the Library of Congress as the earliest surviving photograph of the 16th president with a beard, dated to ~13 Jan 1861, about two months before his inauguration. Here he is again in February, just before leaving for Washington, showing a slightly fuller beard.  It's popularly reported that Lincoln's beard was inspired by a letter received from Grace Bedell, a young girl who saw him speak on 15 October 1860 (the story is recounted here in this 1966 NY times article). She proposes the following to the future president (a scan of the original letter can be found here): > I have yet got four brothers and part of them will vote for you any way and if you let your whiskers grow I will try and get the rest of them to vote for you you would look a great deal better for your face is so thin. All the ladies like whiskers and they would tease their husbands to vote for you and then you would be President.  Lincoln's polite response dated 19 October 1860, just prior to the election, is here (source - Library of Congress). >As to the whiskers, having never worn any, do you not think people would call it a silly affectation if I were to begin it now?  I guess to get back to your question, it looks like Lincoln decided to radically change his appearance, *probably* some time between late October 1860 (before the election) and early January 1861 (post-election but before the inauguration). This is notable too, for the fact that he was the first sitting president to sport facial hair (at least from my informal examination of the official presidential portraits - which you can find here and here). Not sure what the reaction was in the public but I can try to sleuth some more sources.  Hope this is an ok answer.  [*small edits for typos and clarity]"

Desert Storm is mostly forgotten at this point, but it really is one of the greatest triumphs in American history.

Everything followed international law: Iraq ignored multiple UN Security Council resolutions to leave Kuwait, and rejected peaceful solutions to the conflict.   And it wasn't obvious that victory would be so easy.

When we look at historic approval ratings, it seems that Bush's was at about 85% when Desert Storm happened, but by 1992, it had fallen below 50%. What happened?

                "content": " Tl;dr: \"It's the economy, stupid.\"  The general consensus is that  there were two key factors in Bush's failed re-election campaign:  **1. \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\"**  In the 1988 presidential election, Bush made that emphatic pledge to not raise taxes. Bush was considered to be a moderate, especially compared to Reagan. This pledge helped establish him as an acceptable candidate to more conservative members of the Republican Party.  The problem comes in 1990 when he supported a tax increase in a budget compromise. He didn't do a great job justifying it to the public or seem to take it very seriously. During the budget negotiations, while jogging, he was asked by a reporter about his tax pledge, and he quipped, \"Read my hips\" and pointed to his butt. He changed his stance in the negotiations repeatedly, and then seemed to back out and leave it to Congress. Ultimately he supported the increase and signed it into law.  This didn't have a massive immediate impact. His approval dipped a bit, but this was before the Gulf War, when his approval would peak at 89%.  But it did have a longer term impact. The tax pledge was a significant reason that Pat Buchanan ran in the Republican Primary against Bush in the 1992 election. Buchanan was a more conservative candidate, and both Bush breaking his word on taxes and the tax increase itself were an issue for many conservatives. The weakened his internal party support.  **2. \"It's the economy, stupid.\"**  The bigger, more immediate issue was that in 1990-1991, the U.S. economy went in to a recession. In response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, the price of a barrel of oil had more than doubled. The spike in prices diminished as the US and international community responded strongly to the invasion and Kuwait was eventual liberated in the Gulf War. But it was enough to trigger a recession in an already weak economy.  It was a relatively mild recession, technically lasting only from July 1990 - March 1991, but unemployment continued to increase even after the recession officially ended. In July 1992, Bush's approval bottomed out at 29%.  This was the election where the phrase, \"It's the economy, Stupid,\" was coined by James Carville, who was the campaign manager for the Democratic candidate, Bill Clinton. The economy was a  major theme of the Clinton campaign. You may recall that the 1992 election also included an independent candidate, Ross Perot, who also ran on economic themes. *(Edit:* u/Woodstovia *has a good write-up about Perot and the political environment also in this thread - check it out.)*  In the end, not only did Bush lose reelection, he lost with the lowest vote share of any incumbent since 1912, with 37.4%.  (Perhaps not coincidentally, the 1912 election also included a significant third party candidate, former President Teddy Roosevelt running as Progressive (the \"Bull Moose Party\"). He came in second behind Woodrow Wilson, and actually outperformed the incumbent President Taft).  **A Couple Sources**  * Goodgame, Dan. *Read my hips.* Time Magazine, 10/22/1990. \\Web.\\] Retrieved from [https://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/10/13/back.time/ on 12/02/2021. * (2018) The Gallup Organization.

                "content": " I'll try and cover a few of your specific points, starting with the fact *Apocalypto* did not intend to portray the Aztecs, but the Maya. The film does (poorly) mash in some aspects of Aztec sacrifice, if only to further its goal of being colonialist apologia and torture porn. Fortunately, the sheer awfulness of the movie makes it a good jumping off point to talk about actual practices of sacrifice.  To start with, there were slaves in the Aztec world and a portion of them did come from slave raids. The whole notion of actual warriors going out to get slaves for sacrifices, however, is a bit ridiculous. While slaves would sometimes be used for sacrifices in particular circumstances, the majority of sacrifices stemmed from war captives. Taking a captive was considered a rite of passage for a young warrior and a requirement for military and social advancement. Note, however, that simply snatching up some schmuck from a podunk village was not a standard practice; the expectation was taking a captive *in battle*. Also, later in the Imperial phase of the Aztecs, certain opponents became so little regarded that even taking several of them in battle earned little more than a shrug, as this passage from Sahagun illustrates:  > And if six, or seven, or ten Huaxtecs, or barbarians, were taken, he gained thereby no renown.   Conversely, taking captive from more formidable opponents, such as those from Atlixco and Huexotzinco (which were coincidentally in the hard-fought borderland with Tlaxcala), earned great acclaim. So the notion of Aztec warriors raiding villages too small to apparently even have maize fields does not make sense.   Once captives were taken there are some scant mentions of using cages. From the same book of Sahagun:  > And there in battle was when captives were taken. When it had come to pass that they went against and conquered the city, then the captives were counted, there, in wooden cages: how many had been taken by Tenochtitlan, how many by Tlatilulco...  So using cages was a real thing, but there's no indication they were anything but temporary measures. For instance, they were also used during the sale of slaves, or when holding prisoners during trials. Captives were not simply rounded up and kept indefinitely like cattle in pens. Instead, captives were treated, well, like slaves, to be housed by their captors until the time of their sacrifice.  Were those sarifices a public spectacle? Well, yes and no. Many of the sacrifices were public events, and some specifically so in a way that demonstrated the power of the Aztec state. Rulers and dignitaries of foreign, even enemy, nations would be invited to witness these displays as a form a intimidation.*Apocalypto* portrays these sorts of events as a wild bacchanal of primitives gyrating in a wild, unhinged frenzy. In fact, if we turn to sources like Duran or Sahagun, we see that even the most public and bloody ceremonies were highly regimented rituals of specific songs, dances, offerings, and adornments, each with its own meaning. There was an aspect of spectacle, but ultimately these were religious rites.  We can see the combination of somber and spectacle in accounts of the \"gladiatorial\" sacrifice which took place during Tlacaxipehualiztli. After weeks of preliminary rituals, captors would bring their captives to a particular *calmecac*, Yopico, in the Sacred Precinct. There the captor would lead his captive up to a raised platform upon which lay a large heavy stone. Tied to the stone and armed with a macuahuitl whose blades were feathers, the captive would face up to four elite warriors (and a fifth left-handed one if he managed to \"defeat\" the four), but would ultimately be sacrificed on that stone once he faltered.  So there's certainly some spectacle there and the whole notion of \"gladiatorial\" combat evokes the Colosseum, but there's some substantial differences. For one, there's some dispute as to the \"public-ness\" of this event. Sahagun mentions no one but the priests and the warriors, which does not preclude the presence of others. Duran, meanwhile, says the \"entire city was present,\" although the location of the particular calmecac where the combat took place was a smaller building off in one corner of the Sacred Precinct, which present problems for mass viewing.   More importantly though, the intentions were different. Even this particular sacrifice, which was among the largest (dozens are mentioned as sacrificed over the course of a day) and the combat making it among the most dramatic, the core aim was not to provide tititallation, but serve both as a sort of graduation ceremony for warriors who had taken a captive and also a way of providing \"sustenance\" to the gods. On that latter part, just as important as the actual combat was the captor taking the blood of his sacrifice, collected by the priests in a bowl, and going from idol to idol having them take a \"drink\" from the bowl. Considering the symbolic impetus of Aztec warfare was to engage in battle in order to \"feed\" the gods, this act not only completed that divine onus, but the entire gladiatorial spectacle re-created the process of warfare/capture/sacrifice. This was not just bread and circuses, in other words."

                "content": " With gratitude to SepehrNS for the tag! I have a couple of earlier answers that might help. The closest one is:  * Since most of our physical and visual perceptions of hell come from Dante or later works, what did earlier medieval European Christians associate hell with in a visual or physical sense?  ~~  Yeah, yeah, Dante always gets all the credit. Don't get me wrong--the breathtaking scope, literary dexterity, theological and political ambition of the *Commedia* make it a suitable and attention-grabbing reference point. But Dante's versions of hell, purgatory, and heaven are deeply rooted in more than a millennium of Christian visions of the afterlife (influenced by various pre-Christian and philosophical traditions as well). For the early Middle Ages up through 1200, in fact, visions of heaven and hell were the single most popular form of religious vision narrative in the Latin west. (They don't exactly diminish in popularity afterwards, but other forms of visions become cultural tsunamis). Don't worry; for this answer I will concentrate on hell. ;)  The Bible does give us the idea of a \"lake of fire,\" but it's remarkably scant on other details. Nevertheless, already in the New Testament apocrypha (texts written a bit later than the canonical NT books), there are extensive visions of the afterlife in the *Apocalypse of Peter* and in the *Shepherd of Hermas*. The *Apocalypse of Peter* is intriguing because it already develops the idea of the contrapasso, or \"the punishment symbolizes the sin.\"   Early medieval voyages to the afterlife often take on, as a whole, the tone of a morality tale. A newly deceased sinner is given a cosmic tour, only to come back to life to spread the message of the joys of paradise/horrors of hell (and, of course, they inevitably clean up their life). One of the innovations of this era, that Dante will also draw out, is the use of hell visions as political weapons. More often this is much vaguer than Dante, like placing all the bishops who buy and sell offices in hell. But there's a reason for that. These visions are written and passed down as experiences that \"actually happened\"--as genuine witnesses to the underworld.  By the high Middle Ages, there's a new wrinkle in the medieval visionary tradition: the idea that \"living saints,\" particularly women, are specially graced by God with divine visions. Although much of the women's visionary corpus is Christocentric, many visionaries receive (or ask for and are denied, as with Julian of Norwich in the 14-15C) a short trip through heaven and/or hell. Women's visionaries of purgatory, meanwhile, often involve these living saints actually *pulling people out* according to God's will and then by their own prayerful and ascetic intercession. Mechthild of Hackeborn, a late 13th century German visionary whose visions of paradise sparkle with gemstones and light, is typically proposed as Dante's \"Matilda\"--that is, that he was familiar with her and her visionary text, the Liber specialis gratie.  But for my money, the best high medieval vision of hell belongs to Mechthild of *Magdeburg*, an independent religious women slightly older than her co-named monastic counterpart. Mechthild has extensive and lavishly described visions of paradise and purgatory as well, but her hell is top-notch. You can read a fair portion of Frank Tobin's translation of it on Google Books (scroll down a bit on that first page), and you absolutely should.  > I have seen a city / its name is eternal hate  > It was built in the deepest abyss / From all kinds of stones of huge capital sins  > ...] Lucifer sits bound by his guilt in the deepest abyss. There flows unceasingly out of his fiery heart and out of his mouth all the sins, torments, sickness, and shame in which hell, purgatory, and the earth are so wretchedly entangled. In the bottommost part of hell, the fire, gloom, stench, shuddering, and all kinds of intense pain are the greatest.  > [...][Lucifer] grabs the proud one and thrusts him under his tail and says: \"I have not sunk so deep that I shall not lord it over you.\" All the sodomites pass down his throat and live in his belly. Whenever he draws a breath, they slide into his belly. But when he coughs, they are expelled again.  > The false saints he puts upon his lap, kisses them hideously...Unceasingly he gnaws the usurer and rebukes him fo rhaving have been moved by mercy. The thief is strung up by the feet to serve in hell as a beacon, but the damned do not see the better for it.  > [...] At the top, hell has a head that is hideous and has on it numerous fierce eyes which shoot forth flames.  Oh, Mechthild!  I introduce that last bit because there is a parallel tradition that passes down ideas of (especially) hell in the Middle Ages: art. Indeed, depictions of hell were a standard feature in church sculpture, generally as part of a Last Judgment scene. And while Dante's \"gates of hell\" have their place in iconography (though note that Satan's jaws have a starring role in the lowest level of hell), Mechthild's reference to hell having a head arrives at *the* iconographic symbol of hell up to the Reformation: the hellmouth. That's right. Long before it was terrorizing the students of Sunnydale High School, hellmouths were [all over medieval manuscripts, churches, and imaginations. Sometimes they are more reptilian, sometimes more lion-like, sometimes just abstract evil with eyes.  As far as conceptions of the afterlife go, Dante's importance is less in creativity and more in sealing the deal. The insane popularity of the *Commedia* and its enduring hold on western imaginations means we are likely to continue to talk of hell in terms of his metaphors and descriptions. But those literary devices have deep and fertile roots."

It all boils down to what one means by capitalism. \"Capitalism\" is a remarkably elastic term that means a variety of things to different authors. Braudel, for example, focuses on long-distance trade and commerce, and consequently finds \"that capitalism has been potentially visible since the dawn of history, and that it has developed and perpetuated itself down the ages.\" Likewise, Weber defined capitalism primarily in terms of rationally calculated profit-seeking behavior. The *Cambridge History of Capitalism*, which I think is fairly representative of mainstream economic historians, defines capitalism in terms of four elements:  > 1. private property rights > 2. contracts enforceable by third parties > 3. markets with responsive prices > 4. supportive governments  Defined in this way, capitalism would seem to exist basically anywhere a relatively free market exists, and unsurprisingly the authors find examples of capitalism going back to antiquity. If one defines capitalism in terms of the existence of private property and the pervasive operation of markets, then one can find capitalism virtually anywhere. Even definitions of capitalism that focus on markets in land and labor, for instance, have to contend with the fact that these are very widespread phenomenon: the economic historian Bas van Bavel, for instance, has found evidence of widespread labor markets in ancient Mesopotamia (cf. his *An Invisible Hand?*).   So there *are* historians, both old and new, who would argue that capitalism pre-dates the 16th century.   There are also historians who tend argue the opposite, that capitalism is fundamentally modern. Generally speaking, these historians tend to be of a Marxist or *marxisant* orientation. They tend to define capitalism in narrower terms, focusing on the relations people form in the process of production. For example, the economic historian and Marxist Robert Brenner argues that capitalist \"social-property relations\" only prevail where the following is true:  > 1. Economic agents must be separated from their means of subsistence. Though they may possess means of production - tools and skills - the individual economic agents cannot possess their full means of subsistence, i.e. all that is necessary to allow them to directly produce what they need to survive. What this usually means is that, at minimum, they must be deprived of ownership of land [...] > 2. Economic agents must lack means of coercion that would allow them to reproduce themselves by systematically appropriating by force what they would need from direct producers.  Brenner is quite famous for arguing that these conditions generally did not hold true anywhere in the world prior to England in the late 15th/early 16th century. This sparked a controversy known as the \"Brenner Debate\" among both Marxist and non-Marxist historians. Even within the Marxist tradition, however, there are disagreements over what exactly constitutes \"capitalism.\" The late antique Marxist historian Jairus Banaji, for instance, has *also* argued that elements of capitalism existed in ancient Rome.   Ultimately there isn't a definitive answer to your question because there is no definitive definition of capitalism that all scholars use. It only makes sense to ask this question with respect to a *specific* definition. For the authors of the *Cambridge History of Capitalism*, both Florence and Rome have elements of capitalism, if not capitalism itself; for someone like Brenner, these are societies that lack the specific characteristics of capitalist production. At the end of the day it depends on who you are asking.  --- Fernand Braudel, *Capitalism and Civilization*  Larry Neal & Jeffrey Williamson (eds), *The Cambridge History of Capitalism*, vol I  Robert Brenner, \"Property and Progress,\" in *Marxist History-Writing for the Twenty-First Century*  Jairus Banaji, *Exploring the Economy of Late Antiquity*"

When we read about military archery, generally we only learn about archers firing mass volleys in the general direction of an enemy army.  Are there any examples from any culture of specialized military archery units tasked with taking precise aim at specific targets at long range?  I've heard plenty of stories of individual archers accomplishing such feats under various circumstances, but I'm not aware of any purpose-built precision archery forces from history.  It's possible to reliably strike human sized targets at 100 yards or more with primitive archery tackle, surely this would have come in handy from time to time, such as when a high ranking enemy came within range or a politician needed defending during a public appearance, etc.\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " The short version is no, they didn\u2019t really, at least not during the Middle Ages (I can\u2019t vouch for earlier, not my area). The medieval battlefield wasn\u2019t particularly well suited to long ranged precision archery \u2013 once everyone was in a melee there wasn\u2019t much opportunity to engage in specific targeted shooting without a huge risk of friendly fire. Archers in fact would often be armed with melee weapons of their own and might join in the fight once things got particularly intimate, leaving their shooting to either covering the advance of the army, forcing a repositioning or disadvantageous attack by enemy forces, or covering a retreating force (although retreating in good order wasn\u2019t particularly common in the Middle Ages so this was probably the rarest of all). In essence they were more of a support weapon than one suited to specific deadly killing \u2013 despite what some in the longbow-fandom might have you believe.   As for assassinations, that raises a more interesting question. I\u2019m going to limit my answer a bit by focusing on the crossbow because it\u2019s arguably the weapon better suited to this task. The crossbow was generally more accurate, much easier to aim, and had the advantage of being able to be loaded held ready while the archer lined up the perfect shot (in theory anyway). The crossbow was also used in a few famous assassinations and assassination attempts, a few of which I\u2019m going to discuss below.   Probably the most famous person ever to be killed by a crossbow is King Richard I of England. On the twenty-fifth of March 1199, King Richard I of England decided to patrol the walls of the Ch\u00e2teau de Ch\u00e2lus-Chabrol. He had been besieging the castle for some time and he may have decided that evening to inspect the progress of his sappers in their attempts to breach the castle\u2019s defences, we can\u2019t know for certain. Whatever his reason he very quickly would come to regret his decision as that evening he was shot by a crossbow wielded by one of the castle\u2019s defenders. Richard was transported back to his private tent, where the crossbow bolt was removed a process which, thanks to the dubious qualities of medieval medicine, badly mangled his arm. The wound soon became gangrenous. While the king lay dying in his camp his forces successfully completed the siege and put the defenders to the sword. Richard died on the sixth of April, just over a week after he had been initially wounded. His heart and entrails were buried in the castle\u2019s chapel and his body was transported Fontevraud Abbey in Anjou, where his father had been buried almost a decade earlier.   While King Richard has left us nothing in terms of a description of how he came to be mortally wounded the same cannot be said for contemporary historians. There are numerous accounts of the death of King Richard I \u2013 after all a king dying in a battle or siege was a fairly rare event even in the Middle Ages\u2013 from which we should be able to reconstruct the events of his death in greater detail. Unfortunately for historians, these accounts often disagree on major details and are often filled with errors \u2013 making constructing a single coherent narrative of the death of the king a difficult task. There are many interesting things to be learned from these accounts, though, and it is worth spending a time here exploring a few of the more interesting and informative ones.   Remarking on his death, the French chronicler William le Breton found a certain poetic irony to his fatal wounding by the crossbow, as he accused the vile Richard of having introduced this most sinful weapon to European warfare in the first place, making it only fitting that it be the tool to relieve Europe of his presence. This theory for the origins of the crossbow is patently false. The crossbow, along with the bow, had been banned in inter-Christian warfare at the Second Lateran Council in 1139, nearly twenty years before Richard was born. The ban obviously was not very effective, Richard\u2019s death is a pretty clear testimony to that, but the Lateran ban adds further confusion to the French chronicler\u2019s statement. It seems unlikely that he would be entirely ignorant of the decrees Council of a major papal council.   It is also interesting to note that this anecdote about Richard introducing the crossbow appears in only one of William le Breton\u2019s two accounts of Richard I\u2019s death. In William\u2019s *Gesta Philippi,* a prose chronicle about the life of King Philip II, he nearly exactly copies the version of events presented in the work of Rigord, another French chronicler who was writing a few decades before William. Rigord\u2019s account is not particularly in-depth and describes how Richard besieged the castle because he desired a recently discovered treasure \u2013 a treasure which Rigord describes as a golden figure of a Roman emperor \u2013 before he was shot and killed by an unknown crossbowmen.    It is in his *Philippidos* where William really lets his imagination run wild and the death of Richard I is a 200 line literary set piece that closes out Book V of this panegyric written to praise King Philip II of France in celebration of his victory at Bouvines in 1214. The relevant passage mentioned above comes as part of a 31-line speech delivered by one of the three Fates who has decided that while her sisters are still weaving Richard\u2019s life she feels it must end. She guides Lord Archard of Chalus \u2013 the lord of the castle and person who we are told found the treasure in the first place \u2013 to discover a hidden crossbow bolt because: \"This is how I want Richard to die, for it was he who first introduced the crossbow into France. Now let him suffer the fate he dealt out to others.\" This speech must be seen within the broader context of the work \u2013 the *Philippidos* is a work meant to praise Richard\u2019s long-time rival Philip II and as part of that work it frequently and vehemently condemns the English king in no uncertain terms. We are told that Richard I was killed because of his greed in demanding the treasure for himself despite no claim to it, and that he had no respect for God, broke treaties, and violated holy days. No crime is beneath Richard in this work, and so the suggestion that he was responsible for introducing the crossbow is just another exaggerated crime of the English king.   The English chronicler Roger of Howden wrote what is probably the most famous account of Richard\u2019s death and his confrontation with his killer. Roger of Howden was an English chronicler probably best known for accompanying Richard on the Third Crusade and providing a detailed account of the expedition. Roger tells us that Richard was outside Chalus Castle preparing for the imminent assault when he was shot by the crossbow, and upon being shot Richard rode back to camp and told the captain of his mercenaries to begin the assault without him. Roger tells us that Richard was shot by a man named Bertrannus de Gurdon and that when Richard learned that he would not survive he had Gurdon called before him \u2013 the castle having fallen by this stage and its defenders captured. We are told that Richard asked him: \"What wrong have I done to you that you should kill me?\" To which Gurdon responded: \"You killed my father and my two brothers and you wished to kill me. Take what vengeance you like. So long as you die I shall willingly suffer any torments you may devise.\" Roger says that Richard forgave Gurdon and ordered him be released, but upon the king\u2019s death the captain of his mercenaries, a man named Mercadier, had Gurdon captured and flayed alive. This narrative is probably the closest we come to having a clear assassin who was determined to specifically kill King Richard.  The historian John Gillingham has suggested there are reasons to doubt Roger\u2019s account of events, however. While Roger has generally been regarded as an impartial and reliable source, Gillingham draws a distinction between what Roger was writing in the 1170s and 1180s from his work in the 1190s. While in his younger years Roger had been intimately involved in Anglo-French politics, by the late 1190s he had retired to Howden in Yorkshire and seems to have primarily concerned himself with regional matters in and around northern England. As such, he probably is not a particularly informed source about events in central France during this period. So while we know Roger was writing very close to the event \u2013 he only outlived Richard by a few years \u2013 Gillingham suggests there is reason to interpret the Bertrannus de Gurdon story as myth."

                "content": " Wow! I can finally provide some help with a question on /r/AskHistorians as a lawyer who does some labor, employment, and wage work, and as a big fan of the show. I can at least give some background on what we know about the show and about the wages Al earned while joking with Griff and taking jabs at the rotund customers.  Let's rock:  Some basics on this for those who don't know: The show ran from 1987 to 1997 on Fox, and was (along with The Simpsons) the first hit for the fledgling network.  First, the income analysis. We can look at this in two ways: How much did shoe salesmen earn around that time, and how much Al Bundy actually earned.  We actually know a great deal about how much Al earned. Al earned a base salary plus commission at the store. We know from \"My Mom, the Mom\" (S03E12) Al earns that way, because he states he earns a 10% commission on each sale. I would say this really tells us how great of a salesman he is, considering how many customers he can insult and still earn those bonuses.   Even better, we actually know Al's base salary! In 'Tis Time to Smell the Roses, S07E23, Al is offered \"a year's salary\" for an early retirement. How much? $12,000. At 40 hours a week that breaks down to about $5.77/hour. Or $231/week. Of course, Peg spent Al's retirement bonus in a single day, as she is known to do, and Al returned to work the very next day. :-(  How realistic was that for retail employees in general during that time? I found data from 1993 Chicago, showing that retail clerks at that time had a mean weekly salary of $278. So, when you add in Al's commissions, it seems entirely realistic!  Just to add in general: The minimum wage of Illinois in 1991 increased to $4.25/hour. So, again, Al's compensation on the show is very realistic. Jefferson approves!  Now, the matter of the family living arrangements. We know that the Bundy family lives in a \"Chicago suburb\". The actual exterior shot of the Bundy house is taken from 641 Castlewood Ln, in Deerfield, Illinois. That home sold in 1998, a year after the show went off the air, for $320,000. What's more, we know from 1990 Census data that average home costs for Deerfield, Illinois, were between $1400-$1500 per month for homeowners with a mortgage. So, unless scoring 4 touchdowns in a single game at Polk High came with a big cash bonus (and BTW that fact is extremely relevant at all times), Al wasn't mortgaging a home in Deerfield (using 30% monthly income as the \"affordability\" figure like most banks).  Uh oh. Not looking good we would realistically see The Dodge parked in that driveway. Historical home values from the county clerk's office suggest that was not a huge sudden increase, either.   So we know Al couldn't swing that particular house, but what about in general? The median home price in 1990 Illinois was $80,100 based on the 1990 Census. But Al didn't BUY the house in 1990. He bought the house sometime before 1987.   Assuming Kelly was a child and Bud was a toddler when they bought the house, which would make sense, they could have purchased it around 1980. In 1980, the average home price in Illinois was $50,004, again using Census data from 1980. Freddie Mac data says the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 13.74% that year (oof). That makes the mortgage payment $466, figuring Al scraped up a 20% down payment. We can reasonably estimate $500 with taxes and insurance.  So now, in terms of a median home price and the Bundy family's likely situation, the show makes some sense. In 1987-1997, Al would maybe be able to \"afford\" that median house he purchased in 1980, as in, make payments, but (especially if he drove most customers away with his fat jokes, and had less commission), it would be a real struggle. The struggle often portrayed by Al's frustration on the show. And why shouldn't he be frustrated? All he wants is to sit on the couch and possibly read the occasional issue of Big Uns (or potentially the special issue with 120 pages - that's 240 \"Uns\"!).  Pointedly, then, the show's realisticness in terms of their home and arrangements might depend on whether Al drew any income as the founder and President of the National Organization of Men Against Amazonian Masterhood.  Further reading? Kelly says reading is for girls who aren't hot. Instead, I suggest watching the show, which is available on Hulu. Grandmaster B approves."

Less than two years later, the Mexica capital fell to the Spaniards after a brutal siege. Thus began the European colonial expansion on the mainland of the Americas over the next centuries. We use this date as an occasion to critically discuss the conquest campaigns, colonisation, and their effects to this day.  Traditionally, scholars have tended to focus on European sources for these topics. In the last decades indigenous, African, Asian and other voices have added important new perspectives: Native allies were central to the Spanish conquest campaigns; European control was far less widespread than colonial period maps suggest; and different forms of resistance opposed colonial rule. At the same time, the European powers had differing approaches to colonisation. Depending on time and region these could lead to massacres, accommodation, intermarriages or genocide. Lastly, indigenous cultures have remained resilient and vital when faced with these ongoing hardships and discriminations.   **Our great flair panel covers these and other topics on both Americas, for a variety of regions and running from pre-Hispanic to modern times: from archeology to Jewish diasporas, from the Southern Cone to the Great Lakes.

Other research interests include early Spanish judicial forms of, and views on control, forced labor and slavery in the Am\u00e9ricas; as well as more generally international Relations and geographical-political delimitations of the Spanish and Portuguese empires.  /u/Commodorecoco is an archaeologist who studies how large-scale political events manifest in small-scale material culture. His reserach is based in the 6ht-century Bolivian highlands, but he can also answer questions about colonial and contact-period architecture, art history, and syncretism in the rest of the Andes.  /u/DarthNetflix examines North American in the long eighteenth century, a time that typically refers to the years between 1688 and 1815. I focus primarily on North American indigenous peoples of this time period, particularly in the southeast and along the Mississippi River corridor. I also study colonial frontiers and borderlands and the peoples who inhabited them, whether they be French, English, or indigenous, so I know quite a bit about French and British colonial societies as a consequence.     /u/drylaw is a PhD student working on indigenous scholars of colonial central Mexico. For this AMA he can answer questions on  Spanish colonisation in central Mexico more broadly.

I study the impact of European trade on indigenous lifeways, the indigenous impact on European politics, and the middle grounds created in areas of peripheral power between the two. I'd be happy to answer questions about the Native alliance and its actions during the War of 1812, the political consequences of that conflict, the fur trade, and the settlement or general indigenous history of the Great Lakes region.  u/Snapshot52 is a mod and flaired user of /r/AskHistorians, specializing in Native American Studies and colonialism with a focus on the region of North America.

                "content": " I'm sure there are several appropriate threads on the subreddit which have addressed this question, however, I would like to offer my two cents, for what that may be worth. We begin first by looking at how Prof Usha arrived at the numbers that she projects. According to the article that you yourself have quoted :  ***\"Professor Utsa Patnaik has estimated the magnitude of the British robbing of India thus:***  ***Between 1765 and 1938, the drain amounted to 9.2 trillion pounds ($45 trillion), taking India\u2019s export surplus earnings as the measure, and compounding it at a 5 per cent rate of interest.\"***  This methodology itself is highly questionable, however, the conclusions that it seeks to arrive at, show that, it follows in the footsteps of a tradition of nationalist-Marxist historiography offset by such historians as Dadabhai Naoroji and Romesh Chandra Dutt, which has attempted to quantify the economic damage suffered by the South Asia (for convenience referred to as India from here on out), if indeed such a thing could be quantified.  The argument discernible from the methodology quoted above is certain. Britian siphoned off the profits accrued owing to export surpluses generated by it's Indian colony, in essence, \"robbing the colony\". Though the numbers may seem fantastic, Irfan Habib in his, *'Studying a Colonial Economy - Without Perceiving Colonialism',* Modern Asian Studies,1985, pp. 375-6, quotes a figure to the tune of Rs. 1,355 million for the drain in 1881, in 1946-47 prices.  The numbers have varied and so have the methodologies. Usually the attempt has been to portray the expenditure of the Indian government for financing public debt, military forces, infrastructure, payment of remittances etc. were unjust \"robbing\" of the colony's resources and revenues, which rightfully belonged to locals, or Indians.  We can first look at how the number has been arrived at, namely the figure of $45 trillion. Here I'll be using quotes by Prof. Patnaik, in her own article, in the \"Monthly E-Newsletter \u2013 Amity Business School, Volume V, Issue I, October 18\", titled \"How the British Impoverished India\"   > After decades of research I find that using India\u2019s commodity export surplus as the measure and applying an interest rate of 5%, the total drain from 1765 to 1938, compounded up to 2016, comes to \u00a39.2 trillion; since $4.86 exchanged for \u00a31 those days, this sum equals about $45 trillion  There is first the issue of using export surplus as the measure for appropriation. Before approaching which, I must draw attention to the seemingly arbitrary 5% interest rate, for which we are given no explanation. There is then the use of exchange rates from pre-1938, passed off as $USD in 2016, expressed in terms of it's value in comaprison to the \u00a3 in the same era, while the exchange rates for the two currencies were drastically different in 2016. This is, not reflective of serious thought being applied to this evaluation. To add to that, according to Tomlison, B.R.*The New Cambridge History Of India III, The Economy of Modern India, 1860-1970*, 2003, p. 13-14   > The size of the unrequited transfers, those needed to meet the 'Home Charges' (the administrative and military expenses of the Indian Government in Britain), was small, running at around Rs 20 million a year, less than 2 per cent of total export values at the end of 1913.  [ Source : India's International Economy in the Nineteenth Century: An Historical Survey Author(s): K. N. Chaudhuri, Modern Asian Studies, Vol. 2, No. 1 (1968) ]  Prof Patnaik sheds light as to how she arrives at this conclusion in the article :  > The Secretary of State for India in Council, based in London, invited foreign importers to deposit with him the payment (in gold, sterling and their own currencies) for their net imports from India, and these gold and forex payments disappeared into the yawning maw of the SoS\u2019s account in the Bank of England. Against India\u2019s net foreign earnings he issued bills, termed Council bills (CBs), to an equivalent rupee value.  Description of such bills of exchange as \"appropriation\" by the British government, is highly contentious and doesn't seem to be based in any evidence. The sale of Council Drafts was a convenient tool for the management of Indian currency, exchange, and finance. Usually, India ran a surplus on trade account, yet, payment had to be made in sterling to meet the \u2018Home Charges\u2019. The Secretary of State in Council invited tenders for delivery of sterling in London against payment in rupees from Government funds in India. The Act XVII of the year 1835, declared the silver rupee of 180 grains troy, 11/12ths fine, as the sole legal tender currency of British India. Furthermore, average production of silver rose from 1.34 million kgs. during 1866-70 to 1.97 million kgs. during 1871-75 and further to 2.86 million kgs. during 1881-85, gold output declined from an average of 0.20 million kgs. during 1866-70 to 0.17 million kgs. during 1871-75 and further to 0.15 million kgs. during 1881-85. This severely depreciated the value of the Indian rupee. To add on to the problems of the Government of India, the payments for the \"Home Charges\" of the Government, being interest on debt, pensions, payments to the War Office, cost of Government stores, etc. increased, and these had to be made in sterling. The government flirted with a gold standard, and a committee was setup for the same purpose under Lord Herschel, the Lord Chancellor, in October 1892 by the Secretary of State, yet the growing silver depreciation, explains the necessity for the Council Drafts as a means of exchange.

That's an inch or two taller than major European countries \u2014 the British and Dutch averaged around 5 feet and 5.5 inches; the French were shorter still.   Another study looking solely at American soldiers similarly found the average male soldier in 1864 was just over 5'7\" tall; the average soldier in World War II was 5'8.4\" tall, just over an inch higher.   Studies looking at 19th Century male height almost exclusively look at soldiers, because that was often the only consistent way of collecting data. But these data should be looked at carefully \u2014 because European armies, at least, usually had minimum height requirements for soldiers, and surprisingly large numbers of European conscripts flunked that test.   Looking at France, my specialty, in the 1820s \"about a quarter of boys liable for conscription were refused as being below the minimum height to handle a musket (only just over 5 feet),\" per historian Robert Tombs. The shortest, most malnourished soldiers came not from the teeming large cities but from the poorest rural areas. Eugen Weber gives some specific examples from the department of Lot in southwestern France; in one district, the 1830 draft class consisted of 1,051 draftees, of which 212 (one-fifth) were rejected. Of those, the cited reason was stuntedness (*d\u00e9faut de taille*) for 120. Consistently, Weber notes, up to half of all people rejected for military service were rejected for shortness. (Many of the others had various physical deformities or ailments, which are also associated with malnourishment. \"In 1860 one rural area near Grenoble had this to show to the army recruiters: goiter, 140; deaf or dumb, 13; lame, 13; myopia, 36; tapeworm, 19; scabies, 1; skin maladies, 86; scrofula, 15; epilepsy, 2; general weakness, 197; hunchback, 29; bone distortion, 2. In a total of 1,000, 553 men were disqualified, only 447 found fit for service.\")   Alain Corbin's case study of a 19th Century French peasant (born 1798, died 1876) notes that he was 5'5\" tall and that \"for this time and place, in other words, he was a tall man.\"   One 1849 discussion of \"men remarkable by their height\" to serve in elite French units \"makes clear that they are between 5'6\" and 5'8\" tall,\" Weber writes. These elite, unusually tall French soldiers would have been average or even short in the Union Army!  By 1860, the situation in France had improved somewhat \u2014 Emile Durkheim found \"the number of conscripts rejected for height dropped from 92.8 per 1,000 in 1831 to 59.4 per 1,000 in 1860,\" but that's still more than 1 in 20 men being less than around 5' tall. Today 1 in 297 adult Frenchmen would fail that test. (This reflects improvements in agriculture and transportation during the 1850s.) Even the soldiers who were healthy enough to be admitted into the army often required \"a few months of solid regular feeding, including 340 grams of meat a day, before they could cope with the physical demands of service.\"  Unlike in Europe, the Union Army didn't have codified height minimums, but rather a subjective judgment by an examining doctor. One American officer summarized the situation in 1875:   > Weight is not a regulated quality in any code of laws governing the enlistment of recruits. The circumference of chest thought to be indispensable as an accompaniment to certain degrees of stature, is carefully laid down in the English regulations, but weight is not even mentioned. It is presumed that the matter is left to the discretion of the examining surgeon, with whom the decision as to the other qualities named might, it is thought, be also left with advantage. A due proportion in the weight is quite as essential in the soldier as a well-formed chest, and is of greater importance than lofty stature. In former times, when it was necessary to make use of a ramrod in loading a musket, men of a certain height were absolutely necessary for the service; but in these days of breech-loading arms, a man from 5 feet to 5 feet 4 inches in stature, and well proportioned in build and weight is, ceteris paribus, as serviceable a soldier as can be desired.  Americans were shorter then than they are now, but if you're comparing them to other Western countries, Union soldiers were remarkable not for being short but for being tall.  EDIT: I've seen nearly half a dozen replies now asking questions about my use of inches and feet. To preempt more: Those are standard, modern inches and feet. In most cases the raw height data was given in centimeters and I translated it into modern feet and inches because the question was asked using those units. No, the differences here are not explained by the confusion about different units called the \"foot\" that is commonly cited as a reason for the (largely false) belief in Napoleon's shortness.

                "content": " As outlined in Geoffrey Robertson's book *An Inconvenient Genocide*, the core belief behind the Turkish denial of the Armenian Genocide lies in the *motives* for the killings. Turkish Officials don't deny that Ottoman military personnel killed Armenians; they dispute the amount (they claim 300 000, while the most commonly referred to number is 1.5 million) and the reasoning behind it.  Robertson cites the Turkish \"official\" numbers of Armenians living in Turkey at the time as a reason that 1.5 million Armenians couldn't have been killed: \"[Turkish] demographic studies prove that prior to World War I, fewer than 1.5 million Armenians lived in the entire Ottoman Empire. Thus, allegations that more than 1.5 million Armenians from eastern Anatolia died must be false.\"  (It's noteworthy that Robertson counters this with evidence from the Armenian Church, who claim that 2.1 million Armenians were living in Anatolia at that time.)  On the intention, Article II of the United Nations *Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Genocide* outlines that, in order for a sanctioned killing to be classified as a genocide, there must be \"intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group...\". Turkish officials today claim that the killings were performed because Armenians \"rose up\" against the Ottoman government in support of Russia, hoping that in victory they would claim their independence. To support this, in 2007 Turkish counsellor Orhan Tung wrote in the New Statesman (an opinion that the government mirrors to this day) that \"credible evidence\" for the intention to commit genocide has never been concretely found. This is obviously disputed, because as opposed to the Holocaust or the Bosnian War, there are no reported documents that are widely internationally recognized as showing intent for genocide.  (Again, its worth noting that Armenian historian Ara Sarafian reported to Mediamax that *Talaat Pasha's Report on the Armenian Genocide*, which was published by the Gomidas Institute in April 2011, as a proper Ottoman government document showcasing this exact intent.)  tl;dr: The Turkish government doesn't belief that an Armenian *genocide* happened, but refer to it as politically motivated killings, because of the definition of \"genocide\" by the United Nations."

They believed that the universe was created on a \"mound of creation\" (as it's called by Egyptologists), which rose out of the receding flood waters of the Nile. There are various versions of the creation story, but in the most exciting one Atum or Re-Atum created the first pantheon of deities by masturbating them into existence: \"Atum is the one who came into being as one who came (with penis) extended in Heliopolis. He put his penis in his fist so that he might make orgasm with it, and the two twins were born, Shu and Tefnut.\"^1 This mound of creation is called Benben by Egyptologists (Egyptian \ud80c\udcc0\ud80c\ude16\ud80c\udcc0\ud80c\ude16\ud80c\ude74), and it was a common feature of temples for millennia of Egyptian history, demonstrating the incredible longevity of this idea.^2  Most cultures have a creation myth that puts them at the center, so that doesn't completely answer your question. In Egypt, however, they kept written records of their history, which referenced their understanding of creation. There are frequent allusions to the \"original time\" (\ud80c\udd6e\ud80c\udfcf\ud80c\udfd6) in Egyptian texts, including the Pyramid Texts, and a glimpse of what they understood this to mean is found in the Turin Royal Canon.^3 That document records the reigns of kings from the New Kingdom back to the reigns of well-known Egyptian deities, including Seth, Horus, and Thoth. The tomb of the First Dynasty king Djer (also in the Turin Canon, II.13 in the facsimile) was later venerated as the tomb of the god Osiris.   So not only did they believe that they were the first civilization, created ex nihilo by the gods, they had places where they could go and see those gods' tombs in person. Their official history recorded the descent of their living kings from ancient deities, and they continually referred to these deities in contemporary texts. When they found old things, they knew that those things belonged to their civilization, and that they were directly descended from the people who made them.   Sources:  1. Translation from: Allen, James P. 2015. *The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts*. See the original texts here. This quote is in *PT IV (422-538)*, p. 279.   2. Obviously there is more to be said here. Representations of the mound of creation changed over time, but the central idea was always present. There's a great deal on this in: Kemp, Barry J. 2005. *Ancient Egypt: Anatomy of a Civilization*.   3. The Wikipedia page is actually a great source for this.

                "content": " Great question! I'll refer you to *Emperors of Dreams: Drugs in the Nineteenth Century* by Mike Jay, and I'll mix in a few other sources as we talk about it. David Musto (the god of American narcotics historians) wrote a fascinating 1989 paper entitled \"Why did Sherlock Holmes Use Cocaine?\" that I recommend too.  Before we talk about Arthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes, let's pull back a little bit and talk about late Victorian British society's attitude toward narcotics. Narcotics \u2500 particularly opium and morphine, but also cocaine and other substances \u2500 were a hot-button topic in Victorian Britain and the United States at the time.  As Jay points out, a lot of the discussion on opium portrays it almost as a plague with significant racial undertones, given that most British and American audiences were introduced to opium by Chinese immigrants or a Chinese experience. That's remarkably ironic given the role the British played in spreading opium in China. In Britain, the Anglo-Oriental Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade circulated a journal called *Friend of China* that ostensibly tried to point out all the harm opium had done to China.  In reality, it was a spectacularly racist publication that frequently claimed that the Chinese were piteous children unable to protect themselves against the opium menace, and only Western society could save them. Moreover, the journal warned, the opium menace might spread to Western society, with Biblical allusions to Hosea 8:7 (sowing the wind and reaping the whirlwind).  You see an anti-opium mood spread rapidly into popular culture in the late 1860s and into the 1870s. Dickens' unfinished novel, *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*, for example, features an opium addict and scenes in an opium den. The notion of the opium den as a plague, as something to be feared because it might infect polite society, begins to come to pass at this time. Conan Doyle takes it up, as does Oscar Wilde in *Picture of Dorian Gray.*  Meredith Conti, in a paper published last year in the book *Victorian Medicine and Popular Culture*, wonderfully explains that chronic drug use combined with this infectious, xenophobic viewpoint, and hit popular culture with a splash.  >\"Soon, however, a number of factors gradually reshaped public attitudes toward drug addiction: the return of wounded soldiers addicted to analgesics; physician over-prescription; the surge in opiate-laced patent medicines ... the invention of the hypodermic needle; and the first legislative restrictions on non-medical opiate use.\"  In popular society, there had been a belief during the middle part of the century that addicts had nothing to blame but themselves. It was because of their weak will, or poor morals, or some personal factor that made them vulnerable to opium, alcohol and vice. As Darwin's theories became more popular, the idea came about that there must be a genetic cause \u2500 that addicts have a hereditary inclination toward addiction.    Note that there is at this time a big difference between *addiction* and *use.* This distinction would persist until the early 20th century, by and large. You'll frequently run into references to the idea that high-performing individuals, fast thinkers, big-doers, need to use narcotics to moderate their overheating minds, otherwise they might suffer a breakdown. You see this in *The Sign of Four,* where Conan Doyle writes about Holmes needing to stave off boredom.  Elsewhere, there's often a feminine tone to this language, as the thoughts of the period were that the feminine spirit was fragile and needed to be kept in balance or otherwise preserved from too much emotion.  The idea of a \"naturally corrupt\" class of people prone to addiction starts to change in the late 1870s and early 1880s. In 1876, Edward Levinstein published the influential *Morbid Craving for Morphia*, which described narcotics' *corrupting* influence, about how even proper people could be brought low. In the years after his work, drug addiction became a medical condition in Britain.  At the same time, cocaine begins to come onto the British scene in a big way. In 1885, for example, Doyle's hometown of Southsea hosts the British Dental Association's annual conference. The conference's big topic? The virtues of cocaine anaesthesia. This was also the time when Americans, British citizens and others in Western society were flocking to coca-laced beverages (*Coca-Cola,* anyone?) as the new fad.   In a 1994 paper, \"Sherlock Holmes, Conan Doyle and cocaine,\" D.N. Pearce suggests that Doyle's studies at the University of Edinburgh, where toxicology research was quite advanced for the time, gave him a leg up in anticipating the harmful effects of cocaine.  By the time *The Sign of the Four* is published five years later, with its remarkable references to cocaine addiction, the popular mood had begun to shift in the direction of cocaine as a vice rather than a pure medicine. The Sherlock Holmes stories aren't the only place you see this discussion come up. Think of *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, published in 1886, and other stories, such as those by Bloomsbury and M.P. Shiel.  Jay suggests that Conan Doyle intended Holmes' cocaine habit to be part of his bohemian, counterculture identity, but as popular opinion began viewing cocaine as purely a vice, references fade to holmes' use. By 1904, when *The Missing Three-Quarter* is published, Conan Doyle writes that his hero has been \"weaned\" from his \"drug mania\" which had \"threatened to check his remarkable career,\" something that's clearly a ret-con to accommodate changing times.  As Musto wrote in his 1989 paper, \"Therefore, Holmes's use of cocaine was not reprehensible. Leading physicians much more prominent than the wise Dr. Watson recommended cocaine for the reasons Holmes used it. That he used cocaine was unfortunate, but he corrected the error \u2500 and that was commendable.\""

                "content": " OP is inspired by Pocahontas, and much of this thread is about California, so I will try to pivot it back to Virginia (where Pocahontas was from).   When the English colonized Jamestown in 1607, they saw \"great smokes of fire\" which were caused by the Indians burning grasslands and swamps. (George Percy).  This is consistent with first hand accounts for the next 100 years, which consistently show large open grasslands in Virginia and the Carolinas.  Anyone familiar with that area will know that, if left to a natural course, cleared land in most of the mid-Atlantic/Appalachian states will quickly become impenetrably thick brush, and then succeed into forest.    Each Indian village in Virginia would have had between a few acres of cleared land, up to hundreds of acres of cleared land, to support corn, beans, and squash. (Archer, 1607, Smith, 1624, Roundtree, 1989). These trees were probably felled by slash and burn techniques, girdling, felling, and other fire techniques.  Once the soil was depleted (fertilizer was not used), the local hunting stocks depleted, etc., then the slash & burn fields area would be expanded by clearing new fields, until the settlement was too large to efficiently live on.  The local forest was felled for firewood, new farming plots, and building materials until the woods were too far away for convenient use, at which point the tribe would relocate.  They might return to that site several decades later.  For example, at Seneca Rocks at the headwaters of the Potomac River (around the WV/Va border), there is evidence of a farming village that lasted for 20 yeas, was abandoned for 200 years, and then re-settled on the same site and then abandoned again within about 15-20 years of use (Brinker, 1998).    This continual slash & burn (and then move) pattern left a patchwork of successional forestland.  A single village might be \"actively\" using 50 acres of land, but multiple hundred acres of surrounding land on widely scattered tracks would show a disturbance pattern; which also impacted game populations.  For example, in Virginia, overhunting of whitetail deer caused the Powhatans to organize expeditions for hunting deer into the interior of the state and into grounds claimed by the Monacans, leading to bloody turf wars.  (Strachey 1612, Roundtree 1989). Strachey also explained in 1612 (and Smith in 1624) how the Indians used fire to hunt; basically setting fires to drive game toward nets or pre-positioned hunters.  [aside - using fire to drive large game to their peril is a technique probably used by prehistoric/proto-indigenous man (box canyons and cliff jumps) and similar to modern day deer drives which are still used by hunters in some parts of Virginia, the Carolinas, and the Great Lakes region (who have replaced fire breaks and lines with hounds or skirmish lines of men)]  The actual landscape of much of Virginia and the Carolinas was visibly and physically different when encountered by the English.  Much of it was described as barrens or savannah with widespread grasslands.  Samuel Argall in 1613 spotted bison after marching into northern Virginia (near Washington DC) and bison were known to live in central North Carolina until the early-mid 1700s.  John Lederer in 1672 mapped a savannah through western Virginia's piedmont region, and Robert Beverly in 1705 also described areas of large meadows and savannas of several hundred acres without a single tree, but instead grass and reeds of great height.  In 1733, William Byrd described the area around the Dan River as \"bare of timber\" but found scattered bison. John Fontaine in 1716 found grasslands in the Shenandoah Valley, populated by elk and bison.  No less than a young George Washington, working as a surveyor in 1752 (after Indians were no longer in the Shenandoah Valley) found many \"barrens\" with burnt stumps and patches of hardwood saplings.  This is ***not*** a natural landscape for Virginia and North Carolina, but one that was consistently burned by humans to create an open, prairie situation.    Returning to the OP and Pocahontas, Henry Spelman in 1613 wrote that the \"the country is full of wood in some parts\" which implies that it was open and without forest in others. He wrote that the Powhatans had open small fields where ***\"their\"*** deer, goats, and stags feedeth.\" These fields would have been maintained with fire.   Finally, first hand accounts indicate that the forests themselves were modified by fire.  Robert Beverly in 1705 reported that the trees did not have any lower branches until 70 feet above ground. Smith in 1624, Strachey in 1612, and others reported that the forests floor was clean and passable by horse and on foot, and that the woods near the Potomac River had trees spread so far apart that a carriage and four horse could travel through the woods (Andrew White, 1634).  The Spotswood Expedition rode  horses up river to the Blue Ridge and were able to see long-range vistas while still in the forest (Fontaine, 1716).  You cannot ride a horse through most areas of the Eastern woodlands today, without constantly dodging low branches, and the density of trees (in basically all of Appalachia) prevents sweeping vistas.    You get the idea.  The Indians in Virginia and the Carolinas were absolutely clearcutting forests and using a lot of fire management to maintain large prairie conditions (such that elk and bison lived there).  When the soil was depleted, they would move to new areas and continue these practices.  This was mostly sustainable for thousands of years, because of the much lower population density.  But it did not mean that they were complete preservationists in harmony with nature.  Whether measured by first hand observations or the scientific/archeological record, they were engaged in a cycle of using-depleting-moving across the landscape, and using fire to shape the ecosystem.

As I discussed in response to Each decade of the 20th century is pretty easily distinguishable from one another in terms of fashion, cultural product, technology, and even social outlook. Were the decades of the 18th and 19th centuries equally as varied and self-contained?, however, the decade is a social construct, and nothing actually changes by that span of time, so it's unsurprising that the phenomenon didn't exist earlier - and the fact that it didn't doesn't mean that earlier decades were actually indistinguishable. Fashion historians like myself can date portraits/illustrations by the clothing and hairstyles in them going back to roughly the \"tailoring revolution\" of the fourteenth century, when people began to show status with clothing that was cut and constructed in new and fashionable ways, rather than by simply using more expensive fabrics and ornamentation.  I also have an answer to Nowadays, people often wear clothing and styles from past decades. Was this common in the past? (Eg. In the 1920s, were there people wearing 19th century clothing?) which discusses the fact that people didn't really want to wear old-fashioned clothing in everyday life, even as fashion routinely repeated historical forms."

Although /u/KyleBridge refers to another thread covering the same question(s), that one focuses (among other things) on the paper industry. My own paper is more concerned about the overall chronology of the \"Drug War\", as well as its moral background.   First of all it's necessary to remark that the Congress didn't prohibit cannabis per se in 1937. Rather, it delegated the responsibility for the *taxation* of cannabis in 1937, to the IRS.    *\"it [Marihuana Tax Act red.] technically did not make marijuana illegal; it simply placed a huge bureaucratic burden \u2013 with severe penalties for noncompliance \u2013 on anyone who wanted to sell or buy the drug.\"* -Reznicek,2012.     The literature concerning this topic attribute this factor to two aspects of the \"Drug War\". Firstly, by making the taxation and regulation vis a vis cannabis a question about revenue collection, the actors who supported prohibition and/or regulation of cannabis, were able to omit a discussion about state rights contra federal rights. By making the regulation a federal \"sized\" matter, they increased the scope of their agenda.     *\"By basing their efforts on the federal government\u2019s constitutionally assigned revenue-collecting powers \u2013 that is, on the power of taxation \u2013 and on the regulation of interstate trade, proponents of antinarcotic legislation avoided the questions of individual states\u2019 rights that were broached by any attempt at the direct control of drug sales and use.\"* -Hickman 2007.  Secondly, prohibitionists felt that a taxation came across as a more \"neutral\" initiative, and in this regard \"sold\" the idea to the congress.    Your question also implies the alcohol prohibition (18th Amendment) which ended four years earlier. This exact prohibition left several without a job in 1933 when (alcohol)prohibition ended,when that the substance they had sought to combat, once again became legal. In comes Harry Anslinger, who was also occupied with the alcohol prohibition earlier. -Bertram, 1996.     Anslinger managed to \"spin\" the regulation of cannabis in a way, that it was mostly connected to minorities, primarily Mexican immigrants. The immigrants became \"persona(s) non grata\" since the Depression made them unwanted competitors;    *\u201dThe consumption of marijuana, or cannabis, in the United States followed an influx of Mexican immigrants in the early twentieth century who were fleeing their country\u2019s civil war. During the Great Depression, massive unemployment increased public resentment and fear of Mexican immigrants, escalating concerns about the problem of drugs.\"* -Reznicek, 2012.    It is also worth noting, that the \"Marihuana Tax Act\" 1937 was but one of the many chapters in the \"Drug War\" or \"War on Drugs\". From a legislative point of view, it expanded on an earlier act known as the \"Harrison Narcotics Tax Act\" from 1914. The Harrison law (named after a New York Senator) also taxed certain drugs. However, it was only concerned with heroin, cocaine, and opium.     Hence the 1937 act addressed this by including cannabis as another substance to be taxed and regulated. This regulation did not mean a *de jure* criminalization, rather a *de facto* since it was not worth paying the taxes and deal with the ensuing bureaucracy.     This is just a brief answer to your question, but I hope you made something out of it. If not, please let me know, and I'll go more into detail with various factors, particularly the ethnic and racial background for some of the regulation/taxation of the various laws.

There are a never ending parade of new books come out that have U-Boat in the title. Some include:  * *Hitler\u2019s U-Boat War: The Hunters, 1939-1942*, * *America\u2019s U-Boats: Terror Trophies of World War I*,  * *The Merchant U-Boat: Adventures of the Deutschland, 1916-1918*, * *Hitler\u2019s \u201cWonder\u201d U-Boats: The Birth of the Cold War\u2019s Hunter Killer Submarines*  It is safe to say this is a very truncated list of \"U-Boat\" books but are some examples of the way that it gets used today: to refer exclusively to German submarines. Now, it is a term I try to avoid in my writing - even when discussing German submarines. The first reason for this is that there exists a direct English translation for *unterseeboot*: submarine. It is a word whose meaning is fully captured by a direct translation. Secondly, it is a *half translation* of the German. The short german version of *Unterseeboot* is *U-Boot*, not \"U-Boat\".   I also wish to avoid the romanticization and mystification that comes from utilizing German terminology. The term \u201cu-boat\u201d adds a layer of mystery to German submarines that did not exist during the First World War and through using the term, usage of the submarine gets tied almost entirely to Germany. In equating submarines with Germany, authors can give a false impression about the scope of submarine operations to the war, while also giving a romantic edge to a policy which resulted in the deliberate deaths of civilians. It gets used as a term of romanticization, that makes German submarines into an \"other\", even though many other countries were using their submarines in the same or similar ways during both World Wars. The Germans **DID NOT** have a monopoly on submarines or submarine operations. Why use a term which invites a romantizied and simple interpretation?  The term additionally invokes images of Nazi Germany and its submarine campaigns during the Second World War. There was nothing particularly special about German submarines during the First World War that necessitates identifying them by a German word. Authors do not refer to French submarines as \u201csous-marins\u201d in their writing, thus the same standard should be applied to the Germans. What set German submarines apart was how they were utilized, but this was not inherent to the submarine itself and that can be appropriately expressed without utilizing the term \u201cU-Boat.\u201d  I would go as far to say that the same applies to German submarines of the Second World War. The linked answer from u/Georgy_K_Zhukov best frames these sorts of reasons for avoiding the term.  OK so, with the reasons why *I* try to avoid \"U-Boat\" in my writing, lets dig into some of its history.  \"U-Boat\" starts to appear in English publications as shorthand for \"Submarine\" in late 1915. The beginning of the war saw positive comments in the American press about British, French, and German submarines - but these articles always used the word \"sub\" or \"submarine\" with the nation acting as an adjective. It's not until months after the *Lusitania* was sunk on May 7th, 1915 that \"U-Boat\" starts to appear.  This may seem like a logical point for the \"otherizing\" nature of \"U-Boat\" to have begun - but it's actually not! At this point, the phrase was being used in lieu of \"Sub\" or \"Submarine\" in headlines and photo captions. \"U-Boat\" was being used as a direct substitute for those words in newspapers to *save space* in areas where that was a key concern. This interpretation is borne out by the fact that the phrase \"U-Boat\" was utilized in headlines and captions to describe **ANY** submarine, not just German ones. There were articles about American submarines called \"Uncle Sam's U-Boats\" (referring to submarines built and operated by the US, not the captured ones discussed in that book I mentioned above) and \"British U-Boats\" and \"French U-Boats\". In the text of these articles, the term \"U-Boat\" wasn't used instead they said \"German subs\" or \"American submarines\". So in essence the phrase first took hold as a way of saving space in headlines and captions in newspapers during the First World War, and it's clear that there was at least some understanding that the Allies *also* were using Submarines in various ways.  Even the American war history for Submarine Division 5, whose sole purpose in Ireland was to hunt for German submarines, does not use the term. They use \"the enemy\", \"hun\", \"Germans\", \"submarine\" - but not \"U-Boat\". And they were fighting them!  What set the Germans apart in the First World War was mostly their usage. Not in specifically waging an anti-shipping campaign (as the British and Russians conducted one in the Baltic Sea, and the British and French in the Sea of Marmara) but in an \"unrestricted\" campaign where merchant vessels (initially belligerent in 1915, but eventually also neutral in 1917) were liable to be sunk without warning - their crew and passengers not allowed to get to safety. The *overall* usage of German submarines was often similar to the Allies, and their boats were roughly the same. Yes, there were some differences in endurance, class types, and specific pieces of technology (the Allies usually bemoaned their periscopes compared to the German ones, for example)  - but these were not huge gulfs in submarine technology (especially since the British developed and deployed some of the most sophisicated submarines of the war). German submarines were pretty similar to their Allied counterparts, and this is reflected in the phrase \"U-Boat\" being applied to all nations.  This practice did not end with the start of the Second World War in Europe. There were newspapers applying \"U-Boat\" to British and French submarines up through 1941. So not even the unrestricted campaign up to that point of the Second World War was enough to entirely associate \"U-Boat\" with Germany. It's not seen after 1942, leading me to suspect that US entry into the Second World War was a decisive factor in needing to \"otherize\" German submarines.  That is in more popular parlance. The term may have gained hold among those in the Naval service when talking about a specific **class** of German submarines. A piece of evidence for this is a lecture given Captain T.C. Hart in 1920. He had been an officer in the US Submarine force during the First World War. In his lecture, he does refer to \"U-Boats\", but when he does he is referring specifically to the \"*U*\" Class. He differentiates them from the \"*UB*\" and \"*UC*\" classes. This is an area which requires a bit more investigation.  So in essence, no it's my opinion that we should not be using the term \"u-boat\". They're just submarines, and we're doing readers a historical disservice to treat German submarines as a mysterious \"other\", when they were so very similar to their Allied counterparts and to how the term was historically used.  Also tagging /u/tough_guys_wear_pink as you might find this interesting."

                "content": " This is a tricky one to answer, but I'm going to take a stab at it. As individual cases of small mom and pop shops seeing an increase in sales are extremely difficult to come by, I will be focusing on the major players.  By \"major players\" in the pizza industry, a few in particular come to mind - Pizza Hut, Domino's, and Papa John's.   **Papa John's** - founded in 1984 - doesn't go public until 1993, the latter half of the time period in your question. At the time of the initial public offering (being June 9th of that year), Papa John's own stock page suggests that the company was $2.25/share. I've seen secondhand accounts that it opened at $13 at share, but I couldn't find anything from 1993 to back this up; nonetheless, by the end of the original Turtles series (being November 2nd, 1996) the stock sold at triple that - the price on November 1st being $8.29 a share.   Is this because of the Ninja Turtles? Hard to say, but I'm going to go with unlikely. Most sources I found on the rise of Papa John's suggest that the main factors going into the company's rise were quality ingredients, acting like an independent pizza shop despite being a chain while keeping consistency, and the cheap price to franchise (often less than $100,000).   **Domino's Pizza** - founded in 1960 - does not go public until 2004, and I had no luck finding any financial information for the time period questioned. However, company sales were certainly up in the 1990s - an article from the Los Angeles Times states:  > *Closely held Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Domino's, which was advised in the transaction by J.P. Morgan Securities, had 1997 sales of $3.2 billion, up from $2.8 billion in 1996. The agreement signed Friday was expected to be completed within a few months.*  which implies that sales were certainly good. Was *this* increase in revenue caused by the Ninja Turtles? Once again, probably not. The chain had seen a massive expansion - by 1983, the company had opened a thousand stores and expanded out of the country by 1993 into international branches. The Ninja Turtles could have helped in theory - the chain cameos in the first Ninja Turtles film - but the chain was already experiencing major growth, turtles or not.  **Pizza Hut** - founded in 1958 - had already been bought by PepsiCo in 1977, but I couldn't find stock prices from that specific year. On the day of the debut of the TMNT cartoon, however - December 14th, 1987 - PepsiCo stock was $5.35 a share; by the end of the series, it was more than five times that - closing out at an even $30 a share. Of course, this is PepsiCo as a whole - that stock price was accounting for earnings from the soda industry, the pizza industry, the snack industry, the introduction of Pepsi plants and Pizza Huts in the opening Soviet Union, etc. Even so, I will argue that Pizza Hut - and therefore PepsiCo - was somewhat aided by the Ninja Turtles.   After the success of the first Ninja Turtles movie, the characters went on a live show tour. Who funded it? Pizza Hut. As an article from the *Chicago Tribune* states:  > *Pizza Hut has pumped more than $20 million into the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle album it is offering in its restaurants-more than 2 million already have been sold-along with its 40-city live rock concert/theatrical production, ''Coming Out of Their Shells,'' which will be at the Arie Crown Theatre for 10 performances Tuesday through next Sunday.*  And this was on top of a marketing campaign between the two parties; unlike with earlier cameos in *Back to the Future*, however, Pizza Hut doesn't appear in any of the 90s Turtles movies. This doesn't deter them, however, as they appear in the Ninja Turtles II arcade game and, as shown in the first commercial I linked, gave coupons with the VHS release of the film. On top of that (and it has been a lot), the soundtrack was given away with every pan pizza ordered at the chain.   As MTV noted in their coverage of the brand alliance:   > *\"Over 2 million cassette tapes of the show\u2019s soundtrack were sold that year with the purchase of a personal pan pizza at Pizza Hut. The official Turtles Tour video made no attempt to hide that Pizza Hut was the real captain behind the wheel. Even Senior Vice President of Marketing for Pizza Hut, David Novack, appeared midway through to deliver a press statement on Pizza Hut's behalf: 'We're just absolutely thrilled to get the world's most famous pizza eaters to hook up with the number one pizza company in the world. Pizza Hut will launch the most aggressive promotion ever done in the record industry to support the Turtles' new music, which I'm sure all of America will love.'\"*  In conclusion, while I wouldn't call it a major player in the pizza industry beyond their connections to one of the largest chains, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles during their commercial peak certainly left their mark on the pizza industry."

As some other posts point out, the most financially strapped presidents tended to be 19th century, with a few 20th century examples. However some early presidents dealt with sizable debt (and moreso in today's terms cash flow). Washington had to borrow money to be able to travel to his own inaguration. Monroe owed thousands when he left office and ultimately moved in with his daughter (but did pay it mostly off previous to that). Madison neglected Montpelier and lost quite a bit towards the end. Even JQ Adams had to sell property to clear the debts of his father. The winner of early American indebtedness and wealth spent presidents, however, is Mr Thomas Jefferson. It's estimated he was worth 212M$ at peak, about half of Washington and twice Madison, and died a little above even, assets to debts. But to see why we really need to look at a larger picture, so let's talk some Jefferson.  For the most part, he carried a \"typical\" Virginia farmers debt until 1773 when his father in law, John Wayles, died and quadrupled what TJ was on the hook for. Debt was very common in the 1770s and particularly for tobacco farmers. Debates over repayment of English held debt actually were part of the 1783 treaty and factored in the 1794 Jay Treaty, with final resolution coming in 1802. In the same month (May) back in 1773, his best friend from childhood and brother in law, Dabny Carr, also died, leaving Jefferson to care for his sister and her children as well. From then on, his home in Charlottesvile was crowded even when he was away - which he was away a lot. He spent a big chunk of the 1770s in Williamsburg and Philly, then became governor of Virginia. He retired after that, but soon Martha would die, shattering his everything. He took an appointment and spent five more years away, this time in France, spending massive piles of money all the while.   He stopped recording a ledger of finances in the 70s, but continued recording purchases as if to somehow remain in control of his balance sheet. His farm never performed how he planned and he was rarely there to oversee day to day operations, further limiting his returns on crops and goods. Returning from France, he continued to spend. Upon arriving in town to serve under Washington, he had a case of wine delivered for the new president, and a second for himself. He then bought a toothbrush, and a new painting. His book collection was worth a small fortune by this point, and he was always willing to sign bonds for his friends. His eldest daughter married a man of poor reputation, by some accounts a wife beater and by all accounts an alcoholic. For most of her adult life, he would care for her.  It got worse after he became VP and even moreso as President. 40 years had been spent in public service, and he was broke. Soon the needle went from green(ish) to red and he was truly indebted. Post presidency, he never slowed down. His house was crowded with family and visitors daily, yet all were fed and housed which took a demanding toll on the crop yield, one report saying the mountaintop farm barely grew enough to feed the mountaintop guests. Still, he didn't slow down entertaining or spending. Ironically, he eliminated 30M$ in American debt - about a third of what we owed - while his personal assets continued to spiral. In 1809 he finally finished comstruction on Monticello; the mountain top was levelled in the late 1760s and construction started in 1769, some 40 years earlier. It had been built, then rebuilt. And it had cost a fortune.  The Library of Congress had been burned by the British, so he sold his personal library to America for a fraction of what he had paid; over 6,000 books were bought for a little under 24,000$ - still, it would not clear his debt (and in true style he immediately began purchasing more books - he couldnt live without them, ya know). For the numbers, that's about 4$/book, which 1\u00a3 in 1800 equaled about 4.40$, so he recieved about a pound/book - when the average price was at least several pounds each. He was by now an absolute master of creative financing.  A few years later, in 1817, about a decade after leaving office, a friend asked him to sign a bond for 20,000$, so he did. The farmer defaulted and soon Jefferson was paying over 1200$/month just on that one loan. The farmer also happened to be the father of his grandson's wife, who was mortified when she learned of it. Jefferson never said anything to her about it, and upon seeing her for the first time since the occurance did not give his typical greeting, instead embracing her with open arms and a great big hug. While money was important, it wasn't *so* important that you'd put it above family. Not to Jefferson, anyway.  1819 caused more trouble and soon he was really massively in debt. He devised a plan - Monticello would be sold in a lottery. It was valued at about 70,000$ (1.5M today), and everything was taking shape. Then a private group of citizens in NY offered to raise the money for him, so the lottery went on pause. They raised about 16,000$ - a small portion of what he owed. By the time they relaunched the lottery campaign, the excitement had partly slipped away. One of his last acts was paying customs duties for a shipment of wine he would never live to drink. With the 50th anniversary of the Dec of Ind came Jefferson's death, on July 4th, 1826. People suddenly didn't care about bailing out his kids as much as they did him, so while he died thinking the lottery would work, it did not. Shortly after an auction was held to absolve his debts, selling his lands, mountaintop home, furniture, kitchen wares, books, paintings, and about 130 people. The family kept his entire private suite of furniture, along with some other personal mementos - the rest was carried off his mountain one by one in the arms of new owners. It would raise enough that his grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph - the son of the alcoholic - could clear his debts. At death, they were the highest they had ever been in his life: 107,000$ in debt. In today's money, it would be about ~~1.5M$~~ 2M$. About 50 years after his death the final payment on his last account was made. In 1826, just before his death, he wrote;  >(T)he wonder \u2026 is that I should have been so long as 60. years in arriving at the ultimate & unavoidable result.  He meant selling his home. The place he put his heart into. The place he so loved he went for solo horse rides around it in his 80s. The place he had wandered the woods looking for peace after Martha's death. And the place he and Dabny came as boys and made a pact. The first to die would be burried by the other under the oak which they sat under to read; it is now the cemetery at Monticello, and he knew it must besold.  The public didn't really care. Even with his personal disaster, he was a fiscally sound president. He had heralded a new era for many Americans (and nearly caused new England to secede because of it), and as long as he was a good president and didn't default, he could spend his eyes out. Some were fearful he would be re-elected again and again, becoming a life president, and they threw everything they could find at him. While that didn't really happen, he did serve two terms, followed by his ideological brother, Madison, serving two of his own. Then came another Jeffersonian, Monroe, with his two terms, J.Q. Adams snuck in for a term in 1824 but was quickly followed by two terms of Jackson, who we could call a quasi-jeffersonian. It isn't a hard picture to paint that, despite being in debt from his mid 20s until his death in his 80s, he was popular enough usher in the *Virginia Dynasty* of presidents.  While certainly not the only president in debt or  borrowing to sustain a lifestyle, he makes the list of notable occurances. A really important part of this is just how different their world was. For instance, all of this credit was issued to white men with property, always, and it wasn't as a direct mortgage, either. Apply this fact to today: back then, mortgaging your property meant losing your ability to vote.  E: typo and flow  2nd E: correction of sleepy brain"

                "content": " The scope of this question runs from 1866 with the defeat of the Austrians in the Austro-Prussian war of the same year through to the split of Germany in 1945 after Hitler's defeat.  As a side note before I begin, the 'little' German nations, such as Hanover, Saxony, and Bavaria were not inconsiderable nations in their own rights. That Prussia, through the will of Bismark, was able to unify them under one flag was due in part to a nationalist zeal ignited in the post-Napoleonic period, and also in part to the declining influence of Austria/Austria-Hungary in the corresponding period. There was a desire by the rulers of the smaller constituent parts of the Germanies to avoid outright conquest by Prussia, as well as a desire to enact social reforms without a revolutionary bloodbath that had swept up France in 1792. The 1830 and 1848 revolutions stoked German liberalism and nationalism, and it took all of Bismark's political acumen to convince the disparate German nation states that the Prussian constitution and military might were worth binding under, vis-a-vie Austrian hegemony (which is why the Prussians fought the Austrian-Prussian war).    Prussian desire for hegemony arose after the 1815 Vienna settlement in part because Prussia feared Austrian, French, and Russian encirclement. The treaty had two outcomes that would shape the rest of 19th century German history: 1) The establishment of the German Confederation, made up of 39 independent states, and 2) the treaty had ceded territory on the Rhine to Prussia. This had put Prussia under considerable internal strain, as geographically, culturally, and politically the west of the new nation was far removed from the Berlin Prussian monarchy. Napoleon's sparking of nascent German nationalism during his conquest of the Rhineland was fanned by the liberalisation of Europe during the period 1820-1848, which the Austrians under Metternich attempted to suppress. Prussia was kept in check by Austrian military and political supremacy  during this period, but as Austria lost political prestige Prussia began to reassert herself, especially when Otto von Bismark became Prussian Chancellor in 1862. Prussia, with the suport and aid of Austria, fought the 1864 Second Schleswig war against Denmark, which gave them control Schleswig-Holstein. Prussia then went to war with the German Confederation, led by Austria, in 1866, with led to the defeat of the Confederation and then to it dissolving as a political entity. in 1867 the Prussians unified the northern german states into the North German Confederation, which had a federal constitution with Prussian monarch as the head of state.  The German empire was formally declared at the Palace of Versailles on 18th January 1871, at which point the independent principalities and kingdoms of the North German Confederation, led by Prussia, merged with the south German kingdoms and principalities. At this point the various independent entities that had formally been part of the Germanies became states within the new German Reich, with their own laws, customs, and state legislatures. Central authority in the empire rested with the Emperor and the Reichtag, though the democracy that Bismark, the Prussian prime minister, envisaged was of a limited form, with ultimate power resting in the hands of the German Kaiser, who was also the King of Prussia.  Initially the 27 constituent states that formed the newly unified Germany were left to manage their own internal affairs without too much interference from Berlin, as Bismark did not wish to empower the Reichtag with too much power. Over the course of the period between 1871 and 1900 the German state centralised federal control in the hands of the civil service through the State Secretaries, with the effect that even though there was near-universal suffrage in Germany for most adult males, the power of their elected representatives was muted when compared to the bureaucrats who controlled the affairs of state at the behest of the Kaiser.  The effect for the 27 state rulers was that their pre-1871 powers were constrained by the 1871 German constitution. All states sent deputies to the the upper house called the Bundesrat, and although all states were nominally equal in the eyes of the law, as Prussia was the largest state in terms of both population and size they had 17 of the 58 seats, which meant they had little difficulty in obtaining the majority they needed to pass favourable legislation.  One key area the 27 states maintained their own control was the armed forces, so that the larger states, such as Prussia and Saxony, had their own armies, which in turn was modelled on the Prussian army. This had the consequence that during WW1 many regiments were led, or had a titular head, by members of the royal families from the various states.  In terms of the pre-1871 monarchs, Saxony's monarch Fredrick Augustus III abdicated in 1918, turning Saxony into a free state in the Wiemar republic; the same happened with Bavaria, and by the declaration of the armistice on 11th November 1918 all the monarchs who remained in power after 1871 had been removed from power in favour of republican ideals. The reasons for the loss of power are varied, ranging from a general disdain for support of Prussian policies during WWI (in the case of Bavaria and Saxony), to a ground-swell of desire to reform the country after the catastrophic defeat caused by the allies. The monarchical principals of power were discredited in the eyes of the German public by the actions of the ruling elite during the war, even to the point where the Bavarian's sought a separate peace with the allies.  Dues to this, many royal titles were abrogated in 1918, with all temporal power being transferred into the hands the people. The Wiemar government did not removed smaller titles, though, and those landowners, including the Prussian Junker class, were still classed as nobility through the Wiemar and Nazi governments. The fall of Germany in 1945 resulted in a complete overhauling of the governance of Germany in the East and West, with the nobility loosing all their privileges in the process. It is also worth remembering that many of the Prussian noble houses were absorbed into present day Poland and the Baltic states, were their estates were seized by the Communists and turned over to state control.  So, in summation to your question: Most of the German monarchs, Dukes, and princelings of the pre-1871 era were allowed to remain as heads of state of their respective German state (much like a US governor). Due to the actions of the various monarchies during WW1 when the German Republic was declared in 1918 the states transitioned from monarchies and hereditary rulers to directly elected state legislatures, and the former monarchs either went into exile or were settled into civilian life.

Recently, while entertaining friends, it was revealed that my courtship with my husband was less than orthodox. My friends now think that I'm an asshole for the way that I wooed him.  When I was sixteen, my first husband (Adam) was killed while on Crusade. This news was relayed to me by one of Adam's comrades-at-arms (Robert, 29M) who arrived in Carrick bearing Adam's heart for burial in the family chapel. Although I had been fond of Adam (he was the father of my eldest daughter, after all), and was grieved at the news of his death, I was immediately struck by Robert's appearance and manners. I was, in fact, infatuated: not only was Robert handsome and charming, but as a cousin of the king, he was well-positioned at court and within the realm.  I extended Robert an invitation to stay with me for several days so that he could rest after his journey from the Holy Land and he accepted my hospitality. As I really wanted him to stay with me forever, I instructed my household guard to ensure that Robert was confined to the boundaries of my estate. He was given freedom of the castle and its grounds, though, and I made every effort to be a charming, gracious, and attractive hostess.  After several weeks of chaste companionship, I worked up the courage to propose marriage; either Robert could marry me and become lord of my estate, or, he could remain as my guest indefinitely. He chose to marry me and our first daughter was born nine months after the wedding. In the last fifteen years, we have had eleven children and have enjoyed a largely happy union.  Still, our marriage did cause Robert's cousin, King Alexander III, some consternation. As countess of Carrick in my own right, I was considered an heiress of some importance within the kingdom, a ward of the crown's, and technically, I needed the king's approval to marry again. Yet, as I had married his own cousin, Alexander III could not really object to the match; that said, he fined us heavily before agreeing to allow my new husband the use of my title. By virtue of our marriage, Robert has therefore become the earl of Carrick in addition to the lord of Annandale. He is the administrator of my estate in Carrick, and of my fortune. I am happily the wife of a man that I chose and the mother of many beloved children.   All's well that ends well, right? So, am I really an asshole?\n\nAssistant:"

There were some differences in the antebellum South, but little that impacts this specific question because as you'll see if you read the full text it tl;dr, I very strongly suspect the subject is apocryphal* (edit). White plantation ladies hosted parties, entertained their peers, lessers, and leaders, and maintained appearances at all cost.  I have several books and magazines from the era that go into excruciating detail on what to do and not do at parties and I can find no mention of this whatsoever. I've checked my etiquette books from that era and after (here are two examples of later era books I checked, because often etiquette books will recommend *stopping* a practice like that if it's been going on, but no dice), plus a plethora of magazines for anecdotes, stories, etc. I have several years' worth of Harper's and Chautauqua Society magazines, which have lots of slice-of-life articles and social commentary. Nothing.  I *suspect* this is apocryphal for a few reasons. One, etiquette of the period was more rigid, yes, but more importantly ladies were expected to be social and maintain a level of decorum. For a tiny taste of what I mean, here's a sample from one of my etiquette books covering general etiquette. (Sorry about the terrible quality.) Everything was about making others feel at ease, and indeed, that's the theme in every single book and article of the time. Don't be selfish. There's a famous (and possibly apocryphal) story from the era of a society lady who was choking at a dinner party and, rather than embarrass her host, went into the toilet and quietly died. Very Victorian. Mass lady naps during a party just sounds selfish and anti-Victorian. What if a guest wasn't tired? Shall the hostess sleep while her guest stares at the wallpaper? That's a horrifying concept in 1860.  Point two, why? It wasn't the corsets, I can promise you that, especially pre-1880. White women of any means weren't binding themselves into oblivion that early. The corset was a supportive foundation garment and when properly fitted was not uncomfortable or restrictive at all. And keep in mind that they'd been wearing them their entire lives so they were quite used to it. Corsetry had been an established industry for at least a century and even a woman of modest means could afford a decent one; a well-off socialite could choose from the best silk and spiral steel numbers on offer. Even when they did get a bit silly and wasp-waisted in the height of the bustle-era, regular ladies weren't torturing themselves en masse. Well, no more than people do with plastic surgery and extreme body modification today. Those were the elite, the Kardashians. People like me could breathe fine. Speaking of me, here's how I know this: this is me in a reproduction 1880s French seam corset that I made using authentic period techniques. I've been making and wearing them for 20+ years. It's very comfortable, I can breathe fine, touch my toes, and everything. It's boned with steel. Here's a new one I'm working on. I've been researching and speaking on this topic for decades, but there's also a well-researched How Stuff Works article that's worth a read if you're interested.  That said, is it possible that, in the sweltering heat of the Deep South, some groups of friends or some families may have done this as a habit? Sure. Maybe Margaret Mitchell's own family had this tradition and she extrapolated it to everyone. I just personally doubt it was an institution throughout the southern states. If it were, I'm shocked I can't find a single mention of it outside one work of historical fiction. Edit: I also perused online articles and Google Books.  Is absence of evidence evidence of absence? Maybe not, but I've got about a thousand sentences telling women not to hum in public and far more on the various uses of vibrators to cure hysteria (and they weren't supposed to talk about that). I've also got actual Victorian pornography, which isn't supposed to exist. But I can't find this.  Tl;dr: I've been pretty immersed in this era for a long time and I've never seen a single mention of this outside one work of historical fiction, plus I can't think of a supporting reason for it to be true.

                "content": " The body of your post contains a few mischaracterizations of Lincoln and the Republicans that I'll address, and I think you being a bit more specific on your Moderate voter's opinions on slavery would be helpful, but this answer should still hopefully satisfy the base of your question.  First let's address some misconceptions you pose as reasons why a moderate northerner would be hesitant to vote for Lincoln, mainly his inexperience and the \"upstart\" nature of the Republican party. It's worth noting that by 1860 Lincoln had already been active in politics for two decades as both a state legislator and later a member of the House of Reps, in addition to being a highly accomplished lawyer. The Lincoln-Douglas debates propelled him to further fame and notoriety and made him one of the leading voices in the Republican party, meaning that by the time of the election he was no stranger to politics and had been an established frontrunner for the Republican nomination for at least a year. Given that the prior non-Democratic candidates for President since the 1840's were primarily just prominent war heroes and generals (excluding Henry Clay) Lincoln actually was quite politically experienced for the time.   Next, while the \"upstart\" Republican party was relatively new in 1860, it was also the largest and best-established party in opposition to the Democrats. It had already won many Northern states in the 1856 election and controlled the House of Representatives since 1858, so it's not like you would be voting for some insurgent third party in 1860. For most Northerners it was highly likely that your current governor, if not state legislator, was already a Republican by the time 1860 rolled around.  Ok, now that I've established why a moderate Northerner would not have been voting for \"an inexperienced candidate of an upstart party,\" I'll go into the choices for President for a northern voter in 1860. There was Stephen Douglas, the northern Democrat who would in many ways be considered a moderate on the slavery issue due to his support for \"popular sovereignty\" in which the inhabitants of each state and territory would decide the issue for themselves. There was John Bell of the Constitutional Union party, which was formed for the sole purpose of trying to win the border states and prevent both secession and Lincoln's election, which had no stated policy on slavery. And finally, of course, there was Lincoln and the Republicans. Lincoln was actually considered a moderate Republican and not an abolitionist in 1860, much to the concern of many anti-slavery activists, as he only sought to prevent the further expansion of slavery despite viewing it as a moral evil.   So, there were actually three prominent Presidental nominees for a moderate northerner to vote for, none of who's platforms would have conflicted with your hypothetical voter's apathy towards slavery and opposition to abolition. If your voter did not even view slavery as against their own morality, I would say it's very possible that they would have voted for Douglas or Bell, not Lincoln. However, while slavery was the predominant issue of the time and had already lead to the collapse of one major American political party in the Whigs, Lincoln's platform and campaign was not only focused on slavery. Your voter could have been swayed by the mass-produced pamphlets extolling Lincoln's humble upbringings or found a common cause with the Republicans on the issues of raising tariffs and protecting immigrants, or agreed with Republican campaign literature that railed against the frequent graft and corruption among Democratic administrations."

                "content": " There is almost certainly no single origin for the trope of the grim, mysterious, or downright evil wetland. It appears in cultures across the globe, in early texts as well as more recent media. Wetlands cover about a quarter of the Earth\u2019s land area, and there are many, many types\u2014peat bogs, salt marshes, mangrove swamps, floodplains\u2026 Given this impossible-to-cover scope, I\u2019m going to point to just a few factors that may play into the negative perception of such biomes, at least for some cultures, at least some of the time. Also I\u2019m interpreting the \u201cevil and foreboding\u201d of your question pretty widely, to encompass a spectrum of weird, supernatural, and frightening associations. \r    \r   I\u2019ll cover five broad categories of spookiness associated with wetlands: disease, predators, natural dangers, the concept of the liminal, and lawlessness. This isn\u2019t meant to be comprehensive, and there's undoubtedly more to be said. Also, as you\u2019ll see, aspects of each of these qualities inform and shade into one another. \r    \r   /u/lunes8 goes into this in more detail, so just briefly: the association between wetlands and disease isn\u2019t some relic of ancient superstition. Mosquitoes still kill about 700,000 people a year, far more than any other type of animal. As this map shows, more than half of the world\u2019s land was malarial prior to the twentieth century, and this half included nearly all regions that were historically densely populated. Cholera, typhoid, and other nasty diseases are likewise linked to water supply, and so to the landscapes from which people draw their water. In premodern Eurasia, the killing power of wetlands was associated with the \u201cmiasma,\u201d the fetid vapors of decay that rise from swamps. The ancient Greeks and Chinese alike attributed numerous fatal diseases to this fog, and the belief that miasma causes epidemics was prevalent into the 19th century before finally being replaced by germ theory.    \r    \r   Moving on to somewhat larger animals, wetlands are home to a number of dangerous beasts, including crocodilians, snakes, sharks and other predatory fish. The Sundarbans, the world\u2019s largest mangrove forest on the Bay of Bengal, contains a famously deadly population of tigers. Bears, boars, hippos, and other irascible megafauna also frequent these habitats, particularly at times of year when humans may also be more likely to enter them in search of resources like salmon or mast. Alongside\u2014and perhaps at least somewhat inspired by\u2014these biological creatures are the countless monsters said to dwell in swamps, marshes, lakes, and rivers: the Stymphalian birds and Hydra of Greek myth, the Australian bunyip, the mishipeshu or \u201cunderwater panther\u201d of indigenous North/Northeastern America, the nahang of the Iranian world (whose name means something like \u201cthe one who pulls its prey beneath the surface\u201d), and the Swamp Apes and Loch Ness Monsters of modern cryptozoology, to cite just a few. Some scary water dwellers, like Peg Powler of the Tees, may play \u201cnursery bogey\u201d roles, keeping children cautious around dangerous activities (like straying too close to deep water.) Others, like Grendel, are used to express complex anxieties about culture, history, and colonization. But in various forms, their stories are told worldwide, rooting a deep connection between wetlands and uncanny, often malevolent beings.  \r    \r   Probably equally important for the imagining of these monsters are the numerous natural dangers of wetland environments. Quicksand is probably the most cinematic. Drowning remains the leading non-congenital cause of death for children 1-4, and traditional balladry is full of woeful tales of drowned lovers. Simply getting lost in the wilds is incredibly dangerous, and shifting ground, mist, lack of landmarks, and thick vegetation can all make wetlands especially easy (and treacherous) places to get lost. The power of swamps to bewilder travelers is typified by will-o\u2019-the-wisps, glowing atmospheric phenomena (probably including flares of marsh gas as well as bioluminescent animals and plants) imagined as wicked spirits leading the unwary into the mire. \r    \r   The presence of supernatural beings is in turn linked to the perception of wetlands as liminal or transitional zones. They often occur at the junctures between different biomes, and around bodies of water which have often functioned as boundary markers for human societies. Wetland topography is regularly re-shaped by flooding and other forces, and constant transformation is also perceptible in the amphibious creatures that live in these areas. These and other associations have given an explicitly otherworldly cast to wetlands in numerous cultures. Many peoples associated with the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex along and east of the Mississippi River identify the wet, gloomy, and transformational aspects of swamps with the Lower World, a realm of chaos and death as well as wealth and fecundity. In Northwestern Europe, lakes and bogs are frequently depicted as passage points between the human world and otherworldly realms. Medieval texts like *Branwen ferch Ll\u0177r* and *Tydorel* describe the terrifying consequences of human interactions with the denizens of these underwater spaces. As with the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, there was a recognition that wetlands contained great wealth for those who dared to delve into them\u2014but that these rewards were often guarded by uncanny powers. There really was literal treasure in European wetlands\u2014many Bronze and Iron Age goods have been recovered from ritual deposit sites in pools, swamps, and marshes. The occasional association of such items with bog bodies, corpses eerily mummified in peat bogs, may have further contributed to the perception of wetlands as sites inhabited by bizarre and unsettling entities.  \r    \r   And of course, as /u/ThatHapsburgMapGuy says, wetlands have always been inhabited by human societies. While I disagree with their contention that the vilification of wetlands \u201cmust be recognized as a discourse of modernity\u201d--there are few more evil swamps in literature than Grendel and his mother\u2019s lair in Beowulf\u2014I fully agree that it is, also and often, \u201ca discourse of exclusion.\u201d Following their citation of James Scott, it\u2019s reasonable to say that wetlands are up there with mountains and deserts as biomes that have historically resisted systems of state control and legibility. Border zones, difficult to map, dangerous to outsiders for all the reasons discussed above, very hard to pacify with roads and fortresses\u2014wetlands have long attracted those who seek to live outside (or on the margins of) states. People move to, or stay in, these zones for a variety of reasons: for example, holy solitude (like Saint Guthlac), banditry (as depicted in the great Chinese novel *Shuihu zhuan*, \u2018Water Margin\u2019 or \u2018Outlaws of the Marsh\u2019), freedom from taxation and conscription (as with the runaway serfs who contributed to the formation of Cossack communities along the Dnieper), or anticolonial resistance (the last native Prince of Wales, Dafydd ap Gruffydd, and the Wampanoag sachem Metacomet are only two of the many resistance leaders who made their last stands in swamps). From the perspective of central governments, these regions and their intractable communities are easy to depict as enemies of civilization, even as states covet the resources they hold.  \r    \r   All of these features feed into the fictional \u201cbad reputation\u201d of wetlands. Note, though, that especially the last two factors can have a positive valence, depending on narratorial perspective. For every foreboding swamp, there is an idyllic riverbank, Yoda\u2019s hut, or rebel stronghold. These contest the discourse of wetlands as obstacles to human flourishing, and insist instead on their ecological, social, and political importance."

This will make us one of the 125 largest subreddits on this site.  This is going to present a few new challenges for us.  Here they are with their answer.  **1)  Default status.**  Askhistorians WILL NEVER BECOME A DEFAULT SUB IF WE HAVE ANY SAY SO.  I believe the way we put it in moderator discussion was, \"I would rather burn this sub to the ground than let it become a default sub.\"  That was me, I said that, and everyone agreed.  We have already set the system to not allow this sub to become part of the default set.  **2)  More posters**  We recognize that there are more people posting here.  Therefore we have a few things in place.  Firstly, we will be contacting users we have singled out for their quality posting to become moderators.  This will bring the team up to about 17 moderators.  This will allow moderators to participate as well as moderate as it will take some of the stress off of them.  Additionally we would like to direct you to [the Panel thread and the Quality Contributor thread.  If you feel that you would like to receive flair or nominate someone for flair, feel free to use these links to nominate yourself or others.  Additionally, more posters means more users unfamiliar with this subreddits rules and culture.  So let me direct you again to OUR RULES as well as our GUIDELINES FOR RULES.  Think of them like this, the Rules = Constitution, Clarification = The Laws.  Both are enforceable, and will be.  We also request that you view the POPULAR QUESTIONS thread before you ask.  **3)Now we need to also make a few of our rules clear to you guys, again.  These are the important rules**  1)  20 year rule.  If it has occurred in the past twenty years, it is off limits pending moderator review.  2)  NO RACISM, SEXISM, HOMOPHOBIA, OR OTHER BIGOTED BEHAVIOR  I am so not kidding.  Do not think you are being clever, we have many historians in this sub who actually specialize in racial, sexual, or gender history INCLUDING A MOD.  We have had more than enough experience in recognizing the behavior.  Yes, if you come here and post something racist and you are from one of the several racist or other biggoted subreddits, we will not only thoroughly thrash your propaganda, but we will also ban you.  Yes, we will read through your posting history to see if you have a history of bigotry.  3)  No soapboxing or speechifying.  You hate America?  Fine, go somewhere else.  You a die hard college communist?  Great.  Go somewhere else.  This is not the place to recruit, to rabble rouse, to instigate.  At this point we have plenty of experience spotting that too.  You will have your post removed.  4)  Copy Pasting **ANY SOURCE** as your only way of posting, is VERBOTEN.  People come here to receive quality, in depth analysis from historians, history students, and history buffs.  Please assume the OP of the question isn't a complete moron and has googled for the answer.  Additionally, this is /r/askhistorians, not /r/askgoogle.  Yes, you can copy and paste a source and give a summary of that link and source,  but simply throwing up a link or a wall of copied text is intellectually lazy and will result in the post being removed.  5)  On topic, relevant humor only.  No memes, advice animals, reaction gifs, or funny videos are allowed.  The humor cannot be top tiered comments.  Humor is allowed to stray more off topic in *meta threads only*.  Jokes otherwise must be relevant, on topic, and hopefully funny.  I personally hate puns.  6)  Topic drift.  The original Godwins Law stated that the longer a UseNet conversation went the more likely Hitler was to be brought up.  It meant the thread was dead.  Here we also avoid topic drift.  A logical progression of topics being brought up is allowed, but please, don't let a thread on 19th Century agriculture end up about cow tipping.  7) Anecdotes are frowned upon.  Unless you were there yourself at the event, its probably not a strong enough source.  8) If you are guessing, or you heard from something somewhere some time ago, don't bother.  We will delete with extreme prejudice.  9) Wikipedia is the worst possible source you can use.  Its acceptable at times, and in a pinch, but it really isn't a good source.  If you couldn't use it in a paper, it probably wont work here.   **4) Eternal~~kerri~~ September  In light of the ever expanding number of users, of course there will be cries of Eternal September.  The moderation team can only do so much.  We need the user base to assist us by flagging violating posts as spam.  We also want you to understand **we enforce rules here**.  If you have a problem with the rules, address them to the moderation team, but Braveheart style speeches do not endear us to your plight (neither does calling us faggots after we ban you).  The level of our enforcement and strictness of enforcement, as well as our patience is directly inverse to the level of chicanery in the sub.  The more the rules are violated, the more people flagrantly violate them, the more people thumb their noses at the mods, the more likely we are to increase the intensity and harshness of our moderation.  This is your sub, we just enforce the rules.  If your fellow users cannot police themselves and you are not willing to assist in helping them understand they are violating the rules, then we will have to enforce the rules more and more strictly until we suck every bit of fun out of the sub.\n\nAssistant:"

This is a common argument I\u2019ve heard - that disease epidemics often swept across the continent well in advance of direct contact between settlers and Native people. However in recent years there has also been a lot of pushback against these claims. I happened to be reading a chapter in the *Routledge Handbook of the Archaeology of Indigenous-Colonial Interaction in the Americas* by archeologist Matthew Liebmann and he summarizes a number of studies challenging this view:  \u201cAcross the lands known today as the United States and Canada, archaeologists have found no evidence to support the notion that pandemic disease events swept across the continent prior to direct, face-to-face contacts with Europeans. In fact, Dean Snow has documented increasing population among the Mohawk Iroquois in upstate New York during the mid-1500s. His studies (e.g. 1995) suggest that significant depopulation did not occur among the Haudenosaunee prior to direct and sustained encounters with non-Indigenous peoples.\u201d  And further:  \u201cEric Jones (2014) has used spatial analysis to model the relationships between the timing and location of epidemic disease events across North America. His results found no evidence of diseases spreading widely over short periods of time in the sixteenth century. Individual disease events afflicted local populations during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries but did not spread over long distances until the 1690s. This finding corresponds with regional studies of the Upper Mississippi Valley (Betts 2006), the Northeast Haudenosaunee (Snow 1995; Snow and Lanphear 1988) and the Great Lakes Wendat-Tionontate (Warrick 2003), which all document highly localized disease and depopulation events that did not occur simultaneously.\u201d  That said, are there accounts of disease spreading faster than settlers in some regions and time periods? Does he overstate the case a bit?\n\nAssistant:"

                "role": "assistant",
                "content": " The quick and dirty answer is it's complicated, and there is no one story of disease spread in the Americas.  The more complex answer is disease was but one part of a toxic colonial cocktail that not only increased excess mortality in the years following contact, but also decreased fertility, making a demographic rebound difficult. Disease, in combination with warfare, intentional resource deprivation, territorial displacement, and slaving raids all significantly impacted demographic trends after contact. In some places, like the Great Plains, we have evidence of periodic disease spreading in advance of consistent European contact. In some places, like the U.S. Southeast, it took more than two centuries of disruption before the first verifiable smallpox epidemic made it's way into the interior.  I'll quote this previous answer on evidence of disease in Plains Winter Counts for evidence of disease penetrating into the heart of the continent in advance of European settlers.  Northern Plains tribes (like the Lakota, Kiowa, Mandan, and Dakota) kept historical records in the form of Winter Counts. Winter Counts were a historical record, a list of year names representing the most significant events in the life of the band. Pictorial representations of that event served as a reminder, a kind of mnemonic device, for the keeper of the count to retell the history of the band. We know of 53 Winter Counts that together provide a historical record of the Northern Plains from 1682 to 1920. By compiling the Winter Counts together into a master narrative we can establish a chronology, cross-check errors, and be fairly certain the events depicted are accurate to roughly two years. From this narrative we can determine the frequency and impact of infectious disease on the Northern Plains populations before the arrival of permanent European-descent settlers.  All but two of the 53 Winter Counts record some instance of infectious disease between 1682 and 1920. If we ignore the earliest Winter Counts (due to lack of cross-reference capacity) and focus on the time period from 1714 to 1919, Native American populations on the northern plains endured 36 major epidemics in two centuries. An epidemic occurred roughly every 5.7 years for the entire population, but varied by band. The Mandan saw the recurrence of epidemics every 9.7 years, while the Yanktonai averaged an epidemic every 15.8 years. The longest epidemic free interval for any band was 45 years for the Southern Lakota, and the shortest was 14 years for the Mandan. Northern Plains pandemics, when an epidemic effects all, or nearly all, of the Northern Plains populations, occurred in 1781 (smallpox), 1801 (smallpox), 1818 (smallpox), 1837-38 (smallpox), 1844 (measles or smallox), and 1888 (measles).  Taken together, we see a picture develop, one where epidemics were raging in at least one portion of the northern plains during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Epidemics seemed to hit pregnant women particularly hard, with increased mortality noted in expectant mothers. Overall mortality for each epidemic is difficult to determine. The Blue Thunder (Yanktonai) Winter Count states many died in the 1801-2 smallpox epidemic, but few died in the 1837-38 or 1844-45 epidemics. Oglala Winter Counts describe the 1844-45 epidemic as severe and widespread. The severity of the mortality from an epidemic likely varied between groups due to previous exposure to the pathogen (leaving the survivors with immunity) as well as nutritional stress since periods of famine often preceded an epidemic event.  What does this tell us about disease events beyond the frontier? Epidemics of infectious disease occurred before significant, sustained face-to-face contact with Europeans (3-5 epidemics before the establishment of permanent trading posts). Epidemics of infectious disease arrived in waves, one roughly every 5 to 10 years, burned through the pool of susceptible hosts, and left long periods of stasis in their wake. An entire generation could be born, live and die between waves of disease for some bands, while others were hit with multiple events in quick succession. Even in the same epidemic of the same pathogen, mortality could differ based on immunity from previous exposure and the stressors (famine, poor nutrition, displacement, etc.) influencing the health of the band. Winter Counts tell a story of dynamic populations persisting and adapting in the face of recurrent high mortality events, and provide an unique perspective into the influence of disease on populations beyond the frontier.  Now, in the U.S. Southeast, the first verifiable epidemic to penetrate the interior did not occur for almost two centuries after Columbus.  In the Spanish Florida missions, early disease outbreaks failed to travel beyond the immediate mission environs due to contested buffer zones between rival polities. Only after English slaving raids changed the social environment, erased these protective buffer zones, and destabilized the region did the first verifiable smallpox pandemic sweep the greater U.S. Southeast.  When attacks by slavers disrupted normal life, hunting and harvesting outside the village defenses became deadly exercises. Nutritional stress led to famine as food stores were depleted and enemies burned growing crops. Displaced nations attempted to carve new territory inland, escalating violence as the shatterzone of English colonial enterprises spread across the region. The slave trade united the Southeast in a commercial enterprise involving the long-range travel of human hosts, crowded susceptible hosts into dense palisaded villages, and weakened host immunity through the stresses of societal upheaval, famine, and warfare (Kelton). All of these factors were needed to propagate a smallpox epidemic across the Southeast, and all of these factors led to increase mortality once the epidemic arrived.  Examining the greater context reveals how the cocktail of colonial stressors often stacked the deck against host immune defense before epidemics arrived. Plains Winter Counts recount disease mortality consistently increased in the year following nutritional stress (Sundstrom), and this link was understood by European colonists who routinely burned growing crops and food stores when invading Native American lands, trusting disease and depopulation would soon follow (Calloway). Mortality increased in populations under nutritional stress, geographically displaced due to warfare and slaving raids, and adapting to the breakdown of traditional social support systems caused by excess conquest-period mortality. Context highlights why many Native Americans, like modern refugee populations facing similar concurrent physiological stress, had a decreased capacity to respond to infection, and therefore higher mortality to periodic epidemics.  Humans are demographically capable of rebounding from high mortality events, like epidemics, provided other sources of excess mortality are limited. In the mid-twentieth century when the Ach\u00e9 of Paraguay moved to the missions ~38% of the population died from respiratory diseases alone. However, the Ach\u00e9 rallied quickly and are now a growing population. The key factor for population survival after high mortality events is limiting other demographic shocks, like violent incursions from outsiders, providing sufficient food resources, and the territory needed for forage and hunt to supplement food intake.  When the colonial cocktail arrived in full force demographic recovery became challenging. Warfare and slaving raids added to excess mortality, while simultaneously displacing populations from their stable food supply, and forcing refugees into crowded settlements where disease can spread among weakened hosts. Later reservations restricted access to foraged foods and exacerbated resource scarcity where disease could follow quickly on the heels of famine. The greater cocktail of colonial insults, not just the pathogens themselves, decreased population size and prevented rapid recovery during the conquest.

                "content": " #Part 1  While I generally agree with /u/retarredroof that being more specific will yield a better chance to analyze a situation, I think we can paint a broad, yet somewhat accurate, picture by looking at several different instances. To start this picture, we can look back on several past answers I've written for previous questions.  * Is there a recognized \"Native American\" philosophy, similar to how Western thought and Eastern thought is generalized?  This answer explains that for Indigenous Peoples, we most certainly had our own understandings of philosophy and what it meant to lead a good life. This will ultimately differ from Tribe to Tribe, but it provides a foundation for understanding that while Tribes certainly do not reinforce the \"Noble Savage\" myth,^1 which is essentially what your question is getting at, there was intellectual thought and reasoning behind model conduct that individuals of Tribes were to maintain for their collective identity.  * Was sovereignty a part of Native American political thought?  In a similar matter, I discuss here how politics was also a very ingrained concept for many Indigenous Peoples. This is to say that life was not really \"simple\" in the sense that people just ate, hunted, and slept. Nations were maintained and doing so often required high levels of organization and structure in order to logistically provide for these needs and protect their land holdings.  * Were Native North Americans egalitarian?  This answer probably has the most applicability to your question. It describes that for many Tribes, particularly my own, society overall was more egalitarian, which I think many exaggerate for being \"idyllic,\" though I also wouldn't say that isn't too far from the truth.  There are two major areas we can look at to further inform our conclusion on this matter, to access if Tribes were \"idyllic,\" or at least if they happened to be different enough that we can see varying degrees of overall prosperity. These are culture and practicality. For the first, the last link addresses this:  >What often determined how egalitarian a society was is the societal structure and resources. Many Native American communities were hunter-gatherer societies. Some were farmers. Some had a combination. However, most were communal. This caused them to have a more egalitarian society than what we see today because the \"wealth,\" so to speak, was distributed more evenly because life was organized around kinship ties and reciprocity for the well being of the whole community. This lifestyle was rooted in both cultural value as well as economic value.  >In terms of cultural value, sharing, gift-giving, and trading were all highly valued because what was given was expected to be repaid in some way later in the future (hence the \"reciprocity\"). This was because resources were often limited and the gaining of resources required community effort, more than what one person could provide.  >This leads into what we could consider the economic value. Because many hunter-gatherers were nomadic or semi-nomadic, they were not able to keep vast reserves of food on hand. They needed to carry what they needed. This means that they could not sustain a population beyond a certain size. Thus, many native societies were balanced in number of births and deaths. And when there isn't a surplus of food, you are more dependent on others of your community who have also gathered enough food. This indicates that not one person was in charge of all the food. It was all shared and \"owned\" by the community. Unlike in agricultural and industrial societies, structures where mass production of resources can be carried out by a few, hunter-gatherers had to share everything in order for everyone to survive. This meant that resources, particularly food and shelter, were distributed equally. Individual wealth and prestige might differ, but not so much as to offset the balance of the society.  Beyond this, let's examine some key areas to better inform this position.  ##Government  One of the most well known examples of Indigenous Government that existed prior to the United States and even colonization by European powers is that of the the Haudenosaunee, or the Iroquois Confederacy. The origin stories of their own nations give a glimpse into the social environment it was born out of and also exemplify Indigenous values that standards of the Old Ways were based off, though they were not always followed.  >The Haudenosaunee ... are an ancient people of North America. Our tradition states that our people originated in the northwestern woodlands of North America ... Our existence in these lands has not been one of absolute peace and tranquility. We have had to work hard to develop the civilization we enjoy. There was a time when or lands were torn by conflict and death. There were times when certain individuals attempted to establish themselves as rulers of the people through exploitation and repression.  >We emerged from those times to establish a strong democratic and spiritual Way of Life. The confederate state of the Haudenosaunee became the embodiment of democratic principles that continue to guide our peoples today. The Haudenosaunee became the first \"United Nations,\" established on a firm foundation of peace, harmony and respect.  >Within the Haudenosaunee, all member nations are equal, regardless of size. Within their national territories the member nations are autonomous, but all adhere to the central principles of democracy that we agreed to at the formation of the Confederacy (Akwesasne Notes, 2005, p. 26). . .  >All of this political activity is set in the roots of an ancient tradition of the spirituality of our peoples. This cosmology places the Haudenosaunee in a balanced, familiar relationship with the universe and the Earth ... This philosophy taught us to treat the Natural World with great care. Our institutions, practices, and technologies were developed with a careful eye to their potential for disturbing the delicate balance in which we live (p. 27).  The Haudenosaunee explain here that for them, before the formation of their government, they experienced many of the same problems we encountered after colonization and into our modern day. Wars, fighting, killings, and injustice did exist in various forms. These were carried out at times by Natives against Natives. **However...** The occurrence of these actions are regularly filtered through a Western lens. As the Haudenosaunee describe, they, as a people, were not governed by carnal instincts that put them at odds with others and with the Natural World. Rather, they sought to cooperate with their environment, recognizing their role in it and the balance they should maintain.  When forming their government, they based it off what would become known as The Great Law of Peace. This law, which is their constitution, provided the model conduct for their citizens to emulate. This law was provided by a man called the Peacemaker.  >The first principle that the Peacemaker set forth was indisputable to those who heard his words. He said that it has come to pass that in this land humans beings are seen to abuse on another ... From that initial explanation--that the Giver of Life (later addressed as the Great Creator) did not intend that human beings abuse one another--he proposed that human societies must form governments that will serve to prevent the abuse of human beings by other human beings and that will ensure peace among nations and peoples (p. 32). . .  >Peace was to be defined not as the simple absence of war or strife, but as the active striving of humans for the purpose of establishing universal justice. Peace was defined as the product of a society that strives to establish concepts that correlate to the English words power, reason, and righteousness (p. 33).  Here, we see a good blend of practicality *and* Culture. In order to sustain the very principles of their society, they needed to conduct themselves in accordance with this law. It is important to note that this law was not written down. It is an Oral Tradition that is enforced by internalization of the law, which fosters a strong constitution in individuals of their nation. This observance is what was noticed by the colonial powers and their misunderstandings led them to conclude that their primitiveness is what resulted in their supposed nobility rather than a complex spiritual and philosophical lifestyle in which their society was dependent upon. This, of course, was encouraged due to their collective nature. They worked more on a collectivist mentality rather than an individualistic one, the latter being more common in the Western World today and which is the lens many non-Indigenous researchers regularly peer through. Their collectivistic nature is then demonstrated in the rights established for citizens of their nation: all leaders are elected democratically, councils have the power to nominate and advise elections, all citizens have full rights, all citizens can travel freely, women had all the rights as men (women even were in charged of selecting leaders), immigrants were provided protection for under their laws, individual nations of the Confederacy maintained their autonomy though separate national boundaries had been abolished. For individual internalizing this law, it can be summed up in this phrase:  >A society was socialized to the ideology that, if an injustice occurs, it is their moral duty to defend the oppressed again their oppressors (p. 38)."

                "content": " This is a complicated question, in part because the French public and the French government are two different beasts. Also, the situation evolved a lot over the decades.  The official governmental stance immediately following the war was, to sum it up, that \"Vichy wasn't France\". During the war, after the Appeal of 18 June (1940), De Gaulle established himself as the head of a government-in-exile named \"Free France\", and that idea was perpetuated after the Liberation, by the ordinance of 9 August 1944, stating that the legitimacy of the Vichy regime was, I quote, \"null and void\".  This is also when the national myth took roots for a while that \"most French people were resistants\", at least to a point or after a fashion, even if they didn't all took arms. There were large purges at the Liberation against past collaborators, for sure, but the dominant worry seemed to be if those purges weren't, you know, too harsh. (I mean, there *were* cases of excessive, popular violence, but not to the point of the \"black legend\" of the so-called \"wild purge\", with fanciful figures circulating back then, pretending more than 100 000 people were lynched. The more recent historiography, like Fran\u00e7ois Rouquet and Fabrice Virgili's *Les Fran\u00e7aises, Les Fran\u00e7ais et l'Epuration* \\[2018\\], points out that this discourse was actually mainly a way to target communists.)  That idea of a \"mostly resistant France\" was also the one largely sold by the French movie industry for decades, with tonally serious movies like Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment's *La Bataille du rail* (*The Battle of the Rails*, 1946), *Le P\u00e8re tranquille* (*Mr. Orchid*, 1946) and later *Paris br\u00fble-t-il?* (*Is Paris burning?*, 1966) as well as Jean-Pierre Melville's *L'Arm\u00e9e des ombres* (*Army of Shadows*, 1969), to name a few, or even comedic movies, most notably G\u00e9rard Oury's *La Grande Vadrouille* (\"The Great Stroll\", 1966), which remained the most successful movie of the history of French box-office until *Titanic*. Claude Autant-Lara's *La Travers\u00e9e de Paris* (\"The Trip across Paris\", 1956), another comedy, was an oddity for its rare choice to show a less stellar aspect of the times, focusing on black market.  During that same era, Robert Aron's *Histoire de Vichy* (\"History of Vichy\", 1954) was largely accepted as the reference book on the Vichy regime, substantiating the (actually revisionist) \"sword and shield thesis\", meaning De Gaulle was the \"sword\" fighting the nazis but Petain was the \"shield\" protecting the French people from them and collaborating as little as possible with the Germans.  De Gaulle's death in 1970, however, proved to be a turning point, opening gates for a less heroic narrative. 1971 documentary *Le Chagrin et la piti\u00e9* (*The Sorrow and the Pity*), by Marcel Ophuls, depicted a French population during Occupation made of only very few resistants, very few collaborators, some profiteers, and a vast majority of people in a \"wait-and-see\" attitude. 1973 saw the French translation of Robert Paxton's historical essay *Vichy France* (originally published in '72 in USA), which completely challenged Robert Aron's version of History, and proved that the Vichy regime, not only did not minimize its collaboration, but went actually out of its way, most notably when it came to round up and deport Jews to the nazi concentration camps. Both the documentary and the essay generated heated debates in the public opinion, as did Louis Malle's movie *Lacombe Lucien* in 1974, focusing on a young, coarse French peasant becoming a collaborator during the last months of the war.  In 1978, *L'Express* magazine published an interview of Louis Darquier, former \"Commissioner-General for Jewish Affairs\" under the Vichy regime, who fled to Spain after the Liberation. Among other things, the man allegated that Auschwitz gas chambers were used \"only to gas lice\". The interview was met with an immense backlash, creating a scandal that put the spotlight on two things. First, the fate of Jews under the Vichy regime, an aspect of things that until then was relatively sidelined in the general representations of that era. And second, the not only remaining, but growing, presence of negationist people, most notably the French academic and Holocaust-denier Robert Faurisson, who applauded to Darquier's interview.  It is also worth noting that this is the same year that Maurice Papon became Minister of Finance. Papon was already an official during the Vichy regime and nonetheless continued his career afterwards, most notably becoming *pr\u00e9fet de police* (Chief of Police) of Paris from 1958 to 1967, where he was responsible for bloody repression during the Algerian War (Paris massacre of 1961 and Charonne Station massacre of 1962). His past finally caught up to him in 1981 when it was discovered and exposed by the newspaper *Le Canard encha\u00een\u00e9*, leading to the start of a long and highly mediatic trial under the accusation of crime against humanity.  Meanwhile, the \"Vichy wasn't France\" stance kept being the official position of every French government of the 5th Republic. Elected in 1981, Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand stayed in line, about this, with his predecessors from the right, De Gaulle, Pompidou and Giscard d'Estaing.  But the question of the fate of Jewish people under the Vichy Regime became more and more pregnant following the publication, that same year, of Robert Paxton (again) and Michael Marrus' *Vichy et les Juifs* (Vichy and the Jews), a violent denounciation (Paxton would later recognize himself that he was at first a bit too harsh). More particularly, the public opinion's on this started to cristalise around a particular, symbolic event: the \"Vel' d'Hiv' Roundup\", a mass arrest of 13000 foreign Jewish families by the French police.   In 1992, for the 50 years commemoration of the round up, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand made a first symbolic step by being the first French president to show up and lay flowers, but he didn't speak there, and he kept repeating in interviews the same official position, saying \"Don't demand accounts to the Republic, \\[...\\] the 'French State' \\[i.e. Vichy regime\\] wasn't the Republic\" that same year, or, in 1994, \"I will not apologize in the name of France. The Republic has nothing to do with it. I do not believe France is responsible.\"  However, in 1995, his successor, Jacques Chirac, finally reversed this position, stating in a public speech for the 53th commemoration of the Round Up: \"These black hours will stain our history forever and are an injury to our past and our traditions. \\[...\\] France, home of the Enlightenment and the Rights of Man, land of welcome and asylum, France commited on that day the irreparable.\" And in 1998, Maurice Papon was eventually given a ten-year-sentence as complicit in crimes against humanity for having organized eight \"death trains\". (Aged 88 at the time, he would only serve three years due to his old age and medical problems.) The two events were catalyst for a large reckoning in the broad public about France's involvement of the World War II.  I won't develop much further due to the \"20 years rules\" of the subreddit, but I believe it is worth noting quickly that every French president since then, regardless of political orientation, has kept in line with Jacques Chirac's position; yet also that, nonetheless, both the \"Vichy wasn't France\" stance and, even, the \"shield thesis\" (in particular the idea that Vichy actually protected French Jews) are still parts of the Far Right's speeches."

                "content": " Unfortunately for the average soldier of the Napoleonic Wars, there was no real standard for the care and upkeep for prisoners of war. Although the military culture of the period maintained a series of loose conventions surrounding POWs, the honoring these conventions was often depended greatly upon circumstances and which army had captured them.  Treatment of POWs often varied quite heavily by theater during the Napoleonic Wars and often privileged officers over enlisted and NCOs. For the approximately 110000 troops of the *Grande Armee* captured in Russia, they had to navigate within a system that was often quite fluctuating and mercurial.   The official POW policy of the Russian Ministry of War, which was responsible  for the POWs, was in a number of ways typical of states in the late-eighteenth century. The Ministry sent out regulations in which prisoners would be relayed through proper channels for intelligence and safely conveyed by the militia into secure rear areas for detention.  The Ministry also issued Articles prohibiting despoiling POWs of clothing or buying valuables, but like other such regulations in the Napoleonic Era, these were honored more in breach than practice. As the scale of the campaign overburdened the militia and military forces guarding the prisoners, Emperor Alexander II shifted responsibility of POWs to the Ministry of Police and armed convoys of POWs  to the Russian interior with Astrakhan, Perm, Orenburg, Saratov and Vyatka being the main POW depots. Civilian authorities in these areas were responsible for the care and upkeep of these POWs, but the administrative poverty of the imperial state often meant that local authorities were overburdened caring for these foreign elements. The POWs were often quartered in private residences and closely monitored by the police. As the war swung decisively against Napoleon in 1813/14, there was a lessening of restrictions of POW movement and prisoners were allowed to send unsealed correspondence, which would be monitored by police.  While bureaucratic chaos and violation of regulations was relatively normal for POW treatment in this period, there were a number of elements in this POW experience that reflect the unique nature of their captor. The Russians divided up prisoners by nationality, or, more accurately, the nationality of their unit, and treated the troops differently. For German units, the Russian Ministry of War saw them as potential recruits for the Russian foreign legions being assembled in Orel. As the Tsar began to style himself as the Liberator of Europe, there was a growing perception that the Germans would be the chief ally in this endeavor and the Russian authorities tended not to treat the Germans as POWs, but rather as unfortunate soldiers dragooned by Napoleon. Spanish and Portuguese POWs were also treated better than average because the Treaty of Velikie Luki established Russo-Spanish alliance and the Russians were likewise thinking of establishing an Iberian foreign legion for the upcoming German campaign in 1813. French POWs often found that their knowledge of French culture and the French language was valuable cultural capital inside the Russian interior as the Francophile nobility and gentry needed tutors and other household appointments.  In contrast, the Russian state had little thought to Dutch and Italian POWs regarded Polish prisoners as traitors and not subject to the standard conventions as their other *Grande Armee* comrades. Polish POWs typically could not send correspondence home and officers could not manage their estates. The state often assigned the  Poles to punitive military service in the distant provinces and the Poles were among the last cohorts of POWs to be repatriated after the Napoleonic Wars had ended.   The use of the Poles in punitive military service was not just an expression of the growing antipathy of the Russian state to any imagined sign of Polish rebellion, but also reflected the very functional approach the imperial state had towards emigration. In his study of imperial citizenship, the historian Eric Lohr had classified the emigration policy of the Romanovs from Peter I to Alexander II as \"attract and hold,\" in that the state offered foreign specialists the tantalizing prospects of land and status while instituting various policies that would keep this foreign element in place. Even prior to the Napoleonic Wars, POW policy sometimes shifted into this paradigm; non-Christian POWs (Ottoman Turks, Crimean Tartars, and other Muslims and Jews) captured in the eighteenth-century wars were often encouraged to convert to Orthodoxy and given a payment to settle in Russia as subjects of the tsar. The POWs of the *Grande Armee* sometimes had a skillset that was in short supply in the interior and therefore a number of POWs elected to become subjects of the empire. Western-trained physicians and surgeons were often able to skip a number of the formalities of becoming subjects of the tsar on account of their relative rarity and need for these professionals in the army. Likewise, some officers could find their rank could open doors into service in the Russian state closed to the enlisted men. But the bulk of the POWs were not so fortunate and often had to deal with the Russian state. The regulations of July 1813 laid out the process for this process. POWs were to swear allegiance to the Emperor, decide which profession to pursue, and were restricted from settling in the cities of St. Petersburg and Moscow  or newly acquired territories of Poland and Finland. These newly minted Russian subjects were incorporated into the *soslovie* estate system and since they were professionals, they often enjoyed higher privileges than serfs as townsmen in the interior. In a departure from prior practice, the state did not require the POW's conversion to Orthodoxy as a condition for being a subject, but did maintain that to marry, these resident aliens had to convert. Marriage also became a pretext to keep these POWs in the country during the rounds of repatriation between 1813-1815. The Russian state held that any POW married to a Russian subject had to remain in the empire, especially if they had children. Childless marriages allowed the POW to be repatriated, but not his wife, who was then given permission to remarry.   Using marriage as a pretext to hold these individuals is apparent in the enigmatic story of Jean-Baptiste Savin, one of the last living veterans of the *Grande Armee*. Although Savin embellished his biography by claiming to be an officer and recipient of the Legion of Honor, claims that an eager public both in Russian and France were eager to believe in the 1890s, the few surviving records indicate Savin was an NCO in 2nd Light Infantry with some skills as a cabinet maker. His woodworking skills allowed him a place in the *soslovie* system and he settled in Saratov on the Volga River. In 1836, Savin appealed to the Russian government to be sent back to France, but the state denied it on account of his marriage to a Russian subject and their children. Savin subsequently became something of a local fixture in his community, adapted a Russian name (Nicolai Andreevich), and his advanced age made him especially notable. By the 1890s, Savin's story became particularly poignant in an era of warming Franco-Russian relations. The press in both countries reported on Savin's death in 1894 despite some obvious gaps in his official biography.   Savin's fate was in many ways emblematic of the choices many POWs faced in Russian captivity. After being relayed to the interior, POWs had to make hard choices about their future and these choices, unbeknownst to them, often limited their own subsequent freedom of action. The Russian state held the initiative in this relationship and could decide individual POW's fate based upon a set of highly arbitrary criteria. The POWs that remained in Russia were then incorporated into an already long-established Russian system for assimilating and controlling permanent foreign residents. Those few that reached advanced age like Savin became minor local celebrities in no small measure because of the romance of the Napoleonic Wars tended to eclipse anti-French sentiments almost as soon as Napoleon's defeat in 1815.   *Sources*  Janet M.

Ok so I recently read a claim that the Europeans regarded ancient Bengal as the richest country to trade with. There are accounts of the wealth in this region from many sources ranging from Marco Polo to Ibn Battuta. Incidentally, the Dutch East India Company and the British counterpart were based out of this region. These were two of the richest companies of all time, the VOC especially.  And at a topical level it makes sense. Before the age of banking and finance, wealth was almost always a function of agricultural output. Bengal has always been one of the most fertile spots on the planet. So it only follows that it would be a wealthy place as well. So my question I guess is: is there any merit to these claims, and if so, the hell happened? Why is the region so poor now? And is there hope for the future? Thanks in advance.\n\nAssistant:"

I'll try to explain it more from Bangladesh's perspective, since it's the independent entity.   **History** - I think bengal's fall is mostly related to it's unfortunate history  Bengal is formed out of Ganga-Brahmaputra delta. As a result there's a lot of arable, fertile land - great for agriculture. It's also very densely populated, and has always been. Due to it's resources Bengal would be constantly annexed by empires - there were some empires that formed out of bengal (i can only remember Gupta, Pala, Sena of the top of my head).  Bengal was fairly prosperous under Islamic and later mughal rule. Akbar did some changes to the system that benefitted Bengal - as a whole bengal was managed by a subadar (a viceroy/governor if you will). Aurangzeb was so impressed by bengal's production he called it a paradise. Travellers like Ibn Battuta mention how prosperous it was. *So yes, I'd say there is merit to the claims of prosperity, considering the high output of tribute that bengal offered to the mughals.*  I'd say **bengal's fall** started when British East India Company defeated Siraj ud doula (nawab of bengal) in battle of plassey. This resulted in mir jafar coming in power as a puppet to British. The bengal presidency as a whole was a bad time for bengal - british forced the farmers to cultivate more profitable crop such as indigo compared to things like rice (which the farmers preferred since it was edible, less draining for the land and gave better output). Most of the indigo profit would be taken by the zaminders - leading to the indigo revolt. This indigo incident is just an example, during bengal presidency bengal suffered from massives famines specially in 1770 (killing off some 10 million people) - caused by a mixture of crop failure, hoarding, bad company policy and unwillingness of company officers to take action.  The sepoy mutiny at 1857 also damaged the reputation. However Bengal was a centre of industry - Calcutta being the capital. West Bengal had most of the industrial and processing plants, while East bengal (now bangladesh) handled the production of raw materials. Jute and muslin were the main cash crop, however bengal's muslin industry was thwarted as british favored imported textiles from england and cut off the fingers of muslin producers.  Due to west bengal being more industrialized - this introduced large wealth disparity between the two bengals. The east saw west as the ones stealing their profits, while the west saw them as uncultured mussulmans. The religious conflicts were also escalating, the british instigated it to turn the situation to their advantage. In 1905 the british divided the two bengals, orissa and bihar for better governance - something the east supported as this would allow creation of industrial plants and infrastructure in east bengal with Dhaka as the capital. Due to hindu opposition in west bengal, british reunited the two bengals. This only served to strain the relationships further.   As a result of this plus the fact that east is mainly muslim - they opted for Muslim league. jinnah's direct action day only worsened the matter. In the end East bengal became part of pakistan, while west remained part of India.  This was good and bad, on one hand east finally got rid of west - meaning infrastructure would now be built in east bengal. But at the same time Pakistan's treatment to bengal wasn't much different to British's. They once again viewed bengal as inferior, still sticking to british martial race theory (bengalis weren't a martial race). The widespread disparity in industry, wealth; pakistan using bengals money to only improve pakistan, discrimination started to divide the two areas. Considering the distance and difference in culture this country wasn't probably going to last anyway. Final straw was Pakistan's reluctance to give Sheikh mujib prime minister's position (despite him winning majority vote. Pakistan struck first on 21st march and we had the Independece war of 1971 (with a side of genocide by pakistan).  Why is bengal no longer a rich and prosperous country? Because since British rule leading up to Pakistan - bengal has constantly been discriminated against, the infrastructure has never been built to that scale, bengal's profit in agriculture has been transferred and used to develop other areas. After independence - the nation has been marred by corruption and once again lack of development in important sectors, not to mention constant bullying by it's neighbours. Bad govt decisions, high unemployment rate, high population density, lack of natural resources - all make it a very hard situation to control.  Is there any hope for future? Well bangladesh is part of the next eleven economy, the economy as a whole is improving. But corruption is still rampant in country, export/import isn't properly regulated and trade isn't encouraged by govt as much as needed. bangladesh also suffers from a bad case of brain drain. Political climate is unstable. Global warming and rising water levels put the country in grave danger. - so as a whole, draw your own conclusions (i'm not a economist lol)."

                "content": " Gangs of New York has *many* historic inaccuracies, and this scene in particular is one of them. First, it perpetuates a popular myth that immigrants, especially Irish Catholic immigrants, were the bulk of rank and file in the Union army. To quote James McPherson:  >\"The substantial number of immigrants in the Union army gave rise to longstanding southern myth that \"the majority of Yankee soldiers were foreign hirelings.\" But in fact quite the opposite was true. Immigrants were proportionately under-represented in the Union's armed services. Of some two million white soldiers and sailors, half a million had been born abroad. While immigrants therefore constituted 25 percent of the servicemen, 30 of the males of military age in the Union states were foreign-born. Despite the fighting reputation of the Irish Brigade, the Irish were the most underrepresented group in proportion to population, followed by German Catholics. Other immigrant groups enlisted in rough proportion to their share of the population.\"  McPherson notes that those who enlisted or were drafted into the Union army tended to be disproportionately Protestant and skilled laborers or farmers, not working class Catholic immigrants. Which would make sense because especially in a place like New York City the latter groups tended to be extremely loyal to the Democratic Party and suspicious of a war effort largely run by Republicans such as Lincoln and Seward. Indeed, it was the Democratic Party that promoted the \"rich man's war, poor man's fight\" slogan in political debates over passing the 1863 Draft Bill (the passage of which led to the July 1863 Draft Riots in New York City, which are depicted in a historically distorted and whitewashed form in the film). For what it's worth, according to McPherson 98 percent of the men drafted in heavily Irish-immigrant districts ended up paying commutation fees or hired substitutes (mostly though Democratic political machine Tammany Hall funds).  That's some background. I slightly sidestepped the question as to whether the scene in the film actually happened. It seems like Scorsese is depicting the scene mostly as a metaphor for the myth mentioned above, ie, that immigrants \"fresh off the boat\" were signed up to serve in a meat grinder (hence the coffins being unloaded right next to the fresh volunteers), so I don't think the viewer is supposed to take the scene as the literal truth.  I've downplayed the role that Irish immigrants played relatively speaking in the Union army, but (as McPherson himself admits), there were notable exceptions, most notably the Irish Brigade, raised in New York by Capt. Thomas Francis Meagher and Corcoran's Legion formed by Colonel Michael Corcoran (both were Irish immigrants and connected to the Fenian movement).   It looks like the recruiting scene is a reference to recruiters outside Castle Clinton: the National Parks Service said that recruiters were located here to recruit recent Irish immigrants, but they are vague as to if this was before the Civil War, or before.   However, Irish historian and archaeologist Damian Shiels (who wrote *The Irish in the American Civil War*) looked at the recruiting in this area and found a letter where the New York Commissioners for Emigration explicitly banned the New York County Volunteers Recruiting Committee from recruiting in Castle Garden (specifically because it would spread the idea that new immigrants were being duped into joining the Union Army, and the bad international press this could cause).   Shiels' takeaway is therefore:   >\"The more I investigate the Irish experience, the more apparent it is that the type of incident portrayed in Gangs of New York rarely, if ever, occurred. Far from being duped, it was much more likely that many of these men had travelled to the United States with the express intention of joining the military, in the hope of benefiting from the financial rewards available for doing so. This was the primary motivation for Irish enlistment in the Union Army from at least 1863 onwards. These men were not stupid- they came from a country where enlistment in the British Army for economic reasons was commonplace, and they came informed about the Civil War.\"  Sources:   James McPherson. *Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era*  National Park Service. \"Irish Soldiers in the Union Army\"  Damian Shiels. \"Gangs of New York: Recruiting the Irish 'Straight Off the Boat'\".

                "content": " The Middle ages (and the earliest Modern period that followed) was an era before uniforms as we understand them. Compared to say, the 18th century, there wasn\u2019t a standardized, color-coded way to tell friend from foe. Instead, there were a variety of kinds of battlefield identifications used in different times and places in the medieval era to identify individuals, groups within an army, and armies. Because I study the later Middle Ages, I will discuss the period from around 1250 through 1500 or so. I will leave it to others to discuss battlefield identification in the early and high middle ages.  Battlefield identification had always been an issue. In the 13th century, the introduction of closed-faced helms made personal identification on the battlefield and in the tournament even more difficult. While older scholarship mentions helms as the impetus for crests and heraldry, more recent work questions this -  schemes to identify knights existed prior to closed-faced helmets. That said, in the 13th century means of identification became much, much more common. In the late 12th and 13th century, two ways of identifying individual soldiers developed. The first was heraldric surcoats and shields - coloring the surcoat (the loose robe worn over the armour in the 13th and 14th centuries) and shield with specific colors in specific patterns to identify a particular man at arms. The systems of heraldry is much more complicated than this, and relates to the construction of the knight as a social identity in the 13th and 14th century, but the battlefield/tournament use is still important to remember. The second was the crest, a sculpted \u2018topper\u2019 for the helm generally made of parchment or leather. The design on this would often be somehow identifying, though it was not necessarily related to the user\u2019s heraldry. Finally, in the 14th and 15th centuries as plate armour developed armour itself was decorated in ways that were individualized (for those who could afford it). The Black Prince\u2019s Guantlets had gadlings (brass knuckles, basically) in the shape of a lion, one of the animals emblematic of the English monarchy. In the Early modern period, armour decoration became more developed - the armour of say, Otto Heinrich, Count Palatinate of the Rheine, was gold and black, to match his colors. Charles V had his armour decorated with the symbols of his domains - primarily Burgundy (and more specifically, the Low Countries, which he had inheritted from the Duchy of Burgundy). Such decorated armour would help identify its wearers to friends (so that they could rally to defend them) and foes (so that they would know to capture them alive).  The effect of this was that an individual man at arms could now be identified by those who knew his crest and heraldry or his armour - such as by people who knew him personally, people fighting next to him, or (as the system of heraldry developed) professional heralds. However, since they are individual identification neither crests nor heraldric colors helps identify which side someone is on unless you know which side he is on, indvidually. That said, heraldry and crests served another important role - when soldiers were captured for ransom, it allowed their easy identification. It also allowed for the identification of the dead after battle (assuming that the corpses had not already been stripped, as often happened).   A solution that we see in the 15th century is the introduction of livery coats to identify the men in a certain lord\u2019s retinue. This is most extensively used in England during the period of the Wars of the Roses. A livery coat was a garment provided by a lord to his retainers (contracted soldiers) as part of their contract of \u2018livery and maintenance\u2019 (along with pay, food and wine/beer). It would be in a specific color, that would not necessarily be related to the Lord\u2019s heraldric colors, and often bear a badge associated with the lord (again, not related to the lord\u2019s heraldry, necessarily). For example, Richard III\u2019s men wore a badge with a boar on it. Wearing livery allowed men to identify the fellow members of their retinue, but didn\u2019t necessarily identify which side every retinue was on.  EDIT: Tobias Capwell has also argued that the decoration on a number of late 15th century painted sallets like this one were painted as a form of 'unit identification' by groups of medium cavalryman fighting for the city of Nuremberg. Essentially a group would all have monster faces painted onto their helmets. The evidence is not conclusive, but the idea is evocative at the very least.  Finally, there were army identifiers. Famously, Henry V had the English Army at Agincourt wear the red cross of St George. Similarly, in the late 15th century the Duke of Burgundy had his soldiers wear a red st Andrew\u2019s cross to identify themselves. In [this illumination from a swiss chronicle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Schilling_murten_bern.jpg )you can see the soldiers of Burgundy wearing an \u2018x\u2019 shaped cross fighting swiss soldiers with a \u2018+\u2019 shaped cross, the cross of Switzerland. These army identifiers might be worn on a livery coat, or sewn onto the clothing, or displayed on armour in some way. However, note that the soldiers are not wearing anything resembling a \u2018uniform\u2019 - the cross is a modification to their existing clothing, not a uniform garment worn by everyone.  In the end, there was not a uniform (heh) way of identifying one side from the another on the medieval battlefield. Friendly fire incidents did occur - at the Battle of Barnet in 1471 some Lancastrians mistook their own reinforcements for Yorkists, throwing the Lancastrians into disarray as they fought each other. However it should be noted that Barnet was fought in the fog - unusually low visibility for a medieval battle (though Towton 10 years earlier was fought in a snowstorm). Indeed compared with the smoke of an early modern battlefield, visiblity on a medieval battlefield would be relatively clear (though this clarity would decrease as the 15th and 16th centuries progressed).   It is important to remember that the melee was not necessarily the normal shape of medieval combat. In infantry warfare especially, tight formations were the norm. As Christine de Pisan wrote in 1409 (as quoted in Keen\u2019s \u2018Medieval Warfare\u2019): \u2018Two great evils can follow from a disordered formation: one is that the enemies can more easily break into it; the other is that the formations may be so compressed that they cannot fight. Thus it is necessary to keep a formation in ranks, and tight and joined together like a wall.\u2019 In this case it would be obvious who your friends were (the man next to you) and who your enemies were (the guy in front of you trying to jab a pike into your face). Contemporary military historians do not necessarily think of pre-modern battles as bloodthirsty free-for-alls, but instead a series of attacks and counter-attacks that could at times seem quite furtive as each side sought to maintain their cohesion and exploit any weaknesses of the enemy. That said, there were times - when cavalry charged, when reinforcements arrived, or when a group of men fled, that things could get quite chaotic. Then a badge of your army or lord might help you...or it might not.

                "content": " This is a question of obvious contemporary political importance so I will endeavor to answer it cautiously and with respect to the emotions it no doubt raises.  The logic here is best found in some of the signatory nations\u2019 legal interpretations and internal Law of Armed Conflict manuals,neatly summarized by the Red Cross here. . The Dutch manual of 2005, for instance, tells us the following:  >Riot control agents such as tear gas may not be used as a method of warfare (Chemical Weapons Convention Article 1). Use as a means of maintaining order, including the control of internal unrest, is not prohibited. Military use must be distinguished from this. **This conceals the danger that the use of a relatively harmless chemical may unleash the use of some other, more lethal one by the adversary**...\\[M\\]ilitary use of a non-lethal weapon may pose the danger that the adversary perceives it as a forbidden means, which may induce the adversary to use other, more lethal means. One example is the use of tear gas, mentioned above.  Chemical weapons pose particular problems on the battlefield as weapons of mass destruction. In the case of tear gas and other riot control agents, which do not pose major concerns in terms of environmental persistence, excessive painfulness, persistence of pain after the victim is removed from exposure to the gas, and potential for permanent injury, the problem posed is one of *escalation.* Consider two armies locked in combat, let\u2019s call them Red and Blue. Each side is a signatory to the same chemical weapons treaties, each side has a robust no-first-use policy, but each side has a stockpile of lethal chemical weapons including nerve agents as a deterrent to the enemy\u2019s use of chemical weapons. Neither side adheres to the 1993 rule on riot agents. A low-level Blue commander, Major Indigo, is having a hell of a time getting a Red battalion off an important hill. Major Indigo requests permission to fire tear gas onto the hill to dislodge the Red forces. It\u2019s an important hill, taking it could turn the tide of battle, and so his boss Colonel Cyan authorizes it. Meanwhile, the Red forces under Major Crimson are taking no chances. They\u2019ve been sweating in their gas masks and chemical suits all day, just in case. The call comes down the line - *gas, gas, gas!* \\- and Red\u2019s soldiers hunker down nervously, safe but uneasy in their protective gear. None of them are exposed, so it\u2019s hard to tell immediately just *what* chemical they got hit with. Major Crimson calls *his* boss, General Ruby. General Ruby knows **one** thing: when weapons of mass destruction are in play, you *have to* maintain the credibility of your deterrence. Blue has to be shown immediately that use of chemical weapons will not go unpunished. With staff academy lectures on \u201cescalation dominance\u201d echoing in the back of his mind, General Ruby signs the paperwork authorizing a limited but punishing chemical weapon retaliation. Three short-ranged ballistic missiles loaded with nerve gas are fired at Blue\u2019s position. Colonel Cyan, Major Indigo and their subalterns die a horrific, gasping death. An hour later, as Blue\u2019s *own* bombers and missiles loaded with mustard and VX begin to launch, the battlefield lab analysis lands on General Ruby\u2019s desk. Just tear gas.  The above scenario seems perhaps melodramatic or overwrought, but it highlights the stakes involved with weapons of mass destruction and the *extreme* consequences of incomplete information. The presence of nonlethal chemical agents on the battlefield creates a risk far out of proportion to the actual severity of the weapons themselves.  As for sourcing, in addition to the link given above, my perspective on deterrence, escalation risks, and the consequences for uncautious behavior with WMDs is heavily informed by Larsen and Karchtner\u2019s *On Limited Nuclear War in the 21st Century* and the opinions on so-called \u201cbattlefield\u201d nuclear weapons expressed by Michael Kofman in several of his CSIS presentations. These both do not directly connect to chemical weapons, but many of the concepts of deterrence are similar across categories of WMD; there is simply more literature on nuclear weapons than chemical.  EDIT FOR SOURCING: Savoy, Sagan, and Wirtz\u2019s 2000 *Planning the Unthinkable: How New Powers Will Use Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Weapons* was also at the back of my mind when I was chewing on this question.  OBLIGATORY MORNING-AFTER EDIT: Folks, please stop giving me gold. I appreciate the gesture, but giving money to reddit is probably the least useful thing you could be doing with that money. There are a massive number of nonprofits that need that money *far* more than reddit does. Reddit has a profitable ad revenue stream, and more importantly, reddit has spent the last decade platforming and giving shelter to white supremacist groups.

                "content": " The short answer to your question is that, yes, there would have been real people with the names of heroes and gods, but no, they were not common.  The long answer is that Ancient Greek naming conventions are a complex and fascinating topic. On the one hand, there are no surviving sources that explain to us how or why the Greeks came up with names for their children. Ancient authors do not seem to have found this topic interesting enough to write about. On the other hand, Greek names form a tremendously large body of evidence - the Lexicon of Greek Personal Names claims to have published as many as 215,000 so far - and the fact that most names are composed of words with a direct meaning in Greek means that they present a unique window into the social world of Ancient Greece. Because of their components and their meaning, names can often tell us about people's place of origin, family ties, social status, cult practices, looks, and so on.   With the exception of some restrictions on the naming of slaves, there do not seem to have been any particular rules about what people could and could not be named. We might expect, for instance, that it was frowned upon to give your child the literal name of a god or goddess, but there's no evidence that the Greeks actually found it taboo. Admittedly the names of divinities, while becoming more popular after the 1st century AD, are rare enough in the Classical period (5th-4th centuries BC) that individual known cases have been extensively discussed by scholars. However, they are not altogether absent. There certainly *were* people named Artemis and Leto. This shows that there were no hard limitations to what a child could be named, but only conventions by which most names were chosen. The only names that genuinely don't seem to have been used at all were those of underworld gods (Persephone, Hades).  So what were the conventions they stuck to? One of the most powerful factors, especially among elite families, was the names of ancestors; some sons were named directly after their fathers (such as Perikles, son of the famous Perikles), while others were named after their grandfathers (like Kleisthenes, father of democracy, grandson of Kleisthenes the tyrant of Sikyon). Modern scholars are on pretty firm ground when they assume that people with similar names are related; often a name would \"run\" in just one family, sometimes for centuries. A related strong influence was the desire to express social status (again especially among the rich), which meant that many wealthy people would have names that contained words like *aristo-* (the best), *-archos* (leader), and especially mutations of the word *hippos* (horse). The latter is often regarded as a firm indicator of high status, since only the richest men in Greece would be able to afford to own horses, and horse-riding was the favourite pursuit of the leisure class. Famous examples include Perikles' father Xanthippos (\"yellow horse\"), the physician Hippokrates (\"horse power\"), and Philippos II of Macedon (\"horse lover\").  If there were no particular traditions binding new parents, they would be able to choose a name they liked. Endless possibilities are known. Particularly striking to us, though not necessarily the most common, are male and female names that contain a direct reference to warfare - Kallimachos (\"beautiful battle\"), Archestrate (\"army-leader\"), Nikomachos (\"victory in battle\"), Andromache (\"battle of men\"), Deinomache (\"terrible in battle\"). Other names are more straightforward, like Leon (\"lion\"), Kephalon (\"head\") or Melissa (\"honey\"). People were named after cities, mountains, and, very commonly, rivers; Aristotle complains about rare and ridiculous names like Hermokaikoxanthos, a pile-up of the names of 3 rivers. Generally, words like *kalos* (beauty), *stratos* (army), *agora* (marketplace), *demos/damos* (people), *-anax* (king) and old values like *bia* (strength) and *kratos* (power) occur often in what we might call \"posh\" Greek names. Names ending in *-kles* (Perikles, Themistokles, Damokles) refer to *kleos* (glory). The combinations of these words don't always make sense; what sort of a name is Isagoras (\"equal marketplace\") or Iphikrates (\"strong strength\")?     Interestingly, while the actual outright names of gods are extremely rare, by far the most common type of name in Ancient Greece was actually the *indirect* reference to a god or goddess. There were 2 ways to do this. First, the name of a god could be easily adapted into an adjective form, so as to become a name *derived* from a god rather than the god's name itself. Some of the most common were adaptations of Apollo (for example into Apollonios), Dionysos (Dionysios), Artemis (Artemisia) or Demeter (Demetrios); the latter is still in common use now, in its vowel-shifted form of Dimitri. One of the most famous examples of such a godlike name is Alexander the Great's companion Hephaistion (from Hephaistos). The second way to adapt divine names was to add words to them - most commonly *kleos* (glory),*-doros* or *-dotos* (gift, given). So we have authors like Diodoros (\"god-given\" - the reference is to Zeus), Apollodoros, Asklepiodotos; in the Roman era, when Eastern gods made their way into Greek lands, new names like Isidoros (gift of Isis) crop up. While it has proved impossible to say with categorical certainty that names are an indication of which gods were being worshipped in a given place, regional patterns are very clear in the evidence, and names derived from gods are at least a clear indication of which divinities were considered important. Perhaps the most touching are the few cases when parents who consulted the oracle on matters related to childbirth would name their child after the god who had advised them or after the place of the oracle.  Given all these factors and trends, it's perhaps easy to understand why the literal names of heroes were not commonly used as names, even if there were no strict rules or moral taboos against them. There wouldn't have been any family tradition to do so; there was no social credit in making pretentious references; since mythological figures were not always the recipients of cults, they wouldn't often have been credited for advice or protection in childbirth. It's possible that their names would have been regarded as old-fashioned or an ill omen, given the fates of most of them. According to the searchable part of the Lexicon, Ikaros is attested just 20 times; Narkissos a more respectable 74 times. I can't find a single person named Odysseus. Only the hero Iason has a famous \"real-life\" counterpart in the 4th-century Thessalian tyrant Iason of Pherai.  Source for most of this: R. Parker, 'Theophoric names and the history of Greek religion', in S. Hornblower/E. Matthews (eds.) *Greek Personal Names: Their Value as Evidence* (2000), 53-79"

In contrast to Catherine of Aragon, Anne was not raised with the assumption that she would someday be queen of England, and so no one bothered to teach her French or English, and because she was a Lutheran, Latin was out.  When she came to England, she had several interpreters with her. She did eventually learn English, but until that time, she and Henry spoke to each other through interpreters.   In a normal marriage situation, negotiations would take place while the prince/princess were children. Often, the girl would be sent to be raised in the court of her betrothed until they were old enough to be married. She would learn the language there.  This is what happened with Mary, Queen of Scots, although to be fair, had she stayed in Scotland her normal education would have included learning French since Scotland and France were ancient allies (the alliance being nicknamed \"The Auld Alliance\").  Even if this didn't happen, many of the European courts spoke French. When Juana of Castile married Philip the Handsome, Philip was from the court of Bergundy, so while he was the son of the Holy Roman Emperor, it was a French court. Juana was sister to Catherine of Aragon and had the same education, meaning she could speak French as well.  When Henry VI married Margaret of Anjou, she was again a French princess and could easily adapt to the French speaking English court.  Anne Boleyn would have learned French as part of her education and practiced it when she served Queen Claude of France as a maid of honor.  Primary source: The Six Wives of Henry VIII by Alison Weir"

                "content": " Classical chronology was never an exact science.   During the Classical period, infamously, almost every Greek city had its own dating system, just as it had its own calendar and laws. In Athens, for example, an official called the eponymous archon gave his name to the year. At Sparta, the year was named after one of the ephors. At Argos, the priestess of Hera had that honor. \r  The dizzying array of dating conventions created enormous headaches for ancient Greek historians, who had to either pick a single dating system, like the Athenian archon lists, or craft cumbersome synchronisms. It was possible, however, to build long-term chronologies. Perhaps the most famous example is the Parian Marble, an inscribed chronicle recording events from 1582 to 298 BC.\r  The best-known Greek attempt at a systematic chronology was the Olympiad system, pioneered by the historian Timaeus and systematized by the polymath Eratosthenes in the third century BC. This system dated events in relation to the Olympic Games, which had been held every four years since \u2013 by Eratosthenes\u2019 calculation \u2013 our 776 BC. An event that took place in 480 BC was thus in the year of the 75th Olympiad. The Olympiad system was useful for historians, but it never became standard like the modern AD/CE system \u2013 and it seems to have never been referenced in daily life.   Like the Greeks, the Romans typically dated years by annual magistrates \u2013 in their case, the two ordinary consuls, who took office \u2013 by the imperial era \u2013 on January 1. \rConsular dating remained standard throughout Roman history. Roman scholars, however, sometimes referenced what we call \u201cab urbe condita\u201d dates, counting the years since the foundation of Rome. There was never a definitive date (then as now, historians disagreed about such things), but most scholars thought that Rome had been founded around 750 BC. The date calculated by the polymath Varro, 753 BC, was the most widely accepted. \r   \r  Like the Olympiad system, however, dating from the foundation of Rome was a convention used more or less exclusively by historians.   In other words, there really wasn't a clear conception of \"antiquity\" in antiquity, since their conception of the past was less neatly defined than ours. (And our conception of the classical past, it should be noted, is exceptionally - perhaps overly - neat, conditioned by the AD system and by the Renaissance obsession with antiquity, both of which have shaped how we tend to teach ancient history.)  If there was a division in ancient conceptions of the past, it was marked by the Trojan War. Myth and history were never neatly disarticulated in the classical imagination, but the Trojan War marked the point of separation between a past that was (thought to be) known and a past that was acknowledged as all but unknown, save through the traditional narratives we call the myths. Most ancient authors seem to have believed that Hercules and Jason had indeed existed (whatever their thoughts about the received myths surrounding these heroes). But they imagined them, or at least tended to write about them, in different terms from such \"historical\" figures as Themistocles and Xerxes.  The antiquity of antiquity, in short, was the world of myth."

                "content": " First, this is well beyond \"history\", and deep into prehistory and paleoanthropology, so sources here are based on fossil and genetic evidence. Our understanding of human evolution is constantly... well, evolving. There are also lots of new finds and controversies surrounding the dating of fossils and the strata in which they are found. Likewise, many of the most useful techniques are still being developed- tracing the changes in our genome and the appearance of genes at certain points, and their movement through populations. So let's explore the evidence and then try to put together a possible picture!  Let's start with human speech, which may have played an important part in our own social evolution. Here, we can compare our own anatomy to those of our own cousins and see what precisely enables us to make the sounds we do, and see when those traits emerged in the fossil record.  Consider the ability to produce human vowel vocalizations. Hyoid bones provide the point of attachment for tongue muscles and are important for hominid vocalizations. We have found a few hyoid bones matching those of modern humans, but most are more recent than 70,000 years.  However, this can be hard to date much further back. A find of our possible-ancestor-but-maybe-cousin *Homo heidelbergensis* showed a more human-like hyoid. Other bones from Spain show human-like hyoids from nearly 530,000 years ago! While convergent evolution is possible, if the common ancestors of humans and Neanderthals shared this sort of trait, the ability to make human-like speech sounds may be much older. Neanderthal fossils from Kebara in Israel show a human-like hyoid that should have been capable of human-sounding speech.  In addition to hyoid bones, some research on the evolution of human vocalization has looked at the proportions of the vocal tract (the length of our mouth and pharynx). This shows that neanderthals as well as early humans should have been anatomically capable of speech.   In addition, we can model the hearing range of our ancestors. Skulls and ear bones are much more common than hyoid bones, and by comparison to the anatomy of modern humans and other primates, we can model the range of sounds their ears were meant to hear. Again, this points to a shift to being able to hear higher frequencies and consonants among the Homo genus, even before the emergence of modern humans.  Chomsky and others argue that human language appeared 70-100k years ago, while others argue for more recent evolution of 50k years ago. It is impossible to say for certain, but the fossil and genomic evidence indicates human-like speech and hearing was present quite early in hominid evolution, and by 70k years ago, there is no anatomical reason we couldn't have modern languages (this doesn't mean they definitely existed, though).  Now let's move on to lifestyle! We have found early hominid burials with ornaments, and those of Neanderthals as well. Just last year, a grave of a human child that was buried was found in a Kenyan cave, dated to around 78,000 years ago. The child was wrapped, positioned, and buried shortly after death. In Israel, 15 individuals were found with ocher-stained tools in a 100k-year-old grave, and it is possible they were ritually buried.   It is likely more ritual was added over time- while the dead *H. heidelbergensis* in Spain may have simply been bone-caching, there is much more widespread evidence for burials and ritual after 120k years ago, with much more complete evidence and rituals as we move closer to 60kya. While Neanderthal burials are controversial to some, burial and ritual seem to be relatively widespread among humans during your timeframe. In the above examples, intentional burial is often inferred from the positioning of the bodies (in Israel, for example, the placing of a hand on top of a deer skull and antlers across the neck) or presence of burial artifacts.  Next is nomadic lifestyles. This is harder still to guess at; alongside human bones, we find tools, animal bones showing evidence of fire and being butchered or cracked for marrow, and so on. However, from the lack of evidence regarding pastoralism, permanent dwellings, or agriculture, most of which would be necessary to a sedentary lifestyle, we can guess that most humans were more or less nomadic, in that they were usually on the move. This may not mean constant wandering; based on what we know of hunter-gatherer societies, they often moved with the herds, seasons, and other factors. We know that they hunted, and from their teeth and genetic adaptions, we know that they were hunter-gatherers who ate a broad variety of plants and animals. From the speed with which humans colonized the planet, it may be safe to assume humans quite readily explored and moved over long distances to new places. The timeline of human migration out of Africa, the number of waves, and so on is being adjusted, but by 70kya, our hypothetical modern human could have been living in a variety of different places or climates.  So, putting it all together:  A biologically modern human 70kya would have had a nomadic lifestyle, but it would likely have varied considerably depending on where they were, with relatively small local movements, seasonal migrations, or more long-distance movement. This is one of the hardest to pin down from fossil evidence. They would likely have been fully capable of human vocalizations, but we do not know how complex their vocal languages were. Burials and rituals existed.  Edit: /u/Perfect_Inflation_70 pointed out this paper discussing permanently settled communities of hunter-gathers that could have been quite large. In coastal areas with rich resources that were reliable, or other places with a year-round high density food supply, it is possible for groups to settle (or have very low mobility) without agriculture. Many tribes and groups contacted in the modern area have patterns like this, and it does make sense they existed the time period discussed; however, especially if they were coastal, it may be difficult to discover large middens filled with fish and shellfish given changes in the coastline. So it's a possibility, and an example of how new discoveries are constantly being made and timelines adjusted."

Below are the benefits from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) or CARES Act that could help you.  The information below has been updated to reflect additional   details we\u2019ve received.  H.R. 6201, also known as the Families First Coronavirus   Response Act (FFCRA), applies to employers with fewer than 500 employees and   covers the period from April 1 to December 31, 2020. (Have 500 or more   staff? You can stop reading, it doesn\u2019t apply to you.)  The larger FFCRA includes two pieces of leave-related   legislation, the Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act and the   Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act, and requires employers to provide two kinds of paid leave related to   COVID-19. Keep in mind a leave is paid to employees who cannot perform   their job duties and who are not working.  You must provide **80   hours of paid sick leave** for the following COVID-19   related reasons if the employee:  1. Is under a federal, state, or local quarantine or isolation   order 2. Has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine 3. Is experiencing symptoms and is seeking medical diagnosis 4. Is caring for an individual under a quarantine or isolation   order or caring for an individual who has been advised by a health care   provider to self-quarantine 5. Is caring for a child whose school or daycare is closed or   unavailable 6. Is experiencing any other similar condition specified by the   Secretary of Health and Human Services  You must also provide **an additional 10 weeks of pay** if the   employee is unable to work due to caring for a child under 18 years of age   whose school or daycare is closed or unavailable.  One employee may qualify for both types of leave. The   maximum pay, in this circumstance, is $12,000.  **Note**: Small employers with fewer than 50   employees can exempt themselves from the 10 additional weeks of family leave   if business viability is threatened. We don\u2019t know what \u201cviable\u201d is   defined as. For now, if you\u2019re going to go completely broke, it\u2019s safe   to say you can skip it. Threatened viability should be relatively easy   to prove later.  **The Math: Calculating Leave**  Overall, a person can qualify for **up to 12 weeks** of   paid leave across both kinds of leave covered. The leave calculations are   different depending on why the employee is on leave.  \u00b7 For leave reasons (1),   (2) or (3) above: It is paid at their regular rate up to $511 per day (for up   to 10 days) and is capped at $5,110  \u00b7 For leave reasons (4) or   (6): It is paid at 2/3 of their regular rate up to $200 per day (for up to 10   days) and is capped at $2,000  \u00b7 For leave reason (5): It   is paid at 2/3 their regular rate up to $200 per day and is capped at $12,000   \u2014 This includes 10 days of paid sick leave plus the 10 weeks of emergency   leave  \u00b7 If a person qualifies   for both types of leave, the amount paid is capped at $12,000  &#x200B;  Think of it from their side.

This guy never, never, never stops talking.  100% the minutes of 100% of the work days this man has words falling out of his mouth.  Every moment a lull comes up and I think we are about to have a few minutes of silence, boom, a new topic comes leaking from the other side of the room (where he sits, it's a small room).  I know if I go to HR what will happen, she will talk to him, he will make a big fucking deal in the office about it.  That's just who he is, no topic is off limits, no subject is taboo. It's so bad I've stopped buying new clothes, getting new haircuts, wearing new shoes, changing literally anything about myself because I know the second I walk through the door at work, this person will immediately bring to attention everything different about me and won't let it go for at least an hour.  I just don't understand how a human can be like this. That mostly comes from being about 60% introverted but still.    I don't know how to deal with someone this incredibly desperate for all the attention, every sliver of attention must be on him at all times. If someone else in the room is having a quiet conversation with another co-worker, this guy will pipe up from across the room and ask them what they're talking about or just straight up offer an opinion. I can barely take it anymore, it's so bad, everyday all I can think about is screaming at him to please shut the fuck up for 5 god damned minutes.  That's all I need to regain my sanity. Help me!! Is there a covert psychological attack I can put on this person, something he won't notice that will make him stop talking. Oh, he's talking right now as I write this.

The home manager and her always had a good relationship and during the start of the pandemic they really pulled together, my wife going well above her Job description and paid grade (being on call, working well abover her working week etc) these traits continued but things started to turn sour. Home manager started to pick on her and assistant manager, to the point where the assistant manager left after 15yrs service. My wife struggled, not sleeping, losing her spark whilst still pulling in extra hours/responsibility for the good of the home and residents. It was noted by HR eventually and they forced the manager to take 8 weeks off paid, with support from company paid therapy.   During this time, again my wife basically took on the responsibility of home manager. A new Assistant manager was hired, who isnt great but still learning the ropes. Working 10-11hr days, on call, disciplinary responsibility, hiring, working with local government were all taken up by my wife.   The home manager was then brought back on a phased return, a few days a week. This lasted 2 weeks and then she was back, nit picking, singling out my wife, complaining about her to other staff members. A conversation with HR was had and they agreed they she should be forced to continue her return to work. Again, my wife feels victimised. Shes not her self. Tears, depressed.   Can anyone give any advice? Can anything be done? She feels she cant speak to HR as theyll basically tell the home manager it wad her and it would sour relations. It has been noted in the past by former employees in leaving interviews that the home manger is bullying/poor people management\n\nAssistant:"

But it sounds to me like you are waiting for HR to magically realize your wife is suffering, but that won't happen unless she says something to them. What is the worst that will happen, her manager starts singling her out? Talking bad about her to other employees? That's already happening and it won't change on its own."

I just returned from a medical leave and have come into the office multiple times to try and get my work from home stuff squared away. I was supposed to start work back Monday. I went in to the office Monday morning, texted my manager asking her where everyone was and if I could get my work from home stuff, was told to go home and she would make me an appointment to get my stuff set up. I go in at the scheduled time which was for Wednesday. Wednesday, I am told an appointment was never scheduled after 45 minutes of waiting and was told I had to come back the next day. So I come back Thursday, wait another 30 minutes and I finally get my stuff however they made my appointment at the end of the day so I couldn\u2019t clock in for my shift. So today, Friday, I have all of my stuff set up and go to get connected to the WiFi and find out they disabled the WiFi capabilities on the computer after I was told it would be fine. I call my boss and let her know and she says I need to have a modem and Ethernet cord which I don\u2019t have a modem because my apartment complex supplies the WiFi and tell her I was told WiFi would work. So now she\u2019s calling her boss to see what to do. However she\u2019s telling me the company may not pay me even though it\u2019s not my fault that they fumbled multiple times.

Sure it's nice to have a president, chief nursing officer, and regional marketing director for references but it doesn't mean squat if your desired jobshas nothing to do with any of those roles that they come from. A chief nursing officer is a nurse gone high up in to management and they almost only deal with nursing so their recommendation won't have much meaning to anybody if you aren't going for a nursing role, and even then a current practicing nurse would be more weight than a C level nurse for nursing recommendations. The president, Their job is to look pretty for the hospital system and be the one to take all the heat for external factors of the hospital. Most VPs have more to do internally with the hospital than a president so again, not much bearing.  Regional marketing director, if you aren't going in to marketing, it isn't worth much"

It's to the point he is more work keeping as an employee than not because my other reports constantly fix his mistakes and cover for him when he is gone at doctor's appointments (says he has Doc appointments Monday mornings and Friday afternoons so he gets in at 12 or leaves at 12).

He was at the computer and started sweating, panicking, and breathing very heavily and called his wife to pick him up. Security came over and tried convincing him to go to the hospital to no avail. He is morbidly obese (needs a scooter) and I told him to take some time off to recover and de-stress (honestly I was afraid he was going to die of a heart attack and we work in a very stressful line of work with many late nights). FMLA was not brought up.  &#x200B;  \\*Employee's father passed away of Covid in mid November and he took a week off to manage the affairs. Told him he can use FMLA and take off much more than a week if he needed but he brushed it off.  &#x200B;  \\*2 weeks later he takes another week off to help his grieving mother. I fully support this and let him know he can take up to 12 weeks of FMLA to take care of her. He said no because he woulnd't be paid but I told him he has almost 350 hours of vacation in his bank he can use in tandem (max is 450 hours at the company).  &#x200B;  \\*Employee no-call-no-shows December 14th and 15th. He texed me saying he was in the hospital but it was not life-threatening and he will be at work on the 21st. I reminded him he has FLMA and it will protect him but he said no, he wants to use his vacation time instead. He does not show up on the 21st and said he was still in the hospital. He no longer responds to texts or calls and I have no idea if 1) he will show up on Monday 2) he is lying 3) he is alive.  &#x200B;  At what point do I involve HR? I feel kinda like a jerk because his dad just died and he has is own health problems, and has been at the company about 25 years but at the same time my team cannot keep supporting him when he's so unreliable (he's had attendance issues in the past according to previous managers).  &#x200B;  Do I just....keep letting him burn his vacation time?

US(Michigan) First, can I ask if this is the incorrect sub to ask this question, please direct me to a more appropriate one.  So as the title says, we recently received a company wide email (about 450 employees across the eastern/midwest US) that the time between Christmas and New Years the offices will be closed and employees will be asked to use PTO those days.  This is in order to achieve a better \"work life balance\".  This policy starts in 2020.  We typically get Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and New Years Day off as paid holidays.    This email caused widespread grumbling and complaints.  I happened to be working in our HQ that day and talked to a some supervisors and the CEO about it.  The supervisors were surprised by the email as well and didn't really seem to buy into it.  The CEO however mentioned that most people take that time off anyways and productivity/utilization is very low. (aka the real reason this is happening)  Two things: I'm part of a young professionals group (YPG) at work, and for staff with less than 5 years at the company this is about a third of their yearly PTO (includes sick time).  So these two facts combines causes it to disproportionately affect the younger staff.    I guess this is fine if you're a traditional christian family who has kids out of school that week.  But what about the rest of us?  The area I'm in has many Muslim families so what are they supposed to do.  I don't really see how this is anything other than a reduction in benefits.  I'd like to create a questionnaire to ask the YPG how they are feeling about this and how it would affect them, their team, etc.  Although most staff is upset, this group already has set 'members'.  Do you have any ideas for questions?  Or is there a better way to go about this?\n\nAssistant:"

It requires accumulation of sick leave PTO up to 40 hours. That couldn't be used in the manner you're describing. So how are they separating out sick leave versus non-sick leave?  Note that they can close the offices for those two weeks and not pay anyone anything, and then later deny all PTO requests (that aren't sick-leave related). So I'm not sure what benefit any employee derives from not being paid for those two weeks. Since under this plan you get 2 weeks of pay versus perhaps 0 weeks of pay.  > I'd like to create a questionnaire to ask the YPG how they are feeling about this and how it would affect them, their team, etc.  If you were fired for this you would have a solid complaint to make with the NLRB, but it's a pointless survey."

I work at a nonprofit organization in Texas doing fundraising and donor relationship management among other things. We don't really have a HR department. I'm new to the field, and it's kind of a dream job (or at least a step on the way to a better dream job), so I am not sure how to deal with some things and have probably made a few missteps that have led me to where I am. Regardless, I'd like some advice on how to deal with this without quitting or burning bridges.  I started at a musuem last year and was introduced to a man in his 80s who donates a fair amount of folk art to the museum. Nothing ground-breaking, but he's been doing this for quite a while and has developed a relationship with the org and a friendship with our founding director. When I started, I just thought he was a friendly but crass old man who was maybe a little touchy or that there was a generational gap in understandings of professionalism/appropriateness. I would receive the occasional \"Forwards from Grandpa\" type email with a dirty joke every once in a while, but the relationship quickly crossed a physical line, ie grabbing my hand and holding me uncomfortably close during a handshake, too much touching on my back, comments on my figure or how my clothes fit (I like to keep in shape and am typically well-dressed at work), to a strange amount of him giving me things like old clothes, folk art, or magazines, which I would usually just accept graciously but throw away or donate to Goodwill once he left. I was uncomfortable about it but I also know I can be a very reserved and private person and wanted to be optimistic about it, as it is my job to keep donors happy.   Around Christmas, he invited me to stay at his apartment while he was away, and I tried to politely decline, and he asked if my email was monitored, which I ignored. At a opening reception, he got drunk and openly admitted to me that he knows exactly what he's doing in harassing me, knows that I hate and am made uncomfortable by his comments and actions, and mentioned that he loves to flirt with me simply because he can. this really upset me because my suspicions that he uses his status and \"nice old man\" persona to be a predator. When I had enough and mentioned this to some of the senior employees they basically said \"it's ____, what do you expect? I'm just glad he's not focusing on me any longer\" and discouraged me from bringing it up to our director. I'm not sure if the director is aware of it but I'm also not sure how they wouldn't be at this point. There have been other creepy things he's done since but you get the picture.   What should I do? I've tried keeping a professional arm's length since, or introducing him to my girlfriend but it's just getting worse. I don't want to damage the relationship the org has with him because it's my job to preserve these kinds of giving relationships but I'm kind of at my wit's end with the creepiness and intentional harassment. I figured initially I'd just put up with it until Father Time took care of business but I'd rather stand up for myself at this point.  TL;DR: friendly old donor at non-profit turns out to be creepy and i am not sure how to handle it professionally Location: Texas, USA.\n\nAssistant:"

The dress code for our company is business casual, which is the only description they give us. With that being said, I work with men who wear gym shorts and t-shirts, as well as baseball caps, everyday. Some of the older women I work with wear t-shirts and sweat-shorts, that go a tiny bit above their knee.   I am a younger woman, and I put a lot of thought into what I wear to work everyday. I have a hippy-boho style, so I wear a lot of longer skirts with a tank and cardigan. None of the skirts/dresses I wear to work go shorter than my knee and most of them don't come even close. On Friday, I wore a new white skirt (which went down to my ankles) and I checked before I left for work that you could not see my underwear. Unfortunately, Friday we had a fire-drill which resulted in 30 minutes of standing outside in the insanely bright sun. Because of that, someone must have noticed that in the bright sunlight, you could see my underwear.   When I was getting ready to leave work on Friday, my supervisor asked to speak to me. She explained that we had to have a discussion about something very personal and embarrassing, which automatically freaked me out. She explained how people were complaining about how you could see my underwear through my skirt, and how I have to dress more professionally at the workplace. She also mentioned that I supposedly wore a skirt earlier on this week that people thought were too short. She continued on about how I am a professional and have to dress like one, and how in my future career endeavors I have to be more mindful about what I wear. The way she worded some things made it seem like I was dressing to get attention from my co-workers and my clients that I work with.   There are a few reasons why I am offended by this. I'm honestly pretty upset that none of my co-workers mentioned it directly to me, as I've worked there for quite a while and feel like I am approachable with that sort of thing. I really wish people would know me better than to think I would intentionally show my underwear though my skirt for attention. I also work with an older woman who always wears white shirts in which you can see her bra underneath it - but she does not get spoken to about that. Quite frankly I also feel a bit discriminated against in regards to wearing short skirts as well. Like I said, a lot of women in the workplace (and men) wear shorts that are above their knees, and I never do.   I'm honestly just very frustrated and hurt by how I was confronted about this before I left work Friday. I get that my supervisor had to have a discussion with me if people complain, but now I just feel super judged at work and uncomfortable in my own skin. Trying to figure out an outfit for tomorrow was exhausting. I get that I am a very emotional person, but I also wanted some insight to see if I am being a little too sensitive about this. Thank you for reading and please let me know what your opinion is on this if you are able! I know my post is a bit of a tangent, but I've been anxious about it all weekend and am anxiously anticipating tomorrow as well :/\n\nAssistant:"

There are currently two technologists, and one developer. I am the senior technologist responsible for all training, not only of employees but also students and fellows, and the new tech (I'll call her Sara, not her real name) is is giving me an extremely difficult time. For background, I am a white 29f, she is mid 30sf and African American. I have been in my role for many years, she started 5 weeks ago.   I follow a very specific training method recommended by my employer, however Sara does not want to learn this way. I've made accomodations to allow her space and material to practice on her own rather than learn by direct observation, and so training is taking 10x as long as usual. I'm unable to make small requests that have a huge effect on workflow and patient impact without being met with major attitude or straight up refusal. She will gaslight me by saying I haven't shown or explained something when I definitely had multiple times, she just doesn't want to do the task.   After a specific instance that made me very frustrated because Sara absolutely refused to follow my instructions even after I thoroughly explained why it is critical. I told her it's a major problem if she's unable to follow the procedure and precedent, and she can take it up with the supervisor if she had an issue with the task. The three of us had a meeting that became quite heated, with her accusing my supervisor of taking my side when he tried to explain why the processes matter. We each had opportunities to voice our concerns, and when I was talking Sara started making faces, and I straight up asked her to please not do that since it's rude. She starts calling me names, telling me not to play the victim, and then when I'm clearly upset and irritated about this she pokes again asking me why I'm so mad. I responded by saying I'm not mad, I'm exasperated, and I am allowed to have human emotions. My boss asks us if we can come to some kind of middle ground, which of course we agree to but when asked by boss Sara only starts listing the ways I need to change, and is not willing to make any changes herself. The meeting devolved further and the supervisor is going to bring in his boss and HR to mediate a discussion next week.   However, now after this meeting Sara has made comments to our other coworker stating she will \"sue if this doesn't get resolved\" (I'm assuming her version of \"resolved\" is for things to go her way) and has already been filling out HR complaints. She's made a few comments to him about her race as well, but not directly to me. I'm worried that she will try to insinuate to HR that we are somehow discriminating against her. I know that I am not treating her any differently because of her race, and my issues only come from her resistance to learning and training.  I've been having open and honest discussions with my supervisor along the way to keep him updated about her training and some of the difficulties I'm having, and explaining the changes I've made to try to accommodate her preferences. I've started documenting exactly what I've shown her each day because of the gaslighting, but not her behavior or actions as I felt that would come across as singling her out.     How worried should I be about a discrimination accusation? Are there any proactive steps I can do to protect myself?\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": "\n\nHuman: [CA] Lied to about salary increase reasoning (exempt employee), should I discuss with HR? I have been with my current company since December 2019. In December 2021, I started on a new team within my department, but my title didn't change. Due to it being a lateral move (despite socially being considered a \"promotion\" to the top priority team in the company), I was told my salary wouldn't change. In January 2022, I received my first paycheck while on this team and noticed it was slightly more than usual, but I thought maybe it was due to the cost of living increases. In retrospect, I should have asked why I was making more in that moment.   Fast forward to March, 2 months into this \"new role\", we had our Annual Compensation Review (based on 2021 performance). The way this was explained to me \\[in 2019\\] was that each manager was allowed to give 3% raises to each person on their team based on merit. If someone got more than 3%, someone else got less. Last year, I got 5%, which I truly deserved after stepping up and filling my boss's role for over 6 months while she was on maternity leave. This year, they gave me 1%. Their rationale? \"You got a 3.9% raise in January when you joined the team, so you should be viewing this as almost 5%!\" I was extremely hurt and insulted, but I figured I was still making about 5% more than I was last year so that makes sense.   This past weekend, a friend mentioned she was considering leaving her company because she felt undervalued, even after she got the \"small bump in salary back in January due to it being legally mandatory in California\". I asked what she meant, and she told me that for exempt employees in California, the minimum salary was bumped up to $62,400. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GETTING PAID. Thanks to my super insulting 1% raise, I now make about $63,000. Since I know for a fact that everyone else at my level was given at least their 3% raise during the ACR period, I now realize that I am the lowest paid employee in our entire department.  I feel so disgusted by this realization. Not only am I extremely insulted by my salary as a whole, but now realizing that I was straight up lied to by management. I don't know how I can even bear to look anyone in the eye here or how I can ever do this job with any form of dignity again.  At this point, I want to know why I was given 1% during the ACR period. I re-read my entire 2021 performance review (which was done by my former manager) and there are zero negative remarks. Says I met all goals, led over 16 projects (someone at my level would normally lead maybe 1 or 2), named some of my big wins (which were truly HUGE), and how I am a huge asset to the company + my team. Why would my new manager be in charge of determining how much of  a raise I got for a year's worth of work I did on a different team? Is this something I should discuss with HR?\n\nAssistant:"

Then you start to realize that.. oh I can probably have the expectation that I may see a few percent increase by default every year and just ignore it because its trivial in the short term and adds up and creates some balance in the long term.  Another common one is \"I just started working here last month, I have been doing a great job and the hardest worker on the team!\" Only to realize that it is reasonable to assume you would not see a few percent economic, merit, whatever increase a month after you start working somewhere because the ones getting it have been there through the year and it was likely part of the budget.  I have had many years when I have told that I have the budget to give 5% to everyone across the board, years where you have to pick and choose, years where there is just enough for a few percent, etc.  Others in this thread have also provided some good feedback on this I see."

I was told my boss would have to speak to his boss. He then informed me that I was the greatest player on the team that deserved perks and proceeded to say: \"I am concerned for - I don't know how to put this delicately but given our relationship I think this is okay - your home life\". I have a few children. He said he did not know how I worked as hard as I did and he brings it up \"regularly\" to our female partner how it's amazing I can juggle so much considering. He said that he wants to see about reducing my schedule. I informed him I cannot go on a reduced schedule, as I cannot afford it, and he said \"well it's an option at least\".  I'm very familiar with being labeled a \"supermom\". This is not the first conversation where this has been expressed. What bothered me is that I asked my male teammate who is the same level as I am     and had his compensation conversation w/ the same person if our boss brought up his homelife. He has two babies under 2, whereas I have older kids (young teens).  My male teammate also asked if he could negotiate his raise and had a meeting scheduled with our boss and our boss' boss immediately.  I've never cried foul and I usually take these things with a grain of salt.

(humble brag) and I find it weird because during the screening phone call they asked my about my salary expectations and I said about 35% of my current salary, I am underpaid and based on the position I applied and experience that's the average salary in my area according to my research.

Would it be free will? No, it would be a totally random event and no will at all, whether free or not. When we talk about free will, we don't mean flipping a perfectly random coin (in fact, I would argue that indeterminism would be a serious blow to free will). When we talk about will, we talk about choosing something and acting upon that decision.

                "content": " >i.e. opposing forces interact and through a process of sublation create a synthesis.  Hegel didn't actually think this. This is a misconception about Hegel that has been widely circulated by people who did not have a strong understanding of his texts. That's why it's important to actually read Hegel if you want to understand him.  >how did history begin?  In a natural process, such as the evolution of an animal, different animals bring about changes over a long period of time through their various reproductive acts, but they do not bring about the evolution of the species \"consciously,\" nor does the way that they've existed in previous stages affect the way they behave in the future. **History**, for Hegel, happens when human beings not only act in a way that brings about changes over a period of time, but act in a way that is self-conscious of what has previously occured. So non-human animals have a natural \"history,\" but they are not aware of this history because non-human animals do not keep historical records, and thus cannot learn anything from history. History is when we are not just acting within time, but are acting within a history that we are capable of preserving for posterity and learning from.   That's Hegel's idea of history, and it started when human beings became conscious of themselves as historical agents.   **Dialectics**, by contrast, refers to the Hegelian methodology, which attempts to show how finite, one-sided determinations pass over into their opposites.   For example, the concept of \"Being\" seems simply enough, yet this concept is completely intedeterminate and adds nothing to a thing, and we find ourselves unable to answer the question \"What *is* being?\" Being, accordingly, is Nothing, the opposite of being.  Yet what *is* Nothing? When we ask this question, we treat \"nothing\" as if it exists, meaning that we turn \"nothing\" into \"being,\" its opposite. So \"nothing\" is the same as being.  The \"dialectic\" is this passing over of determinations into their opposites. When we ask \"What *is* Nothing?\", we treat nothing as if it were something that *is*, that is, as if it were Being. For the ancients, dialectic was used as a skeptical exercise, the point of which was supposed to show us that we cannot make sense of concepts like \"being\" and \"nothing.\" Plato, in fact, discusses a version of this paradox in the *Sophist*.   Kant, likewise, discusses a series of \"antinomies,\" contradictions that occur whenever we attempt to take concepts like \"cause/effect\" or \"part/whole\" and use reason to try to ask back as far as we can. For Kant, we can only avoid these antinomies if we apply our categories to *appearances*, rather than *things in-themselves*.  Unlike previous philosophers, who primarily see dialectic as a skeptical or sophistic exercise, one designed to either demonstrate the limits or reason or destroy another person's argument, Hegel claims that dialectic has a *positive result*.  For Hegel, what we see as a problem or skeptical challenge is itself the solution to what we think is a problem.   So like, for Hegel, the problem isn't that whenever we ask \"what is being?\" we are left with an empty indeterminacy, or that we can't ask \"what *is* nothing?\" without treating nothing like a being. Instead, this is itself the solution. Being and Nothing are finite determinations, and the truth of them is the movement of *Becoming*, which is this truth, namely: the unity of being and nothing.  Here, Hegel's example of a beginning is helpful for illustrating what he means by \"becoming.\" Think about the following paradox: Does something exist at the beginning? If it does, then it has already begun. If it does not, however, it has not yet begun. A sophist or skeptic might conclude, accordingly, that nothing can begin because beginnings are impossible. Yet this is just the same movement we have seen at work within the concepts of being and nothing. If the beginning is, then it is no longer a beginning because it has already begun. In terms of *negativity*, a beginning exists in such a way as to *sublate itself*, that is, cancel out the fact that it is a beginning and become something that has already begun. It exists through negative self-relation, that is, it exists by negating the fact that it exsits, begins by negating itself qua beginning.    The concept of a \"beginning\u201d is dialectical. Alternatively, we might say that beginnings relate to themselves *negatively*. This isn't just to say that they are the opposite of an ending (although we might observe that endings have a similar logical structure), but is the opposite of itself, because if it has begun, then it is no longer a beginning.   This self-referential negativity is the engine of the entire Hegelian system. It lets Hegel develop a system of all the categories of thought (starting with Being, Nothing, Becoming) through the inner logic of the concepts themselves, rather than by presupposing anything or drawing some form of external comparison.  To be a Hegelian, in my view, means that one has trained oneself to think in this dialectical manner, to recognize how each one-sided concept turns into its opposite, not by comparing it to the opposite or through some bogus synthesis, but by grasping how each determination inwardly contains its opposite moment.   So like, to give another kind of weirder example, yet one that I think is helpful, a finite way of understanding the creation of the world would be something like \"God is the cause and the world is the effect of creation.\" Yet to grasp things in a properly dialectical manner, one must figure out how the opposite is also true, that is, recognize that just as the cause produces the effect, the effect also produces the cause as cause, and is the \"cause\" of its being a cause. Accordingly, one would also have to conclude: Not only does God, as creator, create the world, the world also \"creates\" or \"posits\" God as a creator, that is, God cannot be a creator without the world, because the world makes God a creator.  Similarly, one might distinguish between cause and effect in terms of parent and child. The dialectical move is to recognize how each side is the same as its opposite, **not** because parents are also children of their own parents, but because just as the parent brings about the child at birth, the birth of the child brings about the parent *qua* parent, and the child is both the effect of the parent, yet also the cause of their becoming a parent, if that makes sense.  Learning to think in this way, by the way, can be especially useful for understanding the complicated and often contradictory world of human societies.   Applying it back to the topic of history, the dialectic at work within history is that human beings make history, yet are also made by history, that is, the historical events that have come before us shape us, yet they shape us in such a way that we can become self-conscious of how we have been shaped and use this knowledge to shape new events, which creates a kind of back-and-forth (that is, creates a dialectic) between the way events have shaped us, the way we understand these events to have shaped us, and the way we act in order to bring about new events.   **Spirit**: For Hegel, human beings are capable of self-consciousness, which means that we exist as both a conscious subject *and* as an object for consciousness. When we are self-conscious, the conscious subject and the object of consciousness, which are usually opposites, are unified. By \"spirit,\" Hegel understands, basically, this capacity for self-consciousness, of being both the subject and object, and also being capable of bringing together the various one-sided and finite moments (like being and nothing), which are fleeting and destroy themselves in the real world, yet can be brought together by the human mind through concepts.**  **Spirit is, of course, what enables the dialectic of history mentioned above."

(It is true that my memory informs me of the existence of many other objects; but what it tells me is only about their *past* existence, and neither it nor my senses tell me that those things have continued in existence until now.) So here I am, turning over these thoughts, when suddenly I hear a noise as of a door turning on its hinges, and a moment later I see a porter coming towards me.  This gives rise to many new reflections and reasonings in which three things predominate. \u2022 I have never observed that this kind of noise could come from anything but the motion of a door; so I conclude that the present phenomenon is a contradiction to all past experience unless the door that I remember on the other side of the room still exists. \u2022 I have always found that human bodies have a quality that I call \u2018gravity\u2019 which prevents them from floating in the air, which is what this porter must have done to arrive at my chamber unless the stairs that I remember have survived my absence from them. \u2022 I receive a letter which, when I open it, I see by the handwriting and signature to have come from a friend, and in it he says he is six hundred miles away.  Obviously I can\u2019t account for this phenomenon, consistently with my experience in other instances, without spreading out in my mind the whole sea and continent between us, and supposing the effects and continued existence of coaches and ferries, according to my memory and observation. Looked at in a certain way, these phenomena of the porter and letter are contradictions to common experience, and may be regarded as objections to the maxims we form about the connections of causes and effects.  I am accustomed to hearing a certain sound and at the same time seeing a certain object in motion. On this occasion I have received one of these impressions without the other. **These observations are contrary unless I suppose that the door still exists and that it was opened without my perceiving it; and this supposition, which at first was entirely arbitrary and hypothetical, becomes more strong and convincing through being the only one that lets me reconcile the contradiction.** At almost every moment of my life there is a similar instance presented to me, leading me to suppose the continued existence of objects in order to connect their past appearances with their present ones, giving them such a union with each other as I have found by experience to be suitable to their particular natures and circumstances. **Thus I am naturally led to regard the world as something real and durable, and as preserving its existence even when I don\u2019t perceive it.**"

A reduction of the question from the status of \"completely unexplainable enigma\" to \"a (pre)-historical curiosity\" - for all intent and purposes in this context - is the same as answering it.

That's often used as some kind of moral maxim, but I'm using it in a purely descriptive sense here. For vast majority of humanity over the vast majority of history, the only way to keep one's self from starving to death was to work. There may have been a fortunate few who were rich enough to avoid that, but not very many.   More philosophically, there are a variety of theories as to why work is important. Both virtue ethicists and Marxists would say that engaging in productive work is an important part of what it means to be human, though they generally have different ways of articulating that. For many moral theorists, there's an important connection between labor and property rights, meaning one who does not work won't have much of a claim to eat (the moral version of the aphorism above). For others, there's some sense of moral obligation to support one's self to the best of one's ability, so as not to be a burden upon one's family or society as a whole. Etc. Many if not most moral philosophers have considered work to be morally significant, even if there is quite a diversity of perspectives as to how that works itself out.   But you might be asking why so many of us seem to work jobs that we hate. That's a different question, and there are many different answers to that one too. Marx himself had a lot to say about exploitation and alienation, viewing capitalists' profiting from the labor of workers as immoral, oppressive, and exploitative. So there's a moral failure here, but it'd be mostly on the part of capitalists and/or the bourgeoisie. But even many philosophers more-or-less friendly to capitalism recognize a moral failure in choosing to work a job one despises for inadequate reasons. Say there's a man with a job that requires very long hours, to the point that his relationships and other pursuits really suffer. If that is the only job he could possibly do that would permit him to support himself and his family, that might be excusable. But if he could very easily work a different job that lets him *be a better person* while still meeting whatever obligations he might be said to have? That starts to look like a moral failing of one sort or another."

If the justness of a particular course of action - such as punishment or leniency, broadly conceived - is determined purely based on the consequences of a particular approach (rather than the intrinsic rightness or wrongness of actions or some other notion), then there's never going to be any principled way of ruling out the possibility that it could be morally permissible - or even morally obligatory - to punish innocent people, provided we were able to do the moral arithmetic and make the appropriate numbers add up.  The Rule Utilitarian might seek to respond by suggesting that to do so would undermine public trust in the institution of justice if they found out about it, and this would be very bad for society on the whole, so we ought to reject individual cases like this and stick with the rule. But we might simply stipulate for the purpose of this hypothetical that we were able to carry out this act in secret, or in such a way that no one will ever find out that the victim was actually innocent.  Eduardo Rivera-L\u00f3pez wrote an interesting paper titled *The moral murderer. A (more) effective counterexample to consequentialism* (2012) on a similar topic which I examined in one of my university papers recently. My lecturer and tutor Richard Yetter-Chappell (a Consequentialist, though I know from my discussions with him he's also sensitive to the concerns of virtue ethicists) has written a blog post attempting to reject Rivera-L\u00f3pez's argument here, and is also worth reading.  It also means that the Consequentialist view theoretically permits a framework of 'justice' in which criminals who commit morally atrocious acts might never suffer *any* punishment for doing so, instead being rehabilitated and then sent back out into the world, because to punish them might worsen the expected long-term consequences. It might be that if I get drunk and then drive my car into a group of school-children, ending a dozen innocent lives, that I never receive any punishment at all - after all, the only thing that matters is the consequences, and punishment might make me resentful or otherwise less likely to contribute to society in the future.

                "content": " Part 1/2]  It's a matter of debate.   Regardless, there are various reasons why someone might think consciousness is not emergent.     First let's be clear on our concepts. Those who think that consciousness is not emergent, are most likely to be thinking about *phenomenal consciousness* or the \"[qualitative character\" of consciousness. It feels like something to undergo an experience. Experiences are not *just* brute causal forces but they also have the nature of \"appearing\"/\"manifesting\" in some particular manner. This may not be how \"you\" define consciousness, nor how majority think is exclusively a matter of consciousness (consciousness is a pretty loaded term) but it seems to be an interesting aspect which is associated with consciousness - something philosophers (and scientists) are interested to focus on (i.e let's avoid semantics-dispute regarding whether having some experience with a qualitative character should be treated as  sufficient for \"consciousness\" or not).    Now, if we are thinking of this specific aspect of consciousness (i.e phenomenal consciousness or PC for short), several problems may seem to arise.   First we can question your initial point if by consciousness we are speaking of PC:   > what we define as \u201cconsciousness\u201d only arises in complex neural systems but not in individual neurons.    * We know (or atleast it appears to be the case) that we are complex neural systems that undergo phenomenal experiences (atleast one at a time, but perhaps multiple disunified experiences simultaneously). However that does not imply such forms of complexity are *necessary* for phenomenal experiences. Moreover, if we are thinking of consciousness in minimal terms as having phenomenal experiences, it doesn't logically follow that just having some forms (however weird or abstruse) of phenomenal experience would also mean having some particular class of competences and capacities (eg. intelligent behavior). That means, even if we treat intelligent behavior as a (possibly noisy) sign (controversial) for phenomenal consciousness, absence of intelligent behavior or competences may not count as an obvious sign for lack of phenomenal consciousness. Consider someone suffering from locked in syndrome.  Most likely they still have phenomenal consciousness, but severely limited capacities for behaviorial expressions.    * Think from another perspective. We find ourselves (as in developed humans) to be phenomenally conscious and we find, in ourselves, a particularly rich and structured form of consciousness associated with complex intelligent behaviors and competences. But should it mean only developed humans are conscious? Infants and babies probably don't have a well developed world-model for example, but still we reasonably think they still have qualitative experiences. Then how about other species like octupi, dolphins, ravens? They also display intelligent behavior. They are also part of the evolutionary process, and biological lifeforms with many relevant similaries. There doesn't seem to be a motivated reason to say they aren't having phenomenal consciousness. But then how about dogs, cats -- we tend to think they also have experiences (except people like Descartes perhaps?) -- as in they are not merely moved by causal forces, but also potentially undergoing experiences where things appear to them qualitatively. Then how about simpler organisms? What about rodents? earthworms? Many of them may not have higher-order metacognition or ability to \"reflect\" that they are a creature and they have consciousness. They may not survive mirror test and so on. But that doesn't mean they are lacking any and all traces of phenomenal consciousness as such.  But --- then where do we stop? If earthworms may have phenomenal consciousness, why not cells? They are organisms too, and behave in certain manner? Perhaps they undergo some extremely simple forms of experiences associated with environmental signals (perhpaps, hard to imagine but that doesn't mean we should discount it)? By extension it's not really clear if neurons don't have \"phenomenal consciousness\". Perhaps it's something like to be a neuron firing. We can go even more radical -- how do we know fundamental particles of physics do not have phenomenal consciousness? They also behave in certain regular manner and interact with an environment. Overall, it's not clear what is a \"motivated/principled\" manner of drawing the line -- such that before that line of complexity organisms/systems are supposed to be \"non-conscious\" and after that line \"conscious\". Complexity itself is a matter of degree.    * Note also that there isn't any clear behaviorial prediction made by having phenomenal-consciousness. Behaviors based on phenomenal consciousness can still be law-like, regular, and deterministic (for all we know our behaviors are such as well despite us having phenomenal consciousness). Some people can thus make a misguided move of \"bloating\" the notion of phenomenal consciousness with having some sort of self-model or some sort of \"non-deterministic will\" and then argue how that's falsified at some level. But we don't need to \"bloat\" the concept like that. In a way, the main reason for believing in the existence of phenomenal consciousness is simply that that's our lived experience (it's not some occult element -- if anything it's the least \"occult\" phenomena if phenomenality is considered in a bloat-free manner) rather than some specific behaviorial evidence.     So first thing to note here is that there isn't clear obvious motivated way to determine which system in which context is conscious. Proposed theories of phenomenal consciousness often tend to start with a myriad of assumptions which can be somewhat plausible but their truthfulness are not completely clear or obvious."

Because we're just plugging in normal predicates and objects and nouns or whatever, we're treating things like normal objects. The thing is, no one *really* thinks Kruger exists.  So the very concept of *existence* needs to be defined. Some authors think fictional characters exist in the same way as everything else (something like Alexius Meinong). Some authors ascribe a special existence, sometimes called \"subsistance,\" to fictional characters to say that they \"exist\" but in a different way (just in a non-real-world way). Other authors go even further and use special predicates like EVENT/ACTION (noun, object, FictionalUniverse), thus just adding in the world that the objects exist into the predicate.  We talk about fictional characters in nearly the same way we do as normal stuff, but we want also to differentiate their reality. How we do that largely depends on whether we make existence a predicate, or how our logic says things exist (if it does at all).  Compare the different translations  - F - M (k, n) - M (k, n, NightmareOnElmStreetFilm)  Here, we can see how different logics add in more detail to the formalization of the same sentence. With detail and structure, though, comes complexity. And when inventing logics, you want to make sure the complexity is worth the headache. And we haven't even considered predicate logical quantifiers of existence (\u2200 \"for all / universal\", \u2203 \"for some / existence\" ) or modal predicates about worlds, necessity, and contingency (\u22c4 \"possible\", \u25fb \"necessary\"). Take multiple logic courses at college or university. It's fun stuff.  These are very hairy issues in metaphysics and logic, but they're kinda cool.

So, for instance, Aristotle's extensive biological research is not relevant to contemporary biology, but his philosophy is still taken to be relevant. Ditto for Newton and physics; his limited writings on philosophy of science are still discussed today. Similarly, my understanding is that mathematics has moved on substantially from Hilbert, and logic has moved on substantially from Frege and Goedel, but their philosophical thoughts are still studied. So, it wouldn't be surprising if an extremely influential economist such as Marx was still relevant in philosophy long after his relevance to economics faded; that's par for the course for figures that contribute to multiple fields.  Second, putting aside how influence decays at different rates in different fields, it's also worth noting that \"being influenced by X\" will likely mean very different things in different fields. So, for example, if you're a political philosopher of sociologist, being influenced by Marx may mean simply that you begin from the assumption that economic factors tend to dominate over ideological ones---a thesis that is just as deserving of the term \"Marxist\" as something like the labor theory of value. Whereas in economics, being influenced by Marx means something very different (perhaps, for example, that you think the labor theory of value is correct). So it shouldn't surprise us that a thinker who wrote on as broad a range of subjects as Marx would have some areas in which he was relevant for longer than others.   Third, I expect there are at least some sociological factors at work here. Being identified as a Marxist usually won't cause you problems in sociology departments or with other sociologists. It often will among economists, who are among the more conservative academics. Similarly, at least in America, the influence of Keynes in economics (but not in fields such as sociology and philosophy) may explain why left-wing economics don't identify more with Marx; there's a more palatable giant of the field who can be associated with their commitments available, so there's no need to appeal to the more radical, problematic, and dated version."

Hey all,  For those with a formal education in philosophy:  I am an engineering student. I don\u2019t have the capacity to complete a full philosophy degree alongside my current studies but I want to be able to get a fullness of understanding of the fields and subfields of philosophy that interest me without the obligation of a formal education.   I am broadly interested in metaphysics, and more specifically ontology and noetic theory. Of course, I am aware that the foundational knowledge I need to engage with modern work on the subject is great.   As a layman, I would imagine the starting point would be something like studying classical works like Socrates and Plato, probably alongside a textbook.   What would you suggest as a path forward for someone who wants to be able to broadly engage with the modern field of metaphysics? Where do I start and where should I go from there? Should i also touch on some formal logic or epistemology to broaden my base?   Thanks in advance.\n\nAssistant:"

There\u2019s also Oxford\u2019s continuing Ed programs in philosophy - they\u2019re mostly weekly classes (Cam\u2019s tend to be done in weekend teaching blocks) and usually 10 credits a term (so 100 hours over 3 months ish).   Could also look at moocs on Edx and Coursera - most are free (without credits) and Coursera in particular has a good offering in regards to philosophy.   If you are committed to doing it entirely alone then yes, it\u2019s not a bad idea to get a copy of the Hackett complete works of Plato - and start there. I usually recommend using the history of philosophy without any gaps podcast - alongside reading through the dialogues.   For a specific interest in metaphysics some good books are:  *An Introduction to Metaphysics*  (2010) Carroll, John W. and Ned Markosian - Cambridge University Press  *Metaphysics: A guide and anthology* (2004) edited by Tim Crane and Katalin Farkas - Oxford University Press  *A Survey of Metaphysics* (2002) Lowe, E. J. Oxford University Press  *Metaphysics* (4th Ed. 2015) Van Inwagen, Peter - Westview Press  But remember the various branches of philosophy do not necessarily divide neatly - as much as some philosophers like to pretend they do. It\u2019s a walk before you run kinda thing - words can mean quite different and specific things in different parts of the discipline (especially in analytic philosophy/formal logic) - so it\u2019s useful to try and get a basic understanding of each area before you move onto more complex texts."

In it he claims that moral relativism (though I'm not sure exactly what specific form of it he refers to other than a general non-objective viewpoint) is an \"incoherent\" stance as opposed to simply a false one, comparing it to normal skepticism presumably a denial of objective reality. I'm not amazingly well-versed in ethics but I've very recently gotten into metaethics and nihilism and I'd like to understand these topics better as well as if the claim that moral relativism/nihilism/antirealism/whatever falls into the same trap as skepticism.

But Chomsky argues that there are biological bounds and constraints on that variation, i.e. that moral systems can't be whatever and that observation of *some* variation does not justify the inference that the possibility for variation is *infinite*.  Chomsky's argument is basically this:  1. Moral values reflect culture 2. Culture is acquired from limited observations of one's peers, i.e. a fairly limited amount data 3. All individuals make the leap from this fairly limited amount of data to a (more or less) coherent moral system 4. This leap is only possible if we have pre-existing cognitive structures, much like the universal grammar that Chomsky argues is a prerequisite for learning a language  Chomsky is a nativist, meaning that he argues for the innateness of certain aspects of our cognition. When he claims moral relativism is incoherent, he assumes one has to accept point 4 because without some innate structures the acquisition of culture becomes impossible. And if there are innate structures there are also constraints, meaning that the possible moral stances are finite. Hence strong moral relativism becomes an incoherent position. But it all hinges on the idea of some biological constraints on morality.  There are of course problems with nativism, which Chomsky doesn't really touch upon here. For example, he's not really making a good case for moral progress in the linked clip \u2013 he lists things that we now regard as unacceptable (i.e. oppression of women), but he doesn't really make the case for why this should be interpreted as us 'penetrating deeper into our real values' rather than moving further away from it. He argues that there has been a progression towards tolerance of variation and opposition to coercion, but there have arguably also been regressions (e.g. fascism, colonialism). And he doesn't discuss the fact that he could be accused of committing a naturalistic fallacy or appeal to nature."

For example, does the exterior world exist? Is the universe somehow conscious? Is it wrong to bring humans into existence? Entire libraries can be filled with the books and articles that have been written both for and against these question.   And yet, when one comes to vegetarianism, this appears no longer to be case. The literature surrounding vegetarianism appears, at least from a layman's point of view, very much one sided -- indeed, for a long time, I simply believed there was no good argument against vegetarianism. And it has only been by digging deep in the literature that I have found that, contrary to what I thought, there are good counter arguments to vegetarianism; the logic of the larder, for example; the argument that decreasing farm populations increases wild populations, and since wild animals can live worse lives than farm animals, vegetarianism actually increases animal suffering; or the arguments from philosophers like Callicott that vegetarianism/veganism is anti-ecological because by condemning animal pain and death as bad, logically it seems you need to condemn predation and intervene in wild nature; finally, I recently discovered the work of Plumwood who argues that vegetarianism/veganism enforces human chauvinism, as she explains:  \u201cAlthough, by definition, all ecologically embodied beings exist as food for some other beings, the human supremacist culture of the West makes a strong effort to deny human ecological embodiment by denying that we humans can be positioned in the food chain in the same way as other animals.\u201d   Now, I'm not here to ask whether these are good arguments (even though I think Plumwood's is) -- my question is more: why are philosophers seemingly shying away from criticising the ideas of Singer and co about vegetarianism?

You're definitely right that Lyotard's famous account of postmodernism as \"incredulity toward grand metanarratives\" would presumably be incompatible with Marxism as traditionally understood. That said, many philosophers usually labeled as postmodern are also political leftists. I think -- someone can correct me on this -- that this has more to do with the political situation in France in the latter part of the 20th century than with any philosophical connection with Marxism. Philosophy that gets labeled as postmodern is often French in origin (think Derrida, Foucault, Lyotard, etc.) and the political scene in France in the 50s/60s/70s is just more colored with Marxist influence than in other places. That's not very satisfying philosophically, but I think there is something there. That carries over into the academic scene in the US in the 80s/90s (more in literature departments, where these thinkers were appropriated more often than in philosophy).  Now, to Dennett's quote, which seems like it is the far more common sentiment regarding postmodernism. I hate to be uncharitable, but I think that the quote indicates the extent to which Anglo-American traditions of philosophy have often been uncharitable to continental traditions, and that \"postmodern\" sometimes is just a euphemism for \"continental philosophy we don't like.\"   As someone working in hermeneutics -- which takes as a starting place the idea that there are only interpretations -- I can tell you that interpretation and the idea that all truths are interpreted or arise out of a particular historical situation, etc. is NOT relativism in the sense that \"there is no truth\" or something like that. Dennett is simply working within a very specific understanding of what truth is and it excludes interpretation. To simply claim that the idea that truth involves interpretation is tantamount to denying truth and giving up the concepts of evidence and judgment is simply a strawman.  One more point about Peterson, and those who talk about \"cultural Marxism\" and SJWs as postmodern relativists. What I don't understand is that the whole idea of an SJW -- the stereotype that is thrown around on the right -- seems to involve an INTENSE commitment to morality. If anything, the criticism of stereotypical SJWs might be that they have too much moral certitude! The concept of social justice itself seems to exclude moral relativism."

Fisher doesn't think that the future is entirely dead, it still exists, it's just been momentarily suppressed by neoliberalism. Neoliberalism, in it's pure present, doesn't know genuine future but that doesn't mean that it has to be that way. Future Utopias are still possible. Which is why Hauntology is so important for him, it reminds us of genuine utopian futures that still await to be fulfilled.

I am also not in university right now so I am not in the mentality or time structure of rigorous study and I'm looking for a little motivation to buckle down.  I will explain where I'm coming from: I studied sociology in undergrad and was fascinated by classical soc theory (Marx, Weber, Durkheim), and I also thoroughly enjoyed the Frankfurt school and people like Foucault, Butler, Goffman, Mead, Simmel, etc. What I got out of reading these people was a new way of seeing myself and the people around me - the social/historical/psychological  forces that press upon us or that we interact with. Today, these ideas help me deal with the flow of my life, and to a lesser extent they also help me to direct my life in particular directions toward where I find fulfillment and contentedness. I like re-conceptualizing the things around me and I like re-configuring my ways of thinking.  Somewhere along my journey, the names I mentioned have called out to me. I have very limited understandings of their philosophies, and I would like to know how those of you who have read one or a couple or all of them have been affected by what you have read.

The radical changes in perspective I've had from these thinkers have seriously changed the way I think about everything - most obviously politics, but also relationships, my own behaviour etc. What always gets emphasised is conditionality, environment, differ\u00e9nce. Deleuze was a philosopher of *the event*. He's so affirmative, and joyful.   What's great about continental philosophy is that it isn't an individualistic or even humanistic set of theories. These sorts of thinkers offer interpretations that go far beyond the human or the individual. They force you to step back, see the forest for the trees and then move back in and let the trees know what their forest is like. It's all about relations, about condition.   Deleuze especially had massive political effect. The main difference between right and left, for me, to generalise, seems to be that those on the right hold the individual responsible for everything that happens to them, they affirm individual desire and will. Whilst the left sees an individual as an expression of the structure in which they're embedded, they affirm collective will to reconstruct the conditions which produce them.

Pretend I only know the words a mediocre high school student would.   I'm doing a Masters in biochemistry, trying to wrap my head around xray-crystallography and I've never even walked past a math lecture for actual math or physics students. I have never proven anything in my life. Mathematical terminology makes my brain shut down and I don't know how to fix that yet.   With that out of the way:   What is a fourier transform of space? In what conceptual way does that make any sense?   My understanding of the Fourier Transform is purely conceptual/functional, and its the usual time-frequency thing:   You have something changing over time. That change looks like a lot of coinciding waves. You apply the Fourier transform and you get the frequencies of the waves that constitute whatever thing you looked at. And with waves and time, the concept of frequency is pretty straightforward:   How often does a wave repeat itself within the span of a second?   The problem with this understanding is that the concept of the Fourier transform literally only makes sense to me when talking about time and waves.   What the fuck is the fourier transform of an image supposed to be?  Apparently that's a thing that exists but... what? Thinking of an image as composed of waves doesn't make sense to me, it's just a discrete color value at a discrete position. What would be the equivalent of time here? And what would its equivalence to a frequency even be? Like, how would I interprete it conceptually? Why does the fourier transform of an image meaningfully say anything?    And, more to the actual point: Diffraction patterns.   Supposedly, the diffraction pattern of a crystal is the Fourier Transform of it's electron density. So talking about it, it is claimed, is easier if we Fourier Transform the crystal lattice. So we do that and call it the reciprocal lattice. First: why is that? Of all the mathematical operations in the world, why does the diffraction process correspond to the Fourier Transform?   Second: How do I, conceptually and visually, make sense of the Fourier Transform of a fucking crystal lattice?   I assume the core of my problem is that I don't know what the Fourier Transform actually is, only what it does in the case of time-dependent stuff.   So, TL;DR: What is the fourier transform? Why does it make sense with things other than time and what does it say?  I'm grateful for any resources, although I already watched the 3b1b video on Fourier Transforms and it didn't help me with understanding what's going on on a conceptual level in crystallography.

And it's not even hard to see that. Obviously if you move a longer path the integral will be bigger. Also, if you move the same path once with constant speed and once with variable speed, the one with constant speed will have a smaller integral, as v is squared and big numbers squared become bigger faster, than small numbers squared become smaller.  So basically: Saying a path minimizes the kinetic energy functional is basically Newton's first law: Stuff left alone wants to move uniformly on a straight line. Now the - V enters. It allows the particle to deviate from its straight, constant velocity path.  Basically: Saying a path minimizes  int T-V dt  is saying that the particle wants to move as straight and as uniformly as possible, but sometimes, if there is a potential then taking a longer route and changing speed is actually more favorable. It is also clear that the \"deviation-maker\" has to be something connected to the potential energy.  Since we integrate over time, minimizing the action functional means we want to stay long (ie. move slow) where V is very big, and stay short (ie. move quick) where V is very small. And potential energy is exactly the function which has this effect, as we move slow if we trade kinetic energy for potential energy and vice versa.  Then of course thevquestion remains, why T-V and not T- 2/3 V or T-c^2 V or whatever, but I guess, the fine mathematical details really can only be seen by showing that the math works out."

The most likely effect it would cause would be seizures or headaches. However, the response of a brain is quite variable and wouldn't act exactly like a circuit.  ---  I did a study a while ago performing transcranial magnetic stimulation, where you *do* induce a current in someone's neurons to fire them. This allows you to among other things twitch a person's muscles using an EM field on the region of the scalp connected to the muscle in question.  However, it takes a rather strong magnetic field of about 2 Tesla, which is about as strong as an MRI magnet. Compare this with the strength of magnetic fields from household appliances or nearby power lines, which are all in the 100 nT\u2013100 \u00b5T range (LIPA - Magnetic Field Levels Around Homes) and at least 10 000 times too small.  But even still at this strength, the cortex (outer structures, involved with cognitive processing and movement coordination) of the brain is what is made to fire since the inner structures (involved with emotional functions) are kept insulated. So, you could potentially cause someone to have a seizure or headache but would be unlikely to (electrically) induce an emotional response. This fits with what you would see in the comparatively uncoordinated EM field used in electroconvulsive therapy.  It's also important to remember that neurology isn't electronics and it's quite an incomplete model to think of the brain as an electronic circuit of neurons. In many ways, the brain is far more adaptive, flexible, and durable. Similarly, a neuron is not made of solid metal with a sea of electrons carrying charge like a wire but is instead a bag of fluid within fluid enclosed by a membrane keeping potassium ions inside and sodium ions outside. The mechanism (the action potential, AP) a neuron uses to carry a current involves a change in shape of certain proteins triggered in a certain sequence, which allows the sodium and potassium ions to swap places. If an AP is properly induced, it reaches the tail end of the neuron and can trigger the next neuron in sequence to be fired via neurotransmission across the synapse. You would effectively need the effect to go across the synapse for it to have any relevance in more than just once neuron.  Inducing a *sufficiently strong* current allows this mechanism to occur. Otherwise, you won't get a full AP and no effect *between* cells. The neuron is able to effectively ignore small transient currents that aren't strong enough to induce an AP."

I hear this often, that string theory is not a particular theory but rather a framework for doing calculations. I have a few questions about this.  1) What does it actually mean for it to be a framework? Are there analogies to other areas of physics? Like, is this an ok analogy? \"The principle of least action (and principles like it in Hamiltonian mechanics) make up a framework since it allows us to do calculations (like finding the equations of motion given a Lagrangian/Hamiltonian) but doesn't tell us anything about the real world until we figure out the right Lagrangian/Hamiltonian to study.\"  2) What calculations are being done in this framework? For example, are they calculating scattering amplitudes of different processes or finding conserved quantities or something?  3) What can this framework do? Can it be used to make predictions? I hear that it is a sort of generalization of quantum field theory in that this string framework encompasses QFT. What does that mean? Can it reduce to QFT in the appropriate limit?  I apologize if these questions sort of miss the mark or the point. I'm trying to get a handle on what research is actually being done and how it relates to what I know other fields of research are doing.  Thanks!\n\nAssistant:"

There are many quantum field theories: they can include scalars, fermions, vectors, etc, they could have conformal symmetry (CFTs), they could have gauge symmetries (YM), they could have supersymmetry, they could be renormalizable or merely effective. You get the idea. QFT includes a 'framework' to compute things like scattering amplitudes and decay rates as are relevant for comparing with collider data.  'String theory' encompasses several different string theories (e.g. type IIB, heterotic, M-theory, etc.) which we have learned are all related to one another. Often there is a dimensionful 'string length' l\\_s, and when you take l\\_s to zero all the 'stringy' effects go away and you are back in the world of QFT."

It is this skin temperature that you actually feel. So the question becomes: How much does you skin temperature change when you touch wood and metal?  The rate at which your skin is cooled depends on the temperature difference between your skin and the surface of the object. Both objects start at room temperature, but their temperature increases due to the heat from your hand. And this is where the two materials differ. Metal is a good heat conductor, which means that heat will travel quickly through the material and heat the object uniformly. So the surface touching your hand will only heat up very slowly, causing a lot of heat to flow from your skin to the object, cooling down the skin.  Wood, on the other hand, is a heat insulator. Heat will only travel slowly through the material, which means that the far end of the object does not heat up at all. More heat remains located at the surface where your hand touches the object, increasing the local temperature and decreasing the heat flow. This means that your skin remains warmer when touching wood compared to metal, making the object feel warmer.  Note that in both cases I assumed the object is large compared to your hand. If you do it with small objects, like a paper clip, you will see that the effects I described are insignificant. The heat from your hand quickly heats up the object, no matter the material.

If you have something running in another cell and press undo it will replace that cell with a previous version, but the lines you just tabbed away? Gone forever.

You cannot edit or save your work and if you press either x, ok or cancel it will turn off Mathematica and you lose all unsaved work. There is an auto-save option, but its quite hidden and every time you update mathematica to a new version it will forget that you ever had it turned on. If you make a mistake somewhere and mathematica throws an error, instead of just stopping the calculation it will just continue running every next line of code leaving the previous expression as a symbol. Then instead of numerically inverting a 30x30 matrix it tries to it analytically, and in a bad case will run out of memory and crash. If you catch it in time you can abort the calculation. Except often the time spent to abort the calculation takes longer than killing the mathematica kernel and running the notebook from the start. When doing analytical computations you can ask mathematica to print equations in a pretty way. Instead of Sin\\[x\\] it will print sin(x) in a pretty font.

I'm doing a high-school depth study on the early history of quantum physics, and I'm currently working on how attempts to find a law for black body radiation by Wien, Rayleigh, and Planck led to the beginnings of quantum physics. I know that Rayleigh's 'law' is wrong because it relies on the equipartition theorem, but I was wondering why Wien's approximation is wrong, too? I've read through Wien's actual paper on the approximation and I can't quite tell what he does wrong.   And just to be clear, I'm talking about this law, not his displacement law:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien\\_approximation  Thank you in advance to anyone who answers!\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " It's actually pretty fascinating.  He used a completely classical treatment of light to get his approximation, but he got a fundamentally quantum result.    The Rayleigh-Jeans law you mentioned relies on equipartition in an infinite continuum, in which every possible wave mode is equally excited.  Since there are more wave modes at high frequencies (short wavelength) you find that there's more energy up there -- you get the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\"!!!    Wien's approximation is slightly more subtle.  He considered the thermodynamics of light using a similar treatment to how the ideal gas laws are derived.  In particular, in a perfectly reflective cavity electromagnetic waves act sort of like an ideal gas -- there is an electromagnetic thermal energy density and a pressure^[1] .  He considered how those things change under slow (\"adiabatic\") changes in the size of the cavity.  Expanding the cavity does two interesting things: it makes the light fainter, since it has the same total energy and has to fill more volume; and it also red-shifts it, from the accumulated Doppler shift off each bounce in the cavity as it expands.  These changes are analogous to what happens to an ideal gas:  expanding a tank of gas both makes the gas more tenuous (same number of molecules in the now-larger tank) and also cooler (because each particle loses energy when it bounces off the slowly moving wall).    Wien noticed that the two adiabatic changes in the light happen together: as the light gets fainter on average, it also gets redder on average.  He hypothesized that relationship should hold for each particular color of light in the distribution, not just for the distribution as a whole.  That hypothesis, together with the properties of thermal equilibrium between the light and a gas of emitting/absorbing molecules, yields the Wien Distribution Law.    That proportionality between wavelength shift and available energy in the mode is enough to produce the same general kind of mathematical effect that quantization does.  Wien didn't know about Planck's Constant, so it was an adjustable constant of the theory -- but his law works pretty damn well considering how much of a kluge it was.  The difference between Wien's Distribution Law and Planck's Law is really minor.  Wien got     I(\u03bb,T) = ( 2 h c^2 / \u03bb^5 ) / ( e^(K/\u03bbT) )  where the h and K are arbitrary constants that make the curve work. (and h happens to be Planck's Constant).  Planck's Law is very, very similar:    I(\u03bb,T) = (2 h c^2 / \u03bb^5 ) / ( e^(K/\u03bbT) - 1 )  where *this* K is numerically the same as Wien's K, but we now know that it's made out of other physical constants.  **So to answer your question** -- where Wien went \"wrong\" is that he made a hypothesis that didn't *quite* pan out.  It came pretty close -- it showed how to solve the \"UV catastrophe\" while also coming close to the real observed black body spectrum.  \u0397e identified a relationship between peak frequency of thermal radiation and the spectral brightness at that peak.  His ad hoc assumption was that the relation should hold for the entire spectrum, not just the peak.  That is: (1) enough, together with the Boltzmann distribution in thermal equilibrium, to get a distribution law; and (2) close enough to the actual E=hc/\u03bb relationship for photons, to get the spectrum right on the blue side.  But it isn't *quite* right (yet).  The hypothesis that *did* pan out came just a few years later (1905 compared to 1893).  Einstein pondered the weird photoelectric effect that, at the turn of the 20th Century, everyone knew didn't work at all the way classical electrodynamics predicts.  That was enough to get him thinking in terms of corpuscles instead of waves, and to muse about what that would do to the Rayleigh-Jeans law and its UV catastrophe.  His treatment (now echoed by graduate students the world over for 100 years) considers light sometimes as waves and sometimes as particles. That hybrid treatment fixes the distribution to match extremely precisely with experiment.  Incidentally, the difference between the Planck distribution and the Wien distribution is that persnickety \"-1\" in the denominator, which makes the denominator go to zero, instead of unity, at long wavelengths.  That effect turns out to be a real thing.   Considering the light field as a particle distribution instead of a collection of waves makes the Planck distribution into a new thermodynamic law -- the Bose-Einstein law.  The fact that the denominator goes to zero reflects a weird \"herd instinct\" property of some kinds of quantum particles -- which leads to nice things like lasers and superconductors and quantum superfluids.    ^[1] Those two things (energy density and pressure) have the same units and are actually sort of the same thing -- which is really cool if you hadn't noticed it already."

When I look up this question, the answer usually has something to do with Kepler's second law of planetary motion. While it is related to the question, that doesn't really satisfy me. I can understand that the orbit of a planet sweeps equal areas in equal times. To me, that just seems like the law of conservation of angular momentum in disguise.  The reason Kepler's laws don't satisfy me is because it describes what happens to a planet that is in an elliptical orbit, not how it got in that orbit.   In trying to answer this, I thought about the orbits of masses caught in the gravity of another, like a comet that was caught into an orbit around the sun. I can understand how something like that would have an elliptical orbit. The comment comes in with its own momentum and at an angle that isn't conducive to a circular orbit. It looks a lot like how when we purposefully do a gravity assist to apply a favorable acceleration to a spacecraft. Except this time, the gravity assist is not enough to achieve escape velocity, so the comet is stuck in this perpetual, gravity-assist like orbit. Hence, an elliptical orbit.   What about the planets? They formed from an accretion disk that also gave birth to the Sun. It has always been subjected to the forces of the Sun as long as the Sun has been a thing. The planets exist because of the Sun. They weren't caught in the orbit of the Sun. They came into existence in the Sun's gravity. What gave the planets their elliptical orbit?\n\nAssistant:"

But later on, once the gas and dust had cleared out, the gravitational tug from a near miss between protoplanets would kick them both into new elliptical orbits.

The amount and direction of eccentricity of each planet changes slowly over time due to the gravitational pull of other planets.

I am looking for information on the detectors used in these double slit experiments and their mechanics. I know there are many variations of the experiment, and they generally use polarized/non-polarized light, but I was unable to find any further information on them. I just do not see how this experiment led to quantum theory without investigating the interaction between the particles and the mechanics of the detector itself.  Wouldn't understanding how the detector interacts with the particles lead us to the causation of the effect in the experiment since the detector is the independent variable? Even using different detectors yield the same results, so wouldn't there be something in common in all detectors that causes this same result to occur?  I have emailed the physics department at my University to help explain this (they never got back to me) and I have been looking around online for answers but I am unable to find anything that I can understand when it comes to the particle detector used.\n\nAssistant:"

When gravity is coupled to quantum systems, things become even more difficult. Additional requirements are needed and the previous ones are usually changed to some degree. All of these goes under the name of swampland conjectures, because to hold them as true allows to distinguish between a theory that can be coupled to quantum gravity and one that can't (it's said it's in the swampland). So far only string theories and the low energy effective field theories coming from them have passed these consistency checks and it's conjectured that this is not a case.   Anyway an inconsistent theory sometimes can be useful, if you use it in a regime where its inconsistencies are not important. Like the Fermi model for weak interactions: we know it's just a non-renormalizable low energy approximation of the weak interaction in the SM, and it's also non-unitary, but it can be used if the energies in the process are not too high."

In short, instead of being based on bits which can be in either a '0' or a '1' state, quantum computers are based on quantum bits (or qubits) which are two-level quantum systems.  That quantum computers may be more powerful than classical computers can be appreciated by considering the problem of simulating a many-body quantum system -- say a system of N spin-1/2 particles in a fixed lattice (this is a simple model for magnetic materials). Each spin has two different orientations (let's call them 0 and 1 for obvious reasons), so if we only care about classical physics then the state of N spins can be represented by an N-digit binary string, and thus represented by N bits. But if this is a quantum system we have to allow for arbitrary superposition of configurations , which means instead of a bit-string of length N we need to store a vector of the amplitudes for each possible state, which means we need to store 2^N complex numbers. Thus, storing the state of a bunch of quantum spins requires exponentially more information than storing the state of a bunch of classical spins. But if you have access to a quantum computer, you can reverse this, and argue that a quantum computer consisting of N qubits encodes exponentially more information than a classical computer of N bits.  There are a handful of quantum algorithms that have been found that can solve certain problems faster than any classical computer (here by \"faster\" I'm specifically referring to how the number of operations necessary scales, e.g. whether it scales exponentially or polynomially). The most famous of these is Shor's algorithm, which can find the prime factors of an integer exponentially faster than the best classical algorithm.  The problem is current quantum computers are *severely* limited in terms of number of qubits and the number of operations you can apply to those qubits. The main problem is decoherence -- essentially, qubits tend to interact with their environment in way that causes them to lose their \"quantumness\". We can get around this using quantum error correction, but quantum error correction is really tricky. We can't use the same tricks we use in classical error correction because of things like the no-cloning theorem which tells us that we can't simply copy quantum data. Current quantum computers do *not* have error correction, and as such they are very limited in terms of the kinds of algorithms they can implement. In fact, it's not really clear if they can do anything a classical computer can't.  So why are they dangerous? Well, they aren't really. I suspect someone has been trying to hype them to you. Shor's algorithm for factoring integers breaks a lot of modern encryption, but we already have ways around that.  On the other hand, quantum computing offers huge benefits to the simulation of quantum systems (which will be handy for quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, and other many-body problems), and it may also help improve machine learning, combinatorial optimisation, and a bunch of other things (seriously, the field of quantum computing is *huge*). Of course, it's not likely to do any of these things any time soon.  Also, if you're really keen, you can actually play around with quantum computers yourself. If you're anything of a programmer, you should have a look at Qiskit, a Python-based software package developed by IBM that allows you to program and use real quantum computers. See also Cirq (Google's verison) and Pennylane. The documentation/tutorials for those packages are actually pretty good ways to learn about practical quantum computing.  **TL;DR** They work by exploiting quantum mechanics to solve certain problems more efficiently than classical computers can. They aren't dangerous."

The dot that shows on the moon will appear to travel faster than light, but the individual photons do not. Shadows could also fall under this category.  It also depends on what you consider speed. If you pick some distant galaxy and measure the speed it is moving away from us using most conventional methods, you will determine that it is receding. If you pick one that is far enough away, it will be receding faster than light, so it's weird how that light can still reach us, but it does. However, we can measure the average expansion of the universe and subtract that to find out that it is not moving *through* space faster than the speed of light. More that space is dragging it along with like the tide. More space is appearing between us, making it look that way.  For most physicists, a thing is a particle and speed is measured relative to nearby objects to minimize the effect of universe expansion. For that, massless particles are king. The 'speed of light' might be more accurately 'the speed of massless particles.' it's just that photons were the first one we found. Also, it is the speed of causality, gravitational waves, and information... Or rather, it is the max speed of these things. Just like light can be slowed down through certain media. That's also why we often say \"the speed of light in a vacuum.\" Cherenkov radiation are particles that can travel between the speed of light in water and the speed of light in a vacuum. Thus, in water, these particles can out-pace photons.  As for particles with mass, here on Earth, electrons have been brought to 104.5 GeV which clocked them at 99.9999999988% of the speed of light.

In other words, electric fields and magnetic fields transform from one to the other depending on your reference frame.  As for your \"how length contraction concerning protons and electrions cause a magnetic field to wrap around a current\", it's probably better to step back and see both sides of the situation before matching them with special relativity.  In general, magnetic fields curl around currents, and electric fields diverge from charges.  Furthermore, for changing fields, magnetic fields curl around changing electric fields, and electric fields curl around changing magnetic fields.  Lastly, magnetic fields must always loop on themselves, as a magnetic monopole (i.e., charge) has never been found.  Now, let's look at the Lorentz force for a moving charge near a neutral current carrying wire -- the charge deflects based on the magnetic force.  Now, if we were to transform to the moving charge frame, wherefrom the charge's perspective the wire is moving, the charge still accelerates away from the wire.  But why? The charge isn't moving to experience a magnetic force.  The only reason for the charge accelerate from rest is because of an electric force.  We see a similar result based on Faraday's experiement of a magnet passing through a coil: a passing coil experiences the lorentz (magnetic) force, but a passing magnet produces an electric field in the coil -- different forces produce the same end result.    Going back to our charge near a wire, the charge *must be experiencing an electric field since magnetic fields do no work on stationary charges*, and the only way for that electric field to arise is by a charge concentration -- the wire must not be charge neutral from the stationary charge perspective.  That's where special relativity comes in.  If we apply lorentz contraction due to the motion of the wire, we'd find that charges in the wire contract just enough to produce a differential in linear charge density, and it so happens to match the right amount of force that compares to the deflected moving charge due to only a magnetic field.   In short, it's not the contraction of the charges that \"cause a magnetic field to wrap\".  Magnetic field *always wraps around moving charges*, however, special relativity tells us that moving objects length contract depending on the frame of reference to generate an additional electric field component.  If we were to shift to the charge neutral wire (opposite charges contracting in equal amounts), then the only force acting from our perspective is magnetic.  Hope that helps.  Feynman does an interesting calculation showing this effect, but you said you want to say away from math."

                "content": " The reason for discrete energy levels is not the Pauli exclusion principle (PEP). That applies to a system of *many* electrons, but the discrete energy levels apply to a *single* electron. PEP explains why it is that the ground state for any atom other than Hydrogen involves the electrons occupying *different* energy levels, rather than all of them just sitting in the 1s orbital.  The reason for the discrete energy levels is the conjunction of the following three things:  1. The electron is not a point particle, as you find in classical mechanics, but a wave spread out through space, described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. 2. The positively charged nucleus creates an attractive potential (a ~1/r potential, in fact). 3. The potential is spherically symmetric.  From 1 and 3 it follows that the angular distribution of the electron wave can exist in one of only a discrete collection of states. (Imagine defining a wave on the sphere so that it's everywhere continuous and differentiable; you'll see that the compact form of the sphere means that the possible wavelengths of the wave are restricted to a discrete set.)   These different angular states are parametrised by the numbers \ud835\udcc1 and *m*, where \ud835\udcc1 is a natural number and *m* \u2208 {-\ud835\udcc1, -\ud835\udcc1 + 1, ..., \ud835\udcc1 - 1, \ud835\udcc1}. These are two of the quantum numbers. But note that to define *m* you have to choose some privileged direction. Unless that direction is picked out by the physics (e.g. an external magnetic field), it doesn't really matter which one you choose.  From 1, 2 and the above it follows that possible radial wavefunctions are also restricted to a discrete set. (Which discrete set depends on the value of \ud835\udcc1, but peculiarly not *m* -- this is because the potential takes a 1/r form.) The details here are technical; it essentially follows from the precise form of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The rough idea is that, if you expand the radial wavefunction as a power series, the fact that the wavefunction must be normalised, and so vanishing at spatial infinity, entails that the power series must terminate at some point. Where it terminates can be represented by a natural number. It follows that possible solutions form a discrete set, one for each value of this natural number.   So the different radial states, for each value of \ud835\udcc1, are parametrised by a natural number usually called *n*. But it turns out that *n* must be at least one more than \ud835\udcc1. This is the third quantum number.  Spin sort of gives the last quantum number: one usually writes *s*, which takes either -1/2 or 1/2 as values. But actually there are lots of choices for what *s* is (specifically, what *direction* we care to think about the particle as spinning in), completely analogous to the ambiguity in the definition of *m*.  So a complete set of quantum numbers, uniquely specifying a possible state, is (*n*, \ud835\udcc1, *m*, *s*).  *n* can be any natural number = 1 or larger. For each value of *n*, \ud835\udcc1 can by any natural number between 0 and n - 1; that gives *n* possibilities. For each value of \ud835\udcc1, *m* can be any integer from -\ud835\udcc1 to \ud835\udcc1; that gives 2\ud835\udcc1 + 1 possibilities. Finally, *s* can be -1/2 or 1/2; that's two possibilities. So for each value of *n* there are \u2211(\ud835\udcc1 running from 0 to n - 1) 2(2\ud835\udcc1 + 1) = 2n^(2) possible states. All the states with the same value of *n* are usually collectively called a \"shell\"."

This happens to be the frequency range (1-100GHz) in which I regularly work in, so hopefully I can offer some insight.   >Why do people only say that ionising radiation is dangerous/bad if being heated by microwaves is also \u201ebad\u201c (I know that it\u2018s safe to stay next to a microwave (the machine) but if you were directly targeted by microwaves (the EM radiation) it would heat you up right?)  I think it's because we understand why ionizing radiation is harmful. It breaks bonds in your DNA, which can lead to deleterious mutations if repaired incorrectly. On the flip side, there's not a clear mechanism for non-ionizing radiation to be harmful (unless it's in such huge powers that it significantly heats you up), and visible light clearly isn't harmful, so how could light that's even less energetic be bad for us?   That last bit, unfortunately, is an oversimplification that isn't firmly grounded in scientific fact. Here's a recent review of the grand total of just under 100 papers published about the biological effects of microwave radiation on various organisms: https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/18/3406/pdf It's a very easy read, and shows that many of the experiments resulted in some sort of change even if the microwave radiation wasn't powerful enough to cause any heating effects. While none of the studies show anything that means we should be worried about things like 5G, there's not actually enough evidence right now to preclude that possibility.    >Is there only one special frequency of EM radiation that heats up water and happens to be in the Microwave spectrum or could you do it with every frequency?  Not at all. You could do it with any frequency. The reason water heats up due to EM radiation is that it's a polar molecule, so it oscillates with the light's electric field. Much higher frequencies than the 2.45GHz used by microwaves wouldn't penetrate as well, so only the outside layer of the food would heat up. Much lower frequencies have weaker absorption and would require much more power for the same heating. 2.45GHz isn't even optimal, but was just a frequency that didn't interfere with ones that were already designated for other uses.  >And does every Molecule/Atom has its special frequency that brings it to vibrate? /Could you bring other molecules to vibrate too?  Absolutely. Each molecule and atom has resonant frequencies which they absorb especially well, but it's worth reiterating that this isn't how microwaves operate.   >What makes the inside of a microwave much stronger than the CMB Radiation? As they both are in the same frequency/wavelength right?  The microwave is specifically designed to produce light through a magnetron (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavity_magnetron), just like how a light bulb is designed to produce light at visible frequencies (although through a completely different method). The fact they're in the same frequency range as the CMB isn't really relevant as one is a piece of electronics actively designed to produce that radiation and can make as much/little of it as we want.   >Are there other known influences of EM Radiation on the human other than ionising and heating it up?  If you look back through the paper I linked (https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/18/3406/pdf), you'll see that in the microwaves, the effects on humans are basically unknown, but we do sometimes see non-thermal effects on other organisms that don't involve heating.   At the moment, there's insufficient evidence to say if any such effects exist for humans, (if they do exist) whether they're even harmful, and (if they are) whether 5G towers/devices produce enough radiation to reach those levels."

This is kinda a computer science/ physics question that i thought a bit about, and it has some cool implications, and i want to know if you can find any gaps in my logic that might make this untrue.  TL;DR; n particles cannot be used to simulate n+1 particles, and therefore you would need the amount of particles in the universe to simulate the universe.  In my opinion we will never be able to simulate the universe 100% accurately, i.e. simulate all interactions and quantum interactions of all particles at once. I came to this conclusion by thinking about a quantum computer that uses \"n\" particles for its processor, and which therefore can do 2\\^n operations at once. If this computer could simulate n+1 particle interactions 100% accurately, it would be able to simulate its own processor with 1 more particle for calculation, meaning the simulated computer can do 2\\^(n+1) operations. We just doubled our computing power. And we can keep this process going, getting the virtual computer to create an even larger virtual computer, and so on. We are effectively breaking entropy as we are keeping the same amount of real particles in the processor, while somehow increasing the amount of information those particles contain. Since this is totally illogical we can conclude that simulating \"n\" particles will require at least 2\\^n operations, which then breaks this paradox as we can now not simulate n+1 particles with our original quantum computer.  This also means that if we live in a simulation ourselves, that simulation must necessarily, at most, be an imperfect version of the simulators' own universe. Because if it wasn't, then the simulator would be creating a 100% accurate simulation of his own universe, which would then be our universe, where we could then also create 100% accurate universe simulations, which we have just shown that we couldn't.  &#x200B;  P.S. im new here so i dont really know if this is the proper format for reddit, or this sub-reddit, so im very sorry if it isn't.\n\nAssistant:"

First of all, all things will do a combination of reflect, transmit, absorb, and disperse when light is incident on them. The amount of each depends on a lot of properties.  Before getting into that, let's first address diffuse vs specular reflection. When a surface is rough, any light it reflects will be in random directions. Thus, light tends to spread out - reflections are not obvious, and the surface seems duller. This is not because it is less reflective, though, ~~per say~~ per se. Specular reflection is caused by smooth surfaces. When a smooth surface reflects, all of the rays typically follow the law of reflection, and remain collimated from their source. This allows you to see an image in the reflection, and thus the brain interprets this as more reflective.  All material interfaces produce some reflection. From an electrodynamics perspective, light is an electromagnetic wave. When the EM field of the wave interacts with the electrons in the material it is entering, it produces an oscillating polarization. This, in turn, radiates the electrodynamic wave backwards (reflection) and produces the known \"slowing\" of light as it transmits in the material. (A naive look at this would be to claim it is \"boundary conditions\" that produce the reflection, but that is just a mathematical approach rather than the underlying physics.)  The amount of reflection depends on a lot of different properties of the material:  - The more mobile the electrons on, are the more the EM wave interacts with them. Conductive materials have a very high reflectance as a result, since they have much more mobile electrons. This is why silvering is used on the back of mirrors (it is not the glass that produces the reflection, the glass is simply used to make it easy to produce a smooth surface for specular reflection).  - The higher the angle of incidence, relative to the normal to the surface, typically results in greater reflection. This is especially true if the index of refraction is lower in the transmitting material (hence total internal reflection).   - Resonances with the material can influence all 4 behaviours of light at an interface. To a first approximation, all binding states can be treated as simple harmonic oscillators - the electrons are bound to the nuclei, and if we disturb them slightly (as with an incoming EM field), then they will oscillate. If they are oscillated at a natural frequency, the energy of the incoming EM wave will be absorbed at a higher rate (and converted to internal forms of energy, or radiated dispersively - in all directions rather than reflected/transmitted directions).  If you have a grasp of the math involved in physics, check out Griffiths' Electrodynamics text. While not the most mathematically rigorous, or educationally helpful text, it does have decent descriptions and can help convince people that they understand (whether they do or not). Chapter 9 is all about electrodynamics waves.  Edit: I don't use the phrase \"per se\" very often. My misspelling of it shouldn't detract from the rest of what I have said. I am a physicist who has never taken Latin."

The brain dies off quickly, which is why humans die so rapidly, but that is because it has a *massive* oxygen demand that can't be turned off.  Other tissues like  kidney or lung have much lower oxygen needs in order not to degrade, and this is further helped by cooling the organ so even less maintenance is needed (as there is a lower rate of damage).  Organs like the heart or liver have a high oxygen demand, but that is because they are constantly active. If they stop functioning and are put on ice, the oxygen demand drastically falls again to just cell maintenance levels.  On top of this the organs that are transplanted also will have some ability to repair the damage done by ischemia in the recipient, which the brain lacks.  Finally is it worth noting that ischemic time of an organ that is transplanted is a major deciding factor in the outcome of the organ. Plenty of damage occurs and it is very important.  Edit: Sorry, I should have clarified this before; went I said the brain's oxygen demand can't be turned off I was alluding to neodiogenes's point - that the brain is unable to perform anaerobic metabolism. Certainly oxygen demand can be reduced by cold. As cold simply slows down chemical reactions it would be miraculous if it didn't reduce oxygen demand."

Waves can normally just propagate through whatever they're in, but sometimes a wave gets caught in a confined space, and gets stuck. An example is a vibration in a guitar string. Another example is an electron around a nucleus. Well, an electron isn't actually a wave, but it's a particle-that-acts-like-a-wave, and the analogy works.   Once a wave - like a plucked guitar string - is confined, there's only so many frequencies it can oscillate at. In music, we call them \"harmonics\". For an atom, we call them \"orbitals\" or \"wave functions\" or \"energy levels\", depending on whether you're a chemist or a quantum physicist or in between. A mathematician would call them \"eigenfunctions\", so we won't ask them for now.   If you have a string oscillating in a particular harmonic, you can sometimes snap the wave to a different harmonic by tapping the string in just the right place. Likewise, if you perturb an electron in an orbital, it can jump to a different orbital - a different pattern and geometry of vibration. This might require or release energy, since different orbitals have different \"energy levels\"."

Plant cell sizes can differ, but they lie between 10-100 micrometer. Under Leeuwenhoek s microscope a chloroplast should have had a size of around 0,5 mm - already visible, also due to their natural green color!  Big names here, notably,  Eduard Strasburger (born 1844) Andreas Schimper (born 1803) and Dmitri Sergejewitsch Mereschkowski (born 1865) already had a pretty good concept of the chloroplast and other cell compartments. They exposed cells under their microscope to different salts that made plant cells shrink or expand. Surprisingly, for example chloroplasts did not always shrink or expand proportionally to the rest of the cell. Hence, chloroplast must be more  protected or more vulnerable, respectively, against certain salt gradients. This was interpreted as an individual membrane system eventually, making them per definition a cell compartment  Unfortunately, I did find/or know the people who did such experiments in the first place and took the outcomes of the three guys listed above as good examples."

Ive gotten better at equalizing, and depend 100% on my gerbing electric heated socks, which i recharge and reuse every single day once the temperature drops below 50\u00b0  As for why i get flush from rain but not really cold... it seems to have to do with wetness/humidity/evaporation. Due to the nature of my spinal cord injury, I don't really sweat. A little in my armpits and a lot on my chest, but not on my head at all. Its bizarre and sucks. But again, if i'm in a humid environment, and especially when i'm wearing a hat, it seems to activate the sweating on my head.  In the summer my legs get very hot; my body cant seem to cool them. Though if i put them up (i.e. Lay down) their temperature quickly evens out. (In the summer, hot legs equalize in like 15 minutes when i lay down, whereas in the winter, cold legs take over an hour to equalize)"

Osmotic, permeability increased, secreting and abnormal motility (peristaltic)  * Osmotic, you have non absorbable substances that impides water to be absorbed and/or causes water to be transfered to the intestine.    * Artificial swetteners can cause this type of diarrhea (they can't be absorbed, that's why they don't have calories), as well as exocrine pancreatic insuficiency (can't digest fats, that draw water in). * Increased permeability, means that the intestine, instead of being a semiosmotic barrier as always, becomes more permeable in some way. This is the case in some inflamations and some circulatory diseases with high hidrostatic pressure and transudation.    * This is basically an edema. The body fighting the infection, increases the vascularity to the zone (more blood flows there), and with some mechanisms, allows electrolytes to go into the lumen. * Secreting. Normally, the intestine absorbs more (through the villi/mountains) than it secretes through the crypts/valleys (it has that shape in order to maximize absorption). If it doesn't, you are adding oil to a fire.    * Simple way, if an infection targets the crypts and makes them multiply and continue secreting, it will increase the amount of stuff in the intestine. Or, if it destroys the villi and doesn't absorb, but I guess that would be more akin to osmotic, although they are all conected. * Peristaltic, instead of having a slow digestion to process everything and absorb all, including water, in an infection your gut goes, \"there's something wrong, emergency evacuation\" floors the gas pedal, and you drop what you eat as a mishmash that couldn't have time to be absorbed.    * A day to day example is the difference between eating a lot of fruit \\[fiber and water and sugars\\] and red meat \\[proteins and hard to digest fats\\]. Also, this motility is the reason why bunnies eat their feces the first time the excrete them, because they can't digest them completely the first time around. (the more you know)    * (Aclaration: fiber is important for a good digestion. It was the most \"extreme normal example\" I could think of). Fiber attracts water and accelerates the digestion, being \"diarrhea-like\", whilst lots of fat, are hard to digest and slow digestion, being \"constipation-like\". Thus, eating only lettuce, would lead to a diarrhea like poop. Also, the peristaltic mechanism is often secondary to other processes.)  All of them can coexist, and in an inflammation, they usually do, but those are the mechanisms of diarrhea.  TLDR:  Specifically in regards to the virus, it probably will replicate in enterocytes (or some other intestinal cell depending on the virus). It will cause damage there, (decreasing the amount absorbed increasing osmotic pressure if it is in enterocytes \\[point 1\\]) and inflamation, increasing blood flow. This will increase the peristaltism \\[point 4\\]. In response to the infection, the immune system will respond secreting immunoglobulines and some other things point 3\\] and it will probably have some damage in the cells that will cause a \"leakage\" \\[point 2\\]. As there is more stuff in the lumen, that won't be absorbed (virus, inmunoglobulines...) there will be an increased osmotic pressure \\[point 1\\].  Edits:  1. Changed \"types\" for \"mechanisms\" it's more accurate. 2. Aclaration for the fiber part, didn't explain myself too well. 3. Some small changes to ortography and the like 4. Also. Wow, so many votes... And questions. Think I answered most if not all of them."

I'd like to challenge your notion of \"oneness.\" The brain, like the rest of the central nervous system, has two *nearly* identical hemispheres. The symmetric patterning of the brain and spine relies on similar cell migration/differentiation signals as other, doubled, organs. Calling the brain \"one\" organ but the retinas \"two\" organs is arbitrary, especially since they both developed from the same neural tube that creased itself \"hotdog style\" down the middle early in CNS development.  The heart can be thought of as a \"right heart\" and a \"left heart,\" both with an atrium and both with a ventricle. The left and right hearts don't directly share blood.  Cell migration and differentiation is the reason for all of the body's organization.   *Edit:* Some organs, like the pancreas and liver, start as \"two\" (or more) in development and merge together into \"one.\" Some organs, like the kidney and gonads, start out as two isolated buds. Whether they are considered by you and anatomists as \"one\" or \"two\" organs has more to do with structure and not on embryologic origin or actual function.  Edit 2: RE: evolution. A lot of you were really expecting an evolutionary argument, but I really don't think there is one here. Having two kidneys doesn't improve survivability or minimize energy expenditure. It's a well conserved trait of vertebrates, I think, simply because kidneys share the same developmental substrate (the mesonephros) as the gonads, and it wasn't disadvantageous enough of a trait to lose over time.   *Edit 3: removed discussion of the lungs for clarity and brevity*"

Delta is mainly a transmission-enhancing variant, and its immune-avoidance abilities are accidental consequences of changes to the spike that enhance transmission.   (The same has been true for the important previous variants, D614G and alpha -- they are primarily transmission enhancers with accidental immune avoidance. Beta and P.1, which have more immune evasion ability, have never taken off globally the way the transmission variants have, which is as you'd expect.)  So delta does have slight resistance to vaccine immunity, but it's not huge. It takes maybe five times as many antibodies to protect against delta than original strain.  A 5-fold difference sounds drastic, but it's really not. A 5-fold difference is about the limit of what you can actually measure meaningfully in antibodies, so you could say there's a barely detectable difference.  So what does this mean in terms of vaccination? Super simplified - You can think of immunity as giving progressively more protection, until it reaches a threshold over which it's just 100% protection no matter how much higher you get.  Let's say that threshold of protection for original strain is \"X\" antibodies. So the threshold of protection for delta is maybe \"5X\" antibodies. But vaccines start out giving most people maybe \"50X\" antibodies! Previous infection, on average, might give \"10X\" (the vaccines do better on average),   There's a lot of variation in the post-infection immunity (from say \"1/10X\" to \"500X\" and it's hard to judge where each individual is). There's some variation in vaccine response, but less because everyone gets the same vaccine dose (say, 10X to 100X with the average around 50X).   OK, so right after vaccination, most people are well protected against delta (10X-100X) and even better protected against original strain. After 6 months, say antibody levels drop by half. Now the average might be 25X, with the range from 5X to 50X. Now, the people at the low end are susceptible to delta, but resistant to original strain.   If you boost them, now the range might be 50X-500X. With this level of antibody, just about everyone should be resistant to delta -- not because of different immunity, but because the virus was always susceptible to the vaccine immunity and you just need to get it back over the threshold.   The most recent reference for this is probably Impact of Delta on viral burden and vaccine effectiveness against new SARS-CoV-2 infections in the UK (preprint, PDF link). There's an explainer for it, COVID vaccines protect against Delta, but their effectiveness wanes. Many other studies have found very similar results."

                "content": " Air pressure is part of the correct answer, but there is more to it and let me explain why.  It boils down to a few things (in no particular order):  1. Airspeed vs. Groundspeed 2. Weather 3. Traffic 4. Fuel efficiency  Firstly, an aircraft at 35,000 feet doesn't really care how fast it is moving with respect to the ground (groundspeed).  It does care how fast it is moving with respect to the medium through which it is flying (airspeed).  Generally speaking (this is simplified), the higher you are, the thinner the air is, and the faster you will move with respect to the ground for a given airspeed.  This is because with thinner air, you have fewer air molecules hitting the airplane for a given speed over the ground and thus you can travel faster over the ground before you run into structural issues with the aircraft.  For example, on a standard day (29.92 inHg barometric pressure, 15C/59F temperature) at sea level with no wind, if you're traveling at 250 kts through the air, you're traveling at 250 kts over the ground.  On that same day, with no wind, at 35,000 feet, at the same airspeed, you're travelling at in excess of 400 kts over the ground.  If you want me to expand in a further post about the difference between True Airspeed and Indicated Airspeed as well as Mach Number, Coffin Corner and why planes don't fly even higher, let me know and I will.  Second, flying higher gives you a few bonuses with regard to weather.  First, it makes it easier to take advantage of wind.  Generally speaking (and up to a limit), the higher you get, the stronger the winds are.  If you're rocking a 30 kt tailwind at 7,000 ft you might be able to pick up a 50 kt tailwind at 18,000 ft and a 100 kt tailwind at 35,000 ft.  A 100 kt tailwind component means you're going 100 kt faster over the ground.  Also, flying higher makes it easier to avoid nasty weather. While it's not at all uncommon for a thunderstorm to top out at 40,000 or even 50,000 feet being higher generally makes it easier to go over or around.  Also, once you get high enough you tend to be above significant cloud formations in the colder months, which reduces risks associated with ice buildup.  That and any visible moisture is more than likely frozen to begin with up high, which is a significant help.  Most transport category aircraft are reasonable at dealing with icing, but you still want to avoid it.  Third, the traffic element.  At least in the United States, when you get above about 10,000 feet you tend to leave most of the smaller traffic behind (and the speed limit increases from 250 kts to just shy of Mach 1).  Once you're flying above 18,000 feet, all aircraft are operating on an instrument flight plan under the guidance of air traffic control.  This has an added safety benefit in that center controllers are pretty good about keeping 2 planes operating IFR from occupying the same space at the same time.  Finally, there's a benefit in terms of fuel consumption.  I'm not a chemist.  If a chemist wants to step in and talk about stoichiometry they're more than welcome to do so, but in essence there is an optimal ratio of fuel to air for combustion.  So, as you get higher and the air gets less dense, for a given volume of air that is taken into an engine, less fuel is needed for combustion.  Fuel is expensive and airplanes burn a LOT of it so anything that results in less fuel consumption tends to be a good thing.  This all combines to make flying at a higher altitude a significantly better proposition than flying lower."

Source, Am nursery owner, work with trees/grafting regularly.  Edit: Both the xylem and phloem would be reconnected with a bridge graft as long as you line the scion up properly.    As a Nursery owner Ill throw my two cents in.   Yes it is possible, but unlikely if the two parts were simply balanced together. However there are grafting techniques which can reliably save the tree.   It is highly dependent on tree species, age, health, local weather, time of year, and a huge number of other factors. You would need the tree to be cut so thinly that there is zero diameter change between the two halves of the tree. This is nearly impossibly and is why wedge or vernier grafting exist.   You actually only need some of the vascular tissue (cambium, phloem, xylem) to be lined up for success. Obviously more is better but close to half is good enough for survival. There would be damage but the top would live.   That being said there is a technique which would greatly improve the chances of survival. You could bridge the gap. A bridge graft is where you take stems from younger trees of the same species and use them to connect the two separated pieces.   https://imgur.com/a/HNJBu  This can even be done in a way where the old wood from the original tree is removed so you have a large void instead of dead wood there. This technique is rarely practiced but is used to save heritage trees which have been damaged by rodents or mechanical damage usually from people mowing the lawn."

This is actually one of the most common questions I get from people when I tell them what I work on.   The key to containing such hot plasma is taking advantage of the fact plasma is composed of charged particles, so it can be shaped by a series of extremely powerful magnets to prevent it from contacting the inner walls of the machine. Needless to say, some plasma will still touch the walls, so an array of carefully engineered tiles made of special materials (typically tungsten alloys or certain composites) that can survive very short exposures to high heat fluxes are used to protect the other parts of the machine.   One of the most interesting parts of the armor design is a region called the \u2018divertor,\u2019 which essentially acts as an exhaust system for the plasma. In this region we intentionally smash the plasma into the armor. As you can imagine, this presents another layer of complexity to design and engineering. Check out one of the papers my colleagues published on our divertor system if you\u2019re curious about the more technical aspects.

To expand on the \"local conditions\" point mentioned in atomfullerene's excellent comment that is currently buried under a poor top comment, we're near the fresh water.  Distance from an average point on land to fresh water is, I can pretty confidently say, considerably less than the equivalent distance to salt water.  Salt water has an extremely limited distribution, *relative to land*; it is only found along the coasts.  The parts of the water out beyond the beach are effectively irrelevant for us land-dwellers.    Decided to do some math to get a sense of the scale here.  Total coastline, from Wikipedia: 356,000 kilometers.  It's the \"*World*\" measure right at the top.  The article goes into the uncertainty inherent in this measurement, but this is likely to be a reasonable estimate.  That's for a total world land area of 150,000,000 square kilometers.  Or, as the last column says, just over 2 meters of coastline per square kilometer.  Not a lot.    What about streams?  We'll use an example: New Hampshire, clocking in at 25,000 square kilometers, has roughly 25,000 kilometers of watercourse (PDF).  Nice symmetry, for one of the few decently cited data points I could find; I wasn't able to find any cited estimate for the United States as a whole, though I did see 3,660,000 miles of total watercourse mentioned repeatedly, and that's for 20,000 miles of coastline.  Not really necessary; New Hampshire gets the point across nicely.  It's one kilometer of watercourse per square kilometer.  That's two meters of coastline, one *kilometer* of stream/river.  And we're not even counting lakes.    To get into a more serious citation, for humans, 50% of us live less than 3km from a surface freshwater body."

As others in this thread have said the yield of a specific isotope in a supernova will be a function of things like the starting composition of the star, the distribution of that composition and the degree of mixing between layers in the star, the time dependent temperature and density profile of the star/supernova and the energy (and thus temperature) dependent cross sections of every possible nuclear reaction that can occur.  Stellar nucleosynthesis is typically modeled with network calculations that track the abundances of all possible isotopes. For example here is the network of isotopes and reactions relevant to big bang nucleosynthesis.^* Neutron capture, proton capture, alpha and beta decay transform the initial isotopic abundances to a new steady state that depends on the temperature and density. In a supernova where temperature and density change rapidly this gets even more complicated. Additionally photonuclear reactions like (gamma,n) and (gamma,p) may come into play.  Accurately modeling stellar nucleosynthesis is limited by uncertainties in the reaction cross sections, lack of knowledge about the mixing mechanisms that bring material from the core to the surface of a star (and vice-versa), and the ability to model the hydrodynamics of a star as it goes through the supernova process. These are all active areas of research.  If you're interested in learning more there is a nice white paper on the current state of nuclear astrophysics that has some information on the different network calculation codes available.   ^* Edit: For the sake of clarity I linked the simpler big bang reaction network. A supernova deals with significantly more neutron rich nuclei due to rapid neutron capture (the r-process). The reaction network would then have to model the blue regions in the chart of nuclides."

So determining the flow rate is not a trivial matter. What follows is a short paraphrasing of a relevant section of the paper.  Dimensional analysis can get you a rough relation for the flow rate. For simplicity, suppose our \"hourglass\" is a right circular cylinder filled with sand, which flows out through a small hole punched in the bottom of the cylinder. There are ostensibly (at least) 5 parameters that enter the flow rate: the diameter of the cylinder (*D*), the height of the sand (*H*), the diameter of the hole (*r*), the diameter of each grain (*a*), and the local gravitational acceleration (*g*).   It turns out that experimentally you can determine that if *H* is large compared to *D* and *r* is large compared to *a*, then the flow rate is independent of all our parameters except *r* and *g*. By dimensional analysis, the speed *v* of the grains as they exit the hole must be proportional to (*gr*)^(1/2). The flow rate is proportional to this speed times the cross-sectional area, hence proportional to *vr*^(2) ~ g^(1/2)r^(5/2).  The time it takes for an hourglass to empty is inverse proportional to the flow rate, hence proportional to g^(-1/2)r^(-5/2). So, for instance, if a certain hourglass measures time *T* on Earth, it will measure 6^(1/2)*T* on the Moon (because the Moon's gravity is about one-sixth that of Earth). Hence a 1-minute timer on Earth becomes about a 2.5-minute timer on the Moon.  **Summary:** Flow rate = Q ~ g^(1/2)r^(5/2), Total time = T ~ g^(-1/2)r^(-5/2)."

Ultimately it comes down to the power of your mind to synthesize multiple streams of information and create a conscious experience.   When you feel the sun, that\u2019s radiative heat warming the surface of your skin and turning to conductive heat. It travels a very short distance to warm nerve endings in your skin.   Although the sunlight instantly begins adding heat energy into your skin, you\u2019re not likely to feel it for a moment\u2014between a fraction of a second and a few seconds depending on how intense the sun is\u2014because it takes a moment for your skin\u2019s temperature to rise. The water in your body allows the heat to move fairly quickly. The heat-sensing nerve endings are very one-dimensional; all they detect is their own temperature rising. So I\u2019d say that ultimately what you feel is always conductive heat.   I don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely your body can sense the difference between radiative, conductive and convective heat without being aware of the context (the degree of heat, dryness, directionality, feeling air movement or lack thereof or being submerged in water etc will allow your brain to create a picture of what it is you\u2019re feeling).   Context can affect your perception dramatically which is why things like illusions are possible. These other sensory inputs can give you a very detailed understanding of what you\u2019re feeling, particularly if you\u2019re well accustomed to the experience. That understanding may or may not be accurate but it\u2019s all you have.   In brighter light you may also feel sensations in your skin as you begin to release sweat, and as your blood vessels dilate to transfer heat away. UV light exposure may also stimulate the release of histamine and other chemicals which can give you a prickly or tingly feeling, and release endorphins, which you can also feel in your whole body and they make you feel calm and euphoric.   And of course it can cause a burn.   As for the UV itself, you\u2019re unlikely to feel anything from the UV in sunlight\u2014people can get sunburned even in cold weather or underwater without feeling any heat. You also don\u2019t feel any difference in the warmth of sunlight if you\u2019re wearing sunscreen or the light is coming through UV-blocking glass.   Only a small proportion of the energy in sunlight comes in as damaging UV, but the photons are unfortunately so powerful that they can break some of the more delicate molecules they strike, including DNA, and some of the broken molecules become reactive and break other molecules or DNA. It\u2019s happening on the intra-cellular level so as it happens you can\u2019t feel it.   You don\u2019t feel a sunburn until your immune system senses the damaged cells and starts destroying them to lower your chance of cancer, and white blood cells will engulf and destroy cells that died on their own. Your blood vessels swell to help the white blood cells get in to the area, making your skin red. It\u2019s an inflammatory process, and for reasons that are not entirely understood, inflammation increases your pain sensitivity and can make you feel pain with even a light touch."

The way they did this was with the width of the lines, essentially how large a frequency range they're emitted over.  Measuring the width was easy, but the broadening of this line was immense - much higher than ever measured before.  Further, the thermal broadening of a line depends on the temperature and the ion mass, which meant that the line had temperatures in excess of a million Kelvin (nonsense!), or a mass less than hydrogen.    The scientists at the time announced their discovery: coronium, an element lighter than hydrogen!  Of course, they were wrong.

We conduct studies on human eating behavior, some of which include neuroscience components.  One of our research focuses involves integration of modern technologies. For example, in one of our experiments we have subjects eat a buffet style meal while wearing eye-tracking glasses. In another study, we use a Microsoft Surface tabletop computer to try to automatically detect and classify bites using the infrared camera behind the screen. We also use brain scans and perform non-invasive brain stimulation.    As humans, we don\u2019t eat nutrition, we simply eat. While there is a wealth of knowledge about what constitutes a healthy diet, we still need to better understand HOW people interact with food. Most of what we know about people\u2019s eating habits comes from self-report questionnaires and methods which are decades old. Given the state of technology in 2015, we think there is huge potential for improving the objective, quanitified methods available for studying eating behavior.  Thus, we are organizing Hacking Eating Tracking, a combination of symposium and hackathon, taking place at the Harvard Northwest Building, September 18-20th.  We\u2019re bringing together an exciting lineup of the leading scientists in the field who are also working on novel methodologies to speak about their research. They\u2019ll also present what they view as the most important challenges in the field, and our hackathon participants will attempt to apply their technological prowess to develop some solutions over the weekend.  If you\u2019re interested in participating, you can apply to the hackathon, or register as a general attendee] (http://www.hackingeatingtracking.org/tickets) to watch the talks and have the chance to interact with our speakers and hackers.  Ask us anything! We\u2019ll be back around 4-5PM EDT (20-21 UTC) after a meeting to answer your questions.  P.S. Some of our hackers have expressed interest in crowdsourcing a dataset to study. If you use a fitness tracker or a food logging app of some sort and are willing to submit some of your data to help them out, please [fill out this form with your email. We\u2019re still deciding how to best collect this sort of dataset, but we\u2019ll reach out once we\u2019ve figured it out.  -----  For those who want more background on why we\u2019re throwing Hacking Eating Tracking:  **The challenge:**  Eating is one of the most complex of human behaviors.  On a daily basis we eat:  * multiple times (breakfast, lunch, dinner) * different formats of food (liquids, solids, snacks, sandwiches or full meals) * in different locations and settings (home, work, on the go, at social occasions) * influenced by a long list of factors (appetite, taste, availability, price, convenience, familiarity, sociocultural norms, ethical views or religious rules)  **The context:**  Eating behavior can be studied at multiple levels:  * individual level, reducing it to its basic components (chewing, tasting, swallowing, bites, food selections) * group/population level (family, school, neighborhood, comminity or larger group).  We are interested in finding innovative methods and tools that can help quantify and objectively assess human eating behavior to tackle one, several or all of these components.   **Why is this important?**  Finding better ways to quantify eating behavior can make data more reliable, accurate, confident, and reproducible. These improvements can benefit many areas of scientific research. Additionally, they can be very valuable to enhance our capacity to evaluate and monitor the effects of interventions in medicine and public health.\n\nAssistant:"

One way to do this is to look at the dynamics of the Earth-Moon system. The center of mass of the pair is not the center of the Earth (though it is inside Earth), so the Earth \"wobbles\" around this center of mass as the Moon orbits it. You can find the position of this point by measuring the distance to the Moon at various points in its orbit, use this to find the ratio of Earth's mass to Moon mass, and then use that to figure out your orbital dynamics (and tell the engineers how strong to make the lander legs)."

Although newer studies would be much more reliable, here is a 1976 paper talking about the exact thing.   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1283673/  The abstract is a good summary. Pasting it here for a quick go-through.    1. The mechanical power spent to accelerate the limbs relative to the trunk in level walking and running,\u00a0\u1e86int, has been measured at various `constant' speeds (3-33 km/hr) with the cinematographic procedure used by Fenn (1930a) at high speeds of running.  2. The \u1e86int\u00a0increases approximately as the square of the speed of walking and running. For a given speed\u00a0\u1e86int\u00a0is greater in walking than in running.  3. In walking above 3 km/hr,\u00a0\u1e86int\u00a0is greater than the power spent to accelerate and lift the centre of mass of the body at each step,\u00a0\u1e86ext(measured by Cavagna, Thys & Zamboni, 1976b). In running\u00a0\u1e86int\u00a0<\u00a0\u1e86extup to about 20 km/hr, whereas at higher speeds\u00a0\u1e86int\u00a0>\u00a0\u1e86ext.  4. The total work done by the muscles was calculated as\u00a0Wtot\u00a0= \u01c0Wint\u01c0 + \u01c0Wext\u01c0. Except that at the highest speeds of walking, the total work done per unit distance\u00a0Wtot/km is greater in running than in walking.  5. The efficiency of positive work was measured from the ratio\u00a0Wtot/Net energy expenditure: this is greater than 0\u00b725 indicating that both in walking and in running the muscles utilize, during shortening, some energy stored during a previous phase of negative work (stretching).  6. In walking the efficiency reaches a maximum (0\u00b735-0\u00b740) at intermediate speeds, as may be expected from the properties of the contractile component of muscle. In running the efficiency increases steadily with speed (from 0\u00b745 to 0\u00b770-0\u00b780) suggesting that positive work derives mainly from the passive recoil of muscle elastic elements and to a lesser extent from the active shortening of the contractile machinery. These findings are consistent with the different mechanics of the two exercises."

Because fluids are difficult to compress, there's no appreciable change in density under high acceleration.

The practical acceleration protection limit via liquid immersion is hypothesized to be approximately 15-20 G's. Beyond that, cavities such as your lungs will collapse, so you'd need to fill your cavities with a human compatible oxygenated immersion fluid which simultaneously has a similar density to water. There is practical upper limit as the differential density of tissues inside the human body will eventually be reached, but hypothetically, if you filled a person with this fluid in all their cavities (lungs, stomach, intestines, etc.), they could survive outrageous amounts of acceleration. Of course, this is all contingent on finding an immersion fluid which is both lung-compatible and has a density similar to water, so it'll probably never happen."

As this shift happened, it's likely the only animals left alive were the few that were able to more efficiently use less light and absorb more radiation. Because of the mass extinction, this may have actually allowed the evolution of Kryptonians as there was less competition and fewer predators.  * Rao was an actual god and the entirety of Superman's story was planned out when Despair pitched to him the ultimate tragedy. He may have interfered with the development of Kryptonians so that he could provide the greatest story.  * Kryptonians were also genetically perfect as they were very scientifically inclined while simultaneously being religious zealots. This allowed them to make incredibly advanced technology despite their limited resources and being forbidden to leave. They modified their already incredibly efficient biology to unnatural levels to better thrive on their planet.  Essentially they turned themselves into the ultimate solar batteries that were ideal for red light radiation and very limited resources.

I'm assuming we are making Freddy invulnerable, so it's only the mass of the atmosphere that he would run into that's important.  Using Einstein's equation we find that he would only need to run into 0.0001623356g of material to give him enough energy. A hydrogen atom is apporximately 1.6605389e-24 g. So all he would need to run into in this near vacuum is 9.7760793e+19 hydrogen atoms.  Because this is basically a vacuum, there is nowhere for the heat to dissipate to.

The Muppets jumped into bed with the colonizers; their newfound edge in imported firepower plus their natural resistance to European diseases completely and irrevocably destroyed the balance between the human and puppet natives. Muppets would ride at the vanguard of every expansions, guiding the foreigners straight to the heart of their ancient enemies.   Of course, this doesn't mean that the Muppets held a unified front. Muppets fought on both sides of the major colonial conflicts; much of the Muppets population of London descends from Loyalist Muppets who fought alongside the British during the Revolutionary War, for instance. But with the Revolution, many Muppets became official American citizens, though they would never fully lose minority status. This led to issues during the urban growrlth of the 50s through 70s, as Muppets often fell victim to \"redlining\" practices, and neighborhoods with growing Muppet populations suffered issues from \"white flight\" and related problems. Through this, \"Muppet slums\" became something of a self-fulfilling prophecy, resulting in area's like Chicago's \"Felt Harlem\" and New York's \"Sesame Street\"."

He\u2019d get all four other Stones first if he could.  Even if he could beat them with what he had at that point, it\u2019s be a risk that Thor thought he was unlikely to take."

                "content": "\n\nHuman: [Multiverse] What other fictional properties' canonical multiverses, outside of DC and Marvel's, also establishes specific designations for each of their universes (whether it's numbered or whatever)? What I mean is, when a fictional TV show, movie, comics, games, books, etc. etc. (whether it's sci-fi, or fantasy) establishes more then one universes, then that's when a multiverse is established, right? And for each universes that are totally different from one another, they require specific designations (say universe 1, universe 2, universe 3, etc.) so that we the viewers, AND our heroes (or villains) will know exactly which this universe is which when talking about where this character is from, or where that device is from, etc.  The most famous example are DC and Marvel with their multiverse designating each of their realities by earth numbers, like DC's Earth-1 or Prime-Earth, and Marvel's Earth-616. Here's a list of few examples I got:  **DC**  * Earth-1 (Pre-Crisis) = Home of the Justice League of America (^(E-1 Superman, E-1 Batman, E-1 Wonder Woman, Flash Barry Allen), Green Lantern (Hal Jordon), Martian Manhunter, etc.)) * Earth-2 (Pre-Crisis) = Home of the Justice Society of America (^(E-2 Superman, E-2 Batman, E-2 Wonder Woman, Flash (Jay Garrick), Dr. Fate, Specter, Green Lantern (Alan Scott), Green Arrow, etc.)) * New-Earth = Home of the Justice League of the Silver Age, and the Justice Society of the Golden Age, Post Crisis * Earth-12 = DC Beyond (which is NOT the DC Animated Universe, BTW) * Earth-19 = Gotham by Gaslight * Earth-22 = Kingdom Come * Earth-30 = Superman: Red Son * Earth-31 = The Dark Knight Returns (and all of it's sequels, and ASBAR) * Earth-C/Earth-26 = Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! * etc.  **Marvel**  * Earth-616 = Marvel Universe * Earth-1610 = Ultimate Universe * Earth-199999 = Marvel Cinematic Universe * Earth-8096 = Wolverine and the X-Men/The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes * Earth-51778 = Japanese Spider-Man (1977) * Earth-13122 = LEGO Marvel Super Heroes * Earth-26496 = The Spectacular Spider-Man * Earth-30847 = Marvel vs. Capcom * etc.  But with other fictional properties with an established multiverses outside of DC and Marvel, they also tend to designate their realities specifically, but they do it more differently (sometimes even more complex then just \"Earth-1\" or whatever). Take for instance...  **Rick and Morty**  * Dimension C-137 = Former home of our Rick and Morty before it got \"Cronenberged\" * Dimension J19 Zeta 7 = Home of \"Doofus Rick\" * Dimension 35-C  = Where the Mega Seeds originated * Dimension 46'\\\\ = The Universe of Gravity Falls (believe it or not!) * etc.  **Ghostbusters**  * Prime Dimension = Ghostbusters (IDW canon) * Dimension 68-R = The Real Ghostbusters  * Dimension 68-E = Extreme Ghostbusters * Dimension 68-Q = Slimer! * Dimension 11-W = Ghostbusters: The Video Game (Stylized Version) * Dimension 80-C = Ghostbusters (2016) (^(A.K.A. Ghostbusters: Answer the Call)) * etc.  Hell, even...  **Transformers** (and brace yourselves for these ones!)  * Primax 984.17 Alpha = The Transformers (1984 - 1987) (^(including The Transformers: The Movie, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, Jem, Inhumanoids, and COPS)) * Primax 496.22 Alpha = Beast Wars/Beast Machines * Primax 984.0 Gamma = The Marvel US Transformers comics (^(including the G.I. Joe comics, the Generation 2 comics, and Simon Furman's fanfiction, Alignment \\[which IS canon, BTW\\])) * Primax 1005.119 Gamma = The 2005-2018 IDW Continuity (A.K.A. Hasbro Universe) * Viron 901.8 Alpha = Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2001) * Aurex 802.23 Alpha = The Transformers Armada, Energon, and Cybertron cartoons * Tyran 707.04 Delta = the live-action Transformers movies (^(Transformers, Revenge of the Fallen, Dark of the Moon, Age of Extinction, and The Last Knight)) * Malgus 1207.27 Alpha = Transformers Animated * Uniend 911.05 Alpha = Transformers Prime, Rescue Bots, and Robots in Disguise (2015) * G1 World (Primax 785.06 Alpha/OG World) = Fight! Super Robot Lifeform Transformers * Nexus 208.0 Epsilon = Axiom Nexus (TransTechs) * etc. (Sorry if Transformers multiverse's one was convoluted as hell, it's gonna take a lot to get use to, I guess. Also, why doesn't Reddit.com have an Underline feature? That would've been easy).  But yeah, you get the idea. These are the popular fictional franchises with multiverses that specifically designates each of their realities (both for viewers, and in-universe). But now **THIS** is where I ask for OTHER franchises, purely out of curiosity (and fascination, I guess): What about the the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles multiverse? What about He-Man's multiverse (as first established within DC comics in recent years, I dunno which issue)? Scooby-Doo's multiverse (first established in Scooby-Doo! Team-Up #100 - Crisis of Infinite Scooby's)? Star Trek? Doctor Who? Archie Comics? Gundam? Dragon Ball? Digimon? Ben 10? Power Rangers? ANY fictional properties with a canonical multiverse? Any ones besides them, even?  If the one's I'm asking for **do** have specific designated realities in each of these multiverses (IF they have an actual multiverse established in canon, rather then theorized by fans, mind you), like numbered or whatever, what're these universes called in canon, exactly? Please let me know.  Thank you in advance. :)\n\nAssistant:"

Further supported by the MCU's greater acceptance of gods as actual beings - the Wakandan religion is confirmed accurate, the Egyptian pantheon is confirmed to exist.   Thor, Odin, all of them are literal gods now not advanced aliens.   Hela was trapped in Hel. The Norse afterlife almost certainly does exist, bolstered by Taweret in Moon Knight confirming that there are many \"planes for untethered unconsciousness\" after Marc asks if the Egyptian afterlife is \"THE afterlife\".

How do they communicate? Or the senate for example, how do they operate efficiently? Is there like a central time that planets abide by? Eg: do planets agree to consider 24hours as one day, regardless of the rotation of the planet? What if someone on Planet X has to communicate with someone on Planet Y while time/days are different for both of them?

Each planet would use their own time for their internal business, but when you'd set your schedules with other planets you'd use CMT to make sure everyone's using the same time.   For travelers on ships, there's a few different ways they can do it. Either A) they can gently mess with the lights and timing during transit so by the time they arrive at their destination they're on the same rotation as the destination or B) maintain \"ship's time\" independent from their destination, set either from their port of origin or by CMT. The former is likely only done by smaller vessels, or by small non-crew groups on larger ships, effectively letting them cheat on \"hyperdrive lag\" in acclimating to the new rotation. The latter is more common with larger commercial and military vessels, as keeping to a strict, universal time table is often critical to operations and the individual comfort of the crew/passengers.  Regarding biological differences, it pretty much came down to \"go on human timing or go F yourself\". Even in the arguably more egalitarian Republic days, humanity had a dominant role in government and military, and when it comes time to get everyone to compromise on a schedule it's a human majority influencing the timing. Any species that couldn't hang with that timing was effectively handicapped, in turn further reducing their ability to influence the timetables and leading to a cycle where it was chiefly humans and human-equivalents making the calls on the schedule. In the Empire, which was a straight up human supremacist, this only got worse.  As far as the biorhythm of Jedi, they likely have techniques to get themselves on the schedule of new planets in rapid order; meditation, carefully timed resting to realign their sleep schedules, opening themselves to the local flow of life energy, that \"fists with your toes\" thing John McClane does, you know, whatever works."

Wikstr\u00f6m, Oberwittler, Treiber, and Hardie (2012) *Breaking Rules* is a more modern work that looks at crime as the result of the confluence of individuals with low self-control and criminogenic attitudes with criminogenic *contexts*, that is unsupervised and undirected socializing near poorly protected property. While more focused on adjudicating between broken windows and the collective efficacy perspectives on neighborhood crime, I like St. Jean's (2008) *Pockets of Crime* for its interviews with robbery offenders (and other offenders).

To understand why central banking and fractional reserve lending are bad requires a good understanding of Austrian Business Cycle Theory.  In a nutshell, artificial credit causes entrepreneurs to over-invest in capital goods because interest rates do not reflect the actual preference of consumers to save for the future.  These malinvestments are revealed in the bust phase of the boom-bust cycle.  A central bank doesn't \"smooth out\" business cycles, it exacerbates and enlarges them by providing even more fuel for the bubble phase.  There's a lot of resources out there about this, I'm sure they do a better job than I can.  >America, after the first central bank was abolished, ...  It is true Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson were staunch opponents against central banking.  They had seen the levels of debt the Bank of England had run up, and were committed to not inflicting the same thing to America.  Regarding the actual history of events surrounding the Federal Reserve Act, it was shady passage indeed.  A good book about the Federal Reserve's creation is The Creature From Jekyl Island.  >Gold is real wealth, not theoretical wealth  These are pretty vague terms.  It's better to say that gold is a better store of value than fiat paper, but it is not a better medium of exchange.    >Any Fiat currency is mathematically bound to\ufeff collapse  I haven't seen a \"mathematical\" proof to this one.  What is \"mathematically true\" is that our debt-based fiat system *requires* an exponentially increasing money supply.  That might be as benign as 2% nominal inflation, or as bad as hyperinflation.  It's up to the central bank's management of the money supply.  However, the system is not stable under 0% inflation or any amount of deflation.  If you also consider Cantillon effects of inflation, that is its tendency to distort the economy toward the sources of the new money (i.e. politically connected and financial sector), then wealth will concentrate in the those sectors and starve the real economy of resources.  If the central bank follows this with even more credit creation, as it is doing now with ZIRP and QE, we might conclude that the system is indeed headed for inevitable collapse.  Not surprisingly, ZIRP and QE have so far failed to restore unemployment to pre-2008 levels.  But in any case, this is not a mathematical \"proof\" of collapse, it's just an argument that central bank policy doesn't work.  >A nations wealth should be determined by it's value in resources, trade and business worth, not by the regulations of a central bank. Only god can make something out of nothing. Fiat currencies a prone to inflation and hyper inflation. Money needs\ufeff to be an I owe you for gold, not gold itself.  This is a bunch of nonsense.  What *is* true that he hints at is that hyperinflation cannot happen *without* a central bank.  So gold, if nothing else, is at least a protection against hyperinflation."

Although not a specialist, I've followed this particular matter in the local and foreign press, and I've spoken to a few people in the government who were supposedly \"in the know\".  Saudi had sporadic problems with terrorism since the 90's which intensified for a few years after the second gulf war, with AQP (Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) leading a rash of attacks mostly on western compounds and singular individuals.  The effect of the Iraq war on the Saudi populace's opinion cannot be overstated, it was of rage at what was seen as naked western aggression, this strengthened AQP and brought it local recruits and even a few individuals who acted independently. But they quickly over-reached, particularly in their attacks against compounds, where the overwhelming number of victims were Muslims and Arabs, and of course, the government made sure that this was the message that reached the public. This eventually helped put a major damper on the peoples support of AQP.  The government realized that it had a major problem on its hands, and they began a multi-pronged crack down on the group while also coming up with a rather brilliant plan to sap AQP of its recruits.   The person who lead Saudi's efforts was the head of Saudi's intelligence service, prince Mohammad bin Nayef, who began by rounding up known suspects and strengthening and restructuring the regular police force, both by increasing their numbers considerably and by allowing them to use more force. Prior to this, the police weren't allowed to even have bullets loaded in their guns, now they can shoot at the first sign of aggression. They were also reorganized, with a special anti-terrorism task force trained by the US and another more numerous street-level force that patrolled around high-value targets. This was the first prong.  The second prong was PR. The government went on a massive media campaign against terrorism, they blanketed the airwaves and print with articles from civil and religious leaders, all of whom were vociferous in their denouncement of terrorism. They didn't shy away from using shocking footage and pictures of the attacks either, images which repulsed most Saudi's and made them rethink their stance. They also removed troublesome imams, the radical ones who preached violence, from the mosques. In the meantime, the soldiers and policemen who were killed or injured on the job were lionized by the Royal family, with leading members of the family visiting them in hospitals, going to their funerals, and generously providing for their families. All this of course helped sway all but the most radical elements of saudi society towards the governments stance.  The final -and i think most important- prong was that the government began an amnesty program, where terrorists could surrender their arms and enter a rehabilitation program. This program has had a good record overall, with a low recidivism rate and a humanizing effect. By portraying the terrorists as \"prodigal sons\" and the government as a strong yet merciful paternal figure, the government appealed to arab society's tribal, paternalistic culture.  The combined effect of all the government's actions have been particularly successful, and although they are over the hump, so to speak, they're still vigilant against a resurgence, especially given the turmoil in the Levant and the ongoing Sunni-Shia hostilities."

                "content": " Anti-positivism is not fully the same as saying there's no true reality.  Weber was an anti-positivist (perhaps the first one to be explicitly so, since positivism in the social sciences only dates explicitly to Comte).  Instead of positivist, he's \"interpretivist\" (Simmel was the same).  That's not the same as arguing there's no true reality.  Weber's greatest work, *the Protestant Ethic*, make a neat little causal argument.  Here's James Coleman's illustration of it from *Foundations of Social Theory* (Coleman is one of the most important sociologists of the second half of the 20th century, and certainly the most important rational choice sociologist).  Coleman is using Weber to illustrate his \"boat\", his model for connecting macro-level change with micro-level interaction (the deck of the boat is macro, the keel is micro).  Coleman's take on Weber is not so important, but the point is this is anti-positive research that explains something--it's not arguing against true reality or anything.    In this case, it's explaining how Protestantism lead to capitalism.  It's important to also note what it's *not* explaining.  It's not explaining a general relationship between religion and economic systems.  It's not explaining a relationship between two variables that can be recreated under other circumstances (for Weber, most major changes were \"overdetermined\").  It's not explaining a general principle or law.  It's explaining the (single) origin of capitalism, which lies (for him) in Calvinism.  Most history, for example, is anti-positivist (or, perhaps more accurately, non-positivist).  Most socio-cultural anthropology similarly so (Geertz, though less loved than he was two generations ago, is explicitly a Weberian).  Now, the post-modernists took this to some sort of strange Platonic extreme of social constructivism.  Most social scientists have not found this useful, though some in anthropology continue to do so.    Here's a discussion from the top sociology blog about whether or not to drop post-modernism from theory classes (most people agree \"drop\").  This is not, however, an argument about positivism vs. anti-positivism--Weber stays in.  \"Understanding\", or *Verstehen*, the original concept that the anti-positivists were actually *in favor of*, still has a place in every sociological theory class.  Economics, psychology, and physical anthropology tend to have little room for this sort of interpretivism (they tend to be interested in universal, positive laws of human behavior); sociology allows for anti-positivism, but in general, high status work tends to be more positivistic; socio-cultural anthropology and especially history tend to find positivism less useful because they are interested in very specific questions (how this people at this time did this thing).  If history, anthropology, and some parts of sociology are interested in a general phenomenon--say the penetration of capitalism throughout the world-system--they tend to be interested in the variation throughout the world, rather than parsimonious, variable based laws.  Now, it's possible to do historical comparative work and try to come up with universal laws--the first two generations of historical comparative sociology was like this.  Tilly, for instance, argued that states *universally* were created in large part through a process of wars creating debts which had to be repaid through taxation which required larger, more central governments to collect.  Likewise, Skocpol argued for a universal process of \"social revolutions\" (think French Revolution social revolution because society change; American Revolution only a political revolution because only the government changed) that starts with the financial breakdown of the state.  Sure, she points out differences in her careful study of Russia, Chinese, and French cases, but what she's interested in is what they all have in common.  Hopefully that helps clarify some!  Antipositivism is not necessarily that extreme post-modernism that you have in mind (in sociology, we've found post-modernism less useful, except for maybe Latour and Foucault in specific subfields--perhaps an anthropologist or a geographer could explain why post-modernism is useful for research in their field)."

There are too many factors to consider many factors that could be argued either way.  If some could calculate everything perfectly to find out the overall benefit of purchasing one phone over another, I can guess that the benefit would be so minimal that it would not be worth the effort to actually figure it out.  In order for money to remain in the United States economy, it has many ways to be cycled back in, but I will focus on 3.  Purchasing of products used in manufacturing an item, employment of US workers, and taxes paid to the US government.    First if the purchasing of products used in the manufacturing of an item.  Since it is a smartphone that means that the majority of the products used to manufacture the phone come from all around the world, and very little of those items come from the US.  This means that of all the little parts that are manufactured for smartphones don't benefit the US in their manufacturing.  Neither company benefits the American economy on this front.  Employment of US workers would be another way for money to be retained in the US economy since American workers would pay income tax and purchase goods and services that will perpetuate the movement of money.  Since manufacturing for both phones does not take place in the US that means that neither company benefits the US from manufacturing.  Now Apple claims to have 66,000 employees in the US at of 2015.]  (https://www.reference.com/business-finance/many-employees-apple-b335018ef06d0da4) So that is 66,000 employees that receive paychecks and spend money in the US due to being employed.  [Samsung is a Korean company, but does maintain several divisions in the United States that employ American workers.  Samsung claims to employ 325k employees worldwide.  I can't find how many are employed in the US, but it is safe to say that it is significant.  In order to know which company benefits the US most in terms of employment, we would have to know the total amount employed by Samsung, and the total amount paid in American wages.  Wrapped up into this math is the employment derived from building store locations and other ventures that are hard to account for.  The third is taxes.  Companies have to pay US taxes even if they are not US companies, but there are a lot of loopholes that companies use.  In 2012 Apple paid about $6b in taxes to the U.S. while Samsung paid about $4b.  The problem is that I couldn't tell you the amount of taxes they are going to pay this year, and that would be knowledge needed in order to decide which phone to purchase this year.  There are also several outliers when it comes to figuring this all out.  Apple has made very little in philanthropic contributions, and until recently was know as a company that didn't give charitably.  Apple does pay a higher dividend yield to investors than Samsung, but since it is a tech company it does not have the same loyalty that companies like Pepsi or Disney have, which means lower overall stock value than the actual worth of the company.  You also have to look at the overall benefit of the world economy, because that will have a benefit on the American economy.  Since Samsung employs so many people and does a lot of charitable and environmental work, there is a great world economy benefit that allows for greater overall American exports.  In the end, it is impossible to actually calculate the benefit of purchasing either one smartphone or the other.  If one of these companies manufactured in the US then there would be a clear choice, but with things as they are it is best to just purchase the phone that tickles your fancy."

After the Revolution in 1917, divorce proceedings were simplified, with parties being able to get a relatively simple divorce through registering their request through the court. Alternatively, if both parties agreed to the divorce, the request was registered with the Registry Office and again divorce was granted. The procedure was made even simpler in 1926, when what was known was \u2018postcard divorces\u2019 were apparent. Either party would simply announce their desire for a divorce, either orally or by written notification.

I'm delighted to discover that she shares the same interest in social sciences as I do, but I don't think this book is a great introductory text to any field.      Aside from it being possibly a hard read, it's written from a period where methodologies were not as developed as today. Also we're from China. Schools don't teach critical thinking. A high schooler may very likely take what's in a book as \"the truth\". I also think the activity of reading books without knowing some context can do some harms. For example, if a highschooler in China encounters a misogynist point of view in a book written by an authoritive figure, they might take it at its face value. Whereas if they know the book was written in a period where misogyny was rampant, they could take some distance from the point of view.      Obviously I don't want to destroy her interest by commenting on her choice, so I'm hoping to recommend some books for her that are interesting, have less biases and more scientific rigour. It could be from any field, she doesn't know what to study in University so I'm hoping to help her discover some choices. It should be preferably not a theoretical text, but focus on one or more concrete questions, provides some context in the field and applies modern methodologies in its investigation. In this way she can be gently introduced the concepts and theories while they're being applied. Ideally the book should be somewhat popular so that there could be a translation.

The book is rich in terms of incorporating several perspectives (biological, psychological, sociocultural, ...) to make his points. At the same time, he seeks to promote critical thinking, e.g. the book's first part seeks to help readers to construct a \"myth busting tool-kit.\" His book also puts away the old and weary debate of nature *versus* nurture and teaches about nature *and* nurture (i.e. that humans are naturenutural).   ---  In other words, the book's description:  >There are three major myths of human nature: humans are divided into biological races; humans are naturally aggressive; men and women are truly different in behavior, desires, and wiring. In an engaging and wide-ranging narrative Agust\u00edn Fuentes counters these pervasive and pernicious myths about human behavior. Tackling misconceptions about what race, aggression, and sex really mean for humans, Fuentes incorporates an accessible understanding of culture, genetics, and evolution requiring us to dispose of notions of \u201cnature or nurture.\u201d Presenting scientific evidence from diverse fields, including anthropology, biology, and psychology, Fuentes devises a myth-busting toolkit to dismantle persistent fallacies about the validity of biological races, the innateness of aggression and violence, and the nature of monogamy and differences between the sexes. A final chapter plus an appendix provide a set of take-home points on how readers can myth-bust on their own. Accessible, compelling, and original, this book is a rich and nuanced account of how nature, culture, experience, and choice interact to influence human behavior."

Why? Because nearly all of Gates's fortune is in Microsoft stock. With 4.5% of the total shares outstanding, Gates is the largest single shareholder, and liquidating them all at the same time can have some pretty big impacts.  To understand why, you have to understand how stock market trades work. As of today, Microsoft has 8.35 billion shares outstanding. With 4.5%, that means Gates owns about 375,750,000 shares of Microsoft stock.   Stock market transactions in shares of companies like Microsoft occur between buyers and sellers. Sets of buyers put out offers at different prices, and sellers do the same. When a buyer and seller meet in price (or more precisely when the highest offer to buy meets the lowest offer to sell, with the difference going to those making the exchange happen), they make the exchange and leave the market. The price of a stock changes depending on how many of each group there are in the market, and at what prices they want to make transactions at. If there are more buyers than sellers, then buyers will run out of people to transact with at the current price, so they must be willing to pay more for the stock to match with sellers demanding a higher price. When that happens, the price of stock will rise. If more people want to sell than buy, the price must drop to bring those people willing to buy only at the lower price, and the market price falls.   Now what does this mean for Microsoft and Bill Gates? The number of shares traded in a day is referred to as volume. While the volume for a stock on any given day changes depending on how many traders there are, the daily average for Microsoft over the last 3 months was about 44 million shares. Remember, Gates has over 375 million shares. This means that if he were to immediately try to sell his shares, he would need to find enough individuals to purchase every single one. Yet on any given day, only 44 million shares of Microsoft are traded. Gates would put up his shares on the market for sale and, absent an anomalous day of high volume trading, he would exhaust the entire pool of people willing to buy at the market price. In order to sell he would have to reach out and locate more individuals willing to buy at lower prices. This would result in lower and lower prices as Gates attempted to sell all of his shares, and Microsoft's share price would plummet.   You may be wondering how far the Microsoft share price would drop. It's unclear. It could drop just a little if buyers stepped up to purchase the shares around market price, or it could plummet almost to zero as no one would be willing to buy at any price due to the huge number of shares available in the open market. I doubt it would fall that far, but no matter the degree, Microsoft would greatly fall in value. This price plummet would affect not only Microsoft, but also every index fund the stock is a part of as well as the many mutual funds and other institutional investors that own the stock as part of a larger portfolio.   When it comes down to it, I think the liquidation of Gates's fortune would cause some big ripples in the equities market. Whether they are permanent is another story, but the effects need not last forever to have some big impacts.   Hope this helps!"

We present new evidence from a natural field experiment in which we \u201cmisdeliver\u201d envelopes to rich and poor households in a Dutch city, varying their contents to identify motives for returning them. Our raw data indicate the rich behave more pro-socially. Controlling for pressures associated with poverty and the marginal utility of money, however, we find no difference in social preferences. The primary distinction between rich and poor is simply that the rich have more money.   At least in the Netherlands there's not a whole lot of connection between rich and poor. Though, note, that's a European country, as opposed to the United States, where we see more individualistic and a \"greed is good\" sort of culture at the moment. Personally, I'd trust a European company more than a company from the United States when it comes to delivering quality and socially responsible goods.    _______________________________________________________________  Searched on google scholar \"rich wealthy money sympathy empathy compassion\".

                "content": " What do you mean that it is abided by?  The idea of Ricardian Equivalence was more or less coined by Barro and it still is debated, but it is not something that is typically taken literally except for some extreme freshwater guys.  There was some heated debate a while back about this issue between economists like Cochrane and Delong.  Here is Noah Smith's post on the debate with some useful links  http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2011/12/great-ricardian-equivalence-throwdown.html  Edit: Barro later weighed in:  http://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications_papers/pub_display.cfm?id=3261&  >Barro: Let me say first that I think the Ricardian equivalence idea is basically right as a first-order proposition. However, people get confused as to exactly what it says. Before I say what that is, I should mention that, although the proposition is not mainstream in the sense of being fully accepted by most economists, the idea has had tremendous influence on the way economists think about this issue. Analysis often begins with Ricardian equivalence as a first-order proposition and then goes on to investigate why there are deviations from precise equivalence. Thus, like the Modigliani-Miller theorem on corporate finance, Ricardian equivalence has become a common starting point for the way people think about budget deficits. This situation is vastly different from what it was before the mid 1970s. To illustrate the potential pitfalls in what Ricardian equivalence says and does not say, one can consider the famous quote attributed to Vice President Cheney to the effect that President Reagan proved that budget deficits don't matter. The Cheney quote is often interpreted to mean that the level of government expenditure does not matter, and that surely is not what Ricardian equivalence says. The Ricardian proposition is about the consequences of paying for a given amount of public expenditure in different ways. Specifically, does it matter\u2014or does it matter a lot\u2014whether the government pays for its spending with current taxes or with current borrowing, which entails higher future taxes? So, a central part of the proposition is that the amount of public expenditure\u2014today and tomorrow\u2014is being held constant. It's never part of Ricardian equivalence that the level of government expenditure doesn't matter. As [University of Chicago economist] Milton Friedman put it, the costs or benefits of government outlays depend on the amount and nature of what the government spends\u2014there is no free lunch about paying for that spending. So whether you pay for it now or later is secondary. As a first-order proposition, it is right that it matters little whether you pay for government spending with taxes today or taxes tomorrow, which is basically what a fiscal deficit is. The difference between taxes today and taxes tomorrow is analogous to the difference between paying for spending with an income tax or a sales tax. The method of public finance is an important question, but it is less important than the question of how big the government is and what activities it should carry out. Taxing now versus taxing later is an issue about optimal taxation, that is, a public-finance topic. This view moves the analysis away from pure Ricardian equivalence to the optimal tax perspective, which brings in the principle of tax smoothing. The idea is that, unless something special is going on in different periods, optimal public finance dictates having tax rates, for example, on consumption or wage income, that are similar from one year to another. You do not want erratic movements in tax rates, because these patterns are highly distorting. From that standpoint, it is not desirable to have a very low tax rate today, financed by a fiscal deficit, followed by much higher tax rates in the future. This tax-smoothing result deviates from Ricardian equivalence, but in a  second-order way, in the same sense that the choice between an income tax and a sales tax is second order but nevertheless significant. Anyway, since we've talked so much about Ricardian equivalence, you might be interested in an anecdote. In 1973, I had worked out the basic invariance idea. If the government imposed some kind of intergenerational transfer\u2014through fiscal deficits or enlarged Social Security\u2014individuals who were connected through voluntary transfers to members of the next generation would neutralize the government's actions. All that was required was an interior solution for voluntary transfers from parents to children or in the reverse direction. Well, before I wrote anything, I sat down for a lunch with Fischer Black (famous, of course, for the Black-Scholes options-pricing formula). I took about 20 minutes to go through the whole analysis I had worked out. Fischer said nothing, but listened intently. When I finished, he uttered only one sentence: \"Sounds right to me.\""

                "content": " I would suggest that before asking \"how do we figure out what media content is actually 'bad for children'\" we should ask whether it makes sense to think in terms of categorically \"good\" and \"bad\" content and if this line of thought produces actionable intelligence.  Theoretically speaking, media content can be harmful in different manners depending on how harm is conceptualized. For example, media can be \"harmful\" in terms of (mis)information and (mis)education. Among many accomplishments, Fred Rogers \\(aka Mister Rogers\\) is known for his testimony before the U.S. Senate defending public television. To quote Strachan:  >Sitting in front of Sen. John O. Pastore, the chairman of the subcommittee, Rogers didn\u2019t get bogged down in budgetary minutia. Instead, **he talked about what he hoped to accomplish with his show. He used it, he said, to help children learn to deal with their problems in a healthy manner** \u2015 to instill a sense of confidence in the kids he worked with and who watched him. He used simple sentences and simple words to get his point across:  >>**This is what I give. I give an expression of care every day to each child, to help him realize that he is unique.** I end the program by saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve made this day a special day, by just your being you. There\u2019s no person in the whole world like you, and I like you, just the way you are.\u201d And **I feel that if we in public television can only make it clear that feelings are mentionable and manageable, we will have done a great service for mental health.** I think that it\u2019s much more dramatic that two men could be working out their feelings of anger \u2015 much more dramatic than showing something of gunfire.  Programs such as Sesame Street presuppose that media can be educational, and are beloved and praised for their pedagogical nature.  However, not all media serves the same purpose. There are many common beliefs and myths which have originated or have been promoted by television and films. For illustration, see:  * How Accurate are Crime Shows on TV? Debunking 7 Common Myths  * The 5 Biggest Tech Myths Perpetuated by TV Shows and Movies, According to Experts  Also see contemporary worries about \"fake news\" and disinformation.  Another manner in which media may be harmful is by producing undesirable behavior (multiple theories exist positing such a relationship). In the United States, there is much interest regarding whether violent media makes people violent. Relatedly, another popular topic is whether pornography contributes to sexual crimes. In recent years, there has also been much discussion about how media might increase suicide rates (e.g. see the controversy surrounding 13 Reasons Why) - I discuss that briefly in the comment attached to this one.   * See here for an overview about violent media.  * See here for an overview about pornography.  ---  There are no simple, straightforward, answers to these questions. We should not expect them, either. To quote Jewkes and Linnemann (2017):  >Scholars in the UK have strongly resisted attempts to assert a direct, causal link between media images and deviant behavior. The same cannot be said for those here in the United States, as researchers and various activist groups continue to search for links between things like video games or music and antisocial behaviors. Still, **for many, the idea of isolating television, film, or any other medium as a variable and ignoring all the other factors that might influence a person\u2019s behavior is considered too crude and reductive an idea to be of any epistemological value. Much effects research cannot adequately address the subtleties of media meanings, the polysemy of media texts** (that is, their being open to multiple interpretations), **the unique characteristics and identity of the audience member, or the social and cultural context within which the encounter between media text and audience member occurs. It mistakenly assumes that we all have the same ideas about what constitutes \u201caggression,\u201d \u201cviolence,\u201d and \u201cdeviance\u201d and that those who are susceptible to harmful portrayals can be affected by a \u201cone-off\u201d media incident, regardless of the wider context of a lifetime of meaning making.** Media effects research also tends to ignore the possibility that influence flows in both directions\u2014 which is to say that the characteristics, interests, and concerns of the audience may actually hold some sway over what the media produce.  This insight also applies to how media might or might not miseducate, misinform, etc. For example, take the (in)famous CSI Effect. As described in 2008 by Judge Donald Shelton, who together with two criminologists surveyed 1000 jurors:  >**Many attorneys, judges, and journalists have claimed that watching television programs like CSI has caused jurors to wrongfully acquit guilty defendants when no scientific evidence has been presented.** The mass media quickly picked up on these complaints. **This so-called effect was promptly dubbed the \"CSI effect,\" laying much of the blame on the popular television series and its progeny.**  He concludes with skepticism about whether the effect exists. If it exists, he concludes that it is negligible. A similar conclusion is reached years latter by Chin and Workewych \\(2016\\), who argue:  >**While researchers have not found a reliable effect of CSI viewership on conviction or acquittal, they have found evidence suggesting that the perceived realism of CSI and the expectations created by CSI may be impactful.** More specifically, those who ascribe a high degree of realism to CSI may be biased in favor of the prosecution when the prosecution leads forensic evidence (i.e., the defendant\u2019s effect). In addition, CSI viewership may increase expectations about evidence among some jurors, thus biasing them in favor of the defense.   Therefore, *if* there is an effect, it is not just about *content*: there are other factors to consider such as *framing*, and how people *perceive* the program.  ---  [Concludes next comment + ref. list]"

                "content": " The first thing to note is that Bourdieu wasn't the first one to make this call. Karl Polanyi, a prominent economic historian, wrote all the way back in 1957 in his book on early economic development, *Trade and Market in the Early Empires* (emphasis added):  >The simple recognition from which all such attempts must start is the fact that in referring to human activities the term economic is a compound of two meanings that have independent roots. We will call them the substantive and the formal meaning.  >The substantive meaning of economic derives from man's dependence for his living upon nature and his fellows. It refers to the interchange with his natural and social environment, in so far as this results in supplying him with the means of material want satisfaction.  >The formal meaning of economic derives from the logical character of the means-ends relationship, as apparent in such words as \"economical\" or \"economizing.\" **It refers to a definite situation of choice, namely, that between the different uses of means induced by an insufficiency of those means. If we call the rules governing choice of means the logic of rational action, then we may denote this variant of logic, with an improvised term, as formal economics.**^1  >The two root meanings of \"economic,\" the substantive and the formal, have nothing in common. The latter derives from logic, the former from fact. The formal meaning implies a set of rules referring to choice between the alternative uses of insufficient means. The substantive meaning implies neither choice nor insufficiency of means; man's livelihood may or may not involve the necessity of choice and, if choice there be, it need not be induced by the limiting effect of a \"scarcity\" of the means; indeed, some of the most important physical and social conditions of livelihood such as the availability of air and water or a loving mother's devotion to her infant are not, as a rule, so limiting.\u00b7 The cogency that is in play in the one case and in the other differs as the power of syllogism differs from the force of gravitation. The laws of the one are those of the mind; the laws of the other are those of nature. The two meanings could not be further apart; semantically they lie in opposite directions of the compass.  >**It is our proposition that only the substantive meaning of \"economic\" is capable of yielding the concepts that are required by the social sciences for an investigation of all the \u00b7empirical economies of the past and present.**^2 The general frame of reference that we endeavor to construct requires, therefore, treatment of the subject matter in substantive terms. The immediate obstacle in our path lies, as indicated, in that concept of \"economic\" in which the two meanings, the substantive and the formal, are naively compounded. Such a merger of meanings is, of course, unexceptionable as long as we remain conscious of its restrictive effects. But the current concept of economic fuses the \"subsistence\" and the \"scarcity\" meanings of economic without a sufficient awareness of the dangers to clear thinking inherent in that merger.  Let's talk about the bolded parts, indicated by ^1 and ^2.  ^1 Here Polanyi essentially defines \"formal\" economics as the style of economics found in contemporary economic departments: \"optimization\" modelling founded on the axiom of scarcity.   ^2 Here Polanyi proposes that his \"substantive\" definition of economic study, roughly analogous to Bourdieu's \"study of all practices\", is the only (a) empirical and (b) productive way to study economics in human society, and that the \"formal\" methodology is both unnecessarily constraining and doesn't yield accurate results.   The problem, according to Polanyi, is that formal economics starts with a framework and tries to cram human behavior into it. I say \"framework\" and not \"theory\" because utility maximization is technically unfalsifiable, which, if we accept Popperian standards, makes it unscientific. You can technically construct a utility function that \"explains\" any set of behavior, and so the effectiveness of the framework is limited. Polanyi, and Bourdieu in line with him, were advocates for a more anthropological study of economics, that is to say, one founded first and foremost on real-world observation of real economic activity, broadly defined as any activity that satisfies human needs (a bit of an outdated functionalist definition, but let's run with it for the time being).  So what have been the results? Well, Polanyian \"substantivism\" is well-represented in other social sciences that purport to examine economic behavior, like sociology and anthropology (see more about the formalist-substantivist debate summarized here). However, it has made limited inroads into economics proper because the entire economics discipline is basically founded on the formal method. If substantive thought made any significant inroads into economics proper, it would basically mean tossing out all of the economic modelling that has defined economics for the last century, so I personally don't see it happening \"from the inside\" any time soon."

The intuition here is to see it as a shift in how we view labor, sort of as an extension of romantic visions of the past that were popular in the late 19th century.  So, was alienation a real social phenomenon, or does it require an unscientific / non-historical understanding of how goods were produced in pre-industrial society?

                "content": " The technical meaning of alienation in this context (which sounds like it comes from Marx) is being able to sell something for money. For example if something is alienable it means it can be sold and transferred to new ownership. It's not the modern context of the term like an 'alienated teenager' (if only these could be transferred to new ownership). Marx uses this term in part to get at his concept of abstract labour or labour which is a commodity and is simply purchased as part of the production process. Prior to the industrial revolution it was far more typical to sell finished goods but not labour itself. It's also important to remember how scarce money was through much of this period. Tally sticks were more often used for settling accounts in rural England than coin money and and settling accounts was part of festivals that were a common part of village life (Graeber, 2011).    Alienable labour came into common use in europe through the manor system. Villeins would customarily work a set number of days for the manor lord as payment for rent. As money became more common wealthier peasants began paying in cash rather than through customary labour. This created a split between wealthy farmers and subsistence farmers who still paid land rents in labour. As cash rent became common more and more subsistence farmers became dispossessed from their lands as manor lords became accustomed to cash payments for rent. For villeins there were many ways to resist having their labour appropriated by a lord. Villeins typically would arrive late or not at all, spend most of the day chatting or resting and do the bare minimum of labour on the required work days. Holidays, which there were many, were also a means of resistance as villeins would often protest any labour obligations that fell on a traditional holiday, no matter how obscure. So the landed gentry had less of a great source of labour appropriation than a giant pain in the ass. The reemergence of the cash economy and cash rents changed this.    At the same time the enclosure movements were talking place so formerly common lands were being appropriated by lords and stiff penalties for poaching, foraging and wood gathering (all of which were customary common rights) were enacted. This meant land less peasants had little choice but to sell their labour in order to make a living. Prior to this moment most people simply lived off the land and the commons (or were part of artisan classes who worked in the guild structure). The emerging capitalists used this labour force to undermine the power of village guilds or set up in 'greenfield' sites such as Manchester that had no established guild structure. Wage labour however was extremely frowned upon. 'Gerrard Whistanley, leader of the diggers, declared that it did not make any difference if one lived under the enemy or lived under one's brother if one worked for the wage.' (Federici, 2014). The Diggers or Levelers were so named because they would organize to dig up or level the enclosing hedges.   So yes unalienated labour was a thing. Most people sold the products of their labour but not labour itself. Most of rural life was subsistence farming and people who were able to be self sufficient had no reason and a deep resentment for the conditions of waged labour (aka alienated labour). It took breaking the artisan class and the peasant class for a reserve army of industrial labour to be created and wage labour to become the norm.

There were major, substantive, paradigm-destroying debates in macro during the 1960s (Keynesian/Monetarist), 1970s (Keynesian/New Classical) and 1980s (New Keynesian/Real Business Cycle) but we've largely converged since the early 1990s. Almost all applied macroeconomic research is New Keynesian of some flavor, with heavy methodological influence from the New Classical and Real Business Cycle theories. Time will tell if the rise in agent-based computational macro will prove to be as paradigm-destroying as Lucas' program was forty years ago.  We have largely coalesced on a common language for modelling (DSGE), a common baseline language for causal inference (SVAR, though it's far from perfect), a common language for thinking about economic shocks (impulse, amplification, propagation), and a common language for thinking about the role of inefficiencies in the economy (wedges). By 2007, we had a few working medium-scale models that economists mostly agreed were ready for use in policy analysis (with some vocal exceptions).   We continue to disagree, sometimes heavily, on the empirical importance of the various wedges, frictions, and market imperfections in the economy. The financial crisis has weakened the c.2007 consensus somewhat - the much-vaunted policy models weren't able to analyze large financial panics.  There is serious lack of data in macro, and an equally serious lack of good identification techniques (what natural scientists would recognize as \"natural experiments\"), which makes inference difficult.   The proliferation of divisions of macro in the **public policy sphere** can be attributed to politics, lack of data, the public debate lagging the academic literature, etc.  The public lags the academic literature; that's fine. It means that in the public sphere the trifecta of Keynes, Hayek and Friedman continues to have sway on how people think about macroeconomic policy, even though all three of those thinkers had become irrelevant by 1972, their main insights absorbed into the body of academic work.    I have a pet theory that the \"divisions\" in macro, that we see in the popular media, are manifestations of the general need for a \"story\" or \"narrative,\" akin to political narratives, but it's just an hypothesis."

                "content": " A hundred years ago, you could ask why Catholic countries had so many religious based parties compared to the rest of the world because of Christian Democratic parties, which are still active in many parts of the Europe and Latin America as important social and economic conservative party (*edit*: originally, I wrote \"dominant\", but Christian democratic parties are senior coalition or potential senior coalition partners in a few countries, most notably Germany, but Christian Democratic parties are in or would be in center-right coalitions in a wide stretch of European and Latin American parliamentary democracies.  Many parties associated with Christian Democracy, like Spain's People's Party, do not necessarily have \"Christian Democracy\" in their party name; the \"Centrist Democrat International\" was founded as the \"Christian Democrat World Union\", the slightly more conservative equivalent to the various Socialist Internationals, and the EU level party \"European People's Party\"). The standard book on the origins of this is *The Rise of Christian Democracy in Europe* by Kalyvas (1996), which is fascinating and gets into how these movement emerged even without the powers that be really wanting them to organize as such. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, see Christian democracy on Wikipedia.  One of the things to keep in mind is that involvement in a democratic system moderates parties (this know as moderation theory, but it's really related to the \"median voter theorem\", which argues that parties tend to move towards the median voter over time). The two main examples of this moderation are European Social Democrats and European Christian Democrats, both of whom started out fairly radical but are now often the mainstream Center-Left and Center-Right parties, respectively, in Europe. G\u00fcne\u015f Murat Tezc\u00fcr applies this theory to Muslim parties in Iran and Turkey in *Muslim Reformers in Iran and Turkey: The Paradox of Moderation* and find it works, but modifications are necessary because of the role \"guardians\" (the military in Turkey, the literal Guardian Council in Iran) in these imperfect democracies. I forget what modifications he exactly proposes, though, to be perfectly honest. Kurzman and Naqvi's \"Do Muslims Vote Islamic\" (Figure 2, pg. 58 and Figure 3, pg. 59) presents further evidence for the moderation of Islamist parties over time.  The thing is, historically in the Middle East, like many other places, beyond specific grievances, there are relatively few things to mobilize around: class, religion, ethnicity. In the Arab world, ethnicity is pretty homogeneous so beyond pan-Arabism (one of the dominant movements of the middle of the 20th century) you don't have much with ethnicity (in Turkey, you do with the Kurds, in North Africa, a little with the Berbers, here and there in Iran). Pan-Arabism was dominant among the ruling groups in the Arab republics (Iraq, Syria, Egypt) and important in some of the monarchies (the \"nationalism\" in Anderson's *Nationalist Voices in Jordan* is pan-Arab nationalism, not Jordanian nationalism). This, however, just straight up failed as the local elites would generally lose influence in that situation, so though the middle \"effendiya\" class voted and supported pan-Arabism where they could, the elites made sure it never came to fruition (Anderson has a particularly good section on how this happened in the 50's in Jordan, but see the failure of the United Arab Republic of Syria+Egypt and Ba'athist politics more generally for how it failed in the Republics). In the 1940's, two of the largest civil society groups were the Communist Party of Iraq and beyond and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and beyond. The Communist Party and labor unions more generally was eventually more or less beaten or co-opted into Arab socialism (most Arab dictatorships often used corporatist systems where there was essentially one national union controlled by national elites, see the UGTT in Tunisia as an example, though some countries allowed more independent labor unions), while the Muslim Brothers were alternately oppressed and tolerated (oppressed particularly when they condoned violence with people like Sayyid Qutb, tolerated particularly when they renounced it under I think Hudaybi or maybe Tilmisani). By the 90's, in many Arab states, the Muslim Brotherhood-like organizations were essentially the only tolerated, large, independent civil society group. They tended push the regimes, but in predictable, tolerable ways, unlike say strong labor unions (though Egypt had relatively strong labor unions) or the like. So therefore, in every transition or near transition to democracy, Muslim Brother-like groups dominated because they were often the only major organized opposition, the only group that could politicize *and* had people in every province, every major city, besides the regime (the Algerian regime rather famously found this out during their near transition to democracy in the early 90's, when they did half a round of voting and the Islamists absolutely killed it in every first past the post single member district; Hamas, the \"non-regime\" party in Palestine, is an off-shoot of the Muslim Brothers, etc. etc.). That's why it's no surprise the run-off for president in Egypt was a close race between a Mubarak crony [Shafik] and a (moderate) Muslim Brother [Morsi]--they were really the only two widely organized groups. Because of the organizational advantages, any system that uses local single member first past the post districts (think US house districts) will return a huge number of religious candidates. This is what happened in Egypt recently, and Algeria a two decades ago. If you make voting rules different, say a single nation-wide district with pure proportional representation (think voting for Israel's Knesset) you get a result like Tunisia where Muslim parties still have a strong showing, but the opposition is i) more represented, ii) less tied to the old non-democratic regime, iii) capable of getting more organized. (See Al Stepan's \"Tunisia and the Twin Tolerations\").  It's funny because this happens even in relatively mature democracies, like Turkey where, as Cihan Tugal's *Passive Revolution* and Jenny White's *Islamist Mobilization in Turkey* show, the non-religious parties really don't even try to organize at the grassroots level among the urban (and presumably rural) poor [far left parties used to be active in these neighborhoods, and interestingly, in Turkey, the Islamist parties when they first started organizing in these neighborhoods were pretty left economically, though today they are neither particularly statist nor redistributive].  So in young democracies and authoritarian states with strictly limited civil societies, you see the dominance of Muslim Brotherhood-type parties. In more mature democracies, like Turkey's, you see much more mature parties like the AKP, who it is hard to argue are more religious than the American Republican Party, for example.  They are socially conservative and Islamically inspired, for sure, but they aren't advocating mandatory headscarves, or complete alcohol bans, or abortion bans, or Shariah law in criminal cases, or really anything along those lines (though some have argued this is changing with, for example, the recent changes in rules about alcohol sales, these limits are still within the realm of \"normal\" for Western democracies).  In other Muslim countries that have bad more vibrant civil societies, like Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Indonesia, you rarely see religious parties get more than 10-20% of the vote (see Charles Kurzman and Ijlal Naqvi's article \"Do Muslims Vote Islamic\"). Indeed, Turkey's more explicitly religious parties, like Refah and Fazilet, contested elections they also tended to get similar results. Only when the moderate wing of those parties broke off to form the AKP did they become *the* social conservative party in Turkey. Mainly, in early elections, the AKP stood on anti-corruption, pro-economic growth, pro-EU, pro-good governance platforms, and general populism.  Ziya Onis makes the point that, in Turkey (and it's easy to generalize this point), Islamist parties are the only ones that can make cross-class coalitions, bringing in counter elite pious businessmen from the Central Anatolian periphery (money for election campaigns) with urban poor (votes).  So, to sum up, those \"fairly liberal\" groups you remember from 70s and 80s are still there (in Turkey, they're know as they Beyaz T\u00fcrkler), but political liberalization has allowed a new counter-elite to emerge.  The \"liberalism\" was often very state driven. Often the only thing the counter-elite had to mobilize around was religion. And, since secularism was associated with the state, it's natural to oppose it, see Ahmet Kuru's *Secularism and State Policies Toward Religion* which argues that in places where the *previous* regime was strongly tied with religion (like Turkey and France), there tends to be an assertive secularism, whereas in places where the previous regime was not strongly tied to the religious establishment (like in the US), you tend to have a more passive secularism.  We can probably flip this argument on its head and argue that states where the regime are assertively secular, we get more assertively religious opposition parties. While some groups may seem relatively radical now, in the long term, we can expect these groups to moderate (*if* democracy continues, that is--Turkey, for the time being, is when this happens. Algeria, with its long campaign of counter-regime Islamic terrorism, is perhaps a frightening example of what happens when democracy is taken away). This simplifies a few things, leaves out most of the economy and the effect economic liberalization (\"free markets\" or \"neoliberalism\", depending on your political preference) have had, but a first step in that direction may be Noah Feldman's fun article in the *New York Times Magazine* called \"Why Shariah?'. The summary of that article is that things like \"shariah\" mean \"cutting off hands\" in the West, but to many people in these countries it simply means \"justice\" (and if you'd lived under generations of dictators, justice might sound nice). It's no accident that so many of the Islamist parties have \"justice\" in their name (Turkey, Morocco, Egypt, definitely, I think Jordan and Pakistan and several others.).   While there are relatively few Buddhist countries where the major conservative party is implicitly or explicitly religiously oriented, this is common in parts of Europe (particularly explicit in the Catholic parts), the United States, parts of Latin America, and India (see the BJP or Hindutva).   *edited a little for clarity when off mobile*."

We can talk all we want about Tsarism or the tradition Russian state or debate the insights of Dostoyevsky into the Russian mind but in reality the causes are much more immediate. Most Russians today are really pissed off over what happened since the fall of the Soviet Union and have seen their country fall from superpower status into the chaos and depression of the 90s into what is today at best a declining regional power. There is a very strong sense of resentment by the ordinary Russian towards the west for what it sees as betrayal.  What is actually hard to westerners to grasp is what it feels like to be on the losing end of a geopolitical struggle (because the west as a whole have being top-dogs since the mid 19th century if not the 18th) and seeing your country literally fall apart into a dozen pieces. Imagine if the US fell apart into like 10 different parts and you were a citizen in rump US 20 years later. There's a pretty good chance you'd be cheering at rump US reconquering the seceded area of California or whatever.  Crimea is something which most Russians sees as Russian because lots and lots of Russian blood has being shed over it in the 19th (Crimean war) and 20th centuries (WW2) and is historically Russian (as oppose to Ukrainian). Whereas most of the other areas former USSR has either 1) too many people of the wrong ethnicity (central Asia, western Ukraine) to consider reabsorbing or 2) Is on friendly terms with Russia and looks like its going to be part of Russia/Russian led Eurasian Union anyway (Belarus).  So basically it sort of comes down to Crimea is historically Russian territory whom the ordinary Russian has a good deal of emotional attachment to and really wants to get back. This has very little to do Russian philosophy or w/e but is mostly just Revanchism for lost territories.  P.S Putin don't actually expects anyone to believe the story about \"self-defense\" forces taking over the Crimea. They are basically just using this as an opening negotiating position with the west. This makes a lot more sense once you realize Russians sees western rhetoric about human rights in the exactly same way and as a tool to beat down their country."

Fannie and Freddie went from holding a high of 48 percent of the subprime loans that were sold into the secondary market to holding about 24 percent.  The reason for this was that private Wall St. firms got into subprime securitization in a big way in the 2000s (and were making money hand over fist, for a time).  Can't find the source ATM, but circa 2006 Fannie decided that the reason they were losing market share so fast to private firms was that their underwriting standards were higher. Consequently, they lowered their standards to compete. This was already well into the housing bubble.  The \"Carter/Clinton caused the bubble via the CRA\" canard is another common talking point.  However, most of the subprime lenders of the 2000s were not subject to the CRA, which applies only to traditional banks (banks which actually weathered the recession well compared to other players in the mortgage industry).  The CRA never required banks to abandon proper lending standards, regardless.  Those who use this talking point never present evidence to back their claim.  Probably the best explanation of what the heck happened in the housing bubble is NPR's Peabody Award-winning broadcast, The Giant Pool of Money.  tl;dr version: in the 2000s, there was more demand (globally) for investment opportunities than there were viable investments. Wall St.'s way of meeting the demand was to go big on mortgage-backed securities. In order to create enough securities to meet the demand, more mortgage loans had to be issued.  Bad decisions snowballed from there, such as lowering lending standards down to nothing, leaning on rating agencies for AAA ratings, championing flawed formulas that masked the risk, etc."

This article by Brian Deer for the British Medical Journal goes into more detail, but essentially -- Wakefield was a physician who forged results in several studies for financial gain. He first \"found\" a link between the MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine and Crohn's disease and claimed that people shouldn't get the combined vaccine. Coincidentally, months earlier he had patented a new measles-only vaccine.  He then published a highly controversial and, unfortunately, influential paper in 1998 that claimed the MMR vaccine was linked to autism. This is where your Jenny McCarthy's et al get this information. It has since been found that not only did Wakefield forge data in the study to make it seem like the MMR vaccine led to autism in children, but the entire time he was conducting the study at the behest of a lawyer who was attempting to sue vaccine manufacturers and was looking for a scientific standing to do so. Over two years, Wakefield made almost \u00a3500,000 to conduct this research.  So, to answer your question, while I cannot say whether or not Wakefield truly believed in his heart of heart's that what he was doing was right, what *is* clear is there is plenty of money to be made in deceiving the public and preying on the fears of grieving or scared parents."

Those who suffer from chronic pain or insomnia help fill out most of the remaining 10%.  Suicide is also considered \"contagious\", in that the more incidents of suicide there are at a given time, the more likely it is for someone contemplating suicide to follow through.  Personally, I've never considered philosophical positions to be instigators of anything, but rather symptoms of  beliefs/mentalities/ideologies that the person already had, either due to past experiences, trauma, or biological factors.  Same goes for the concept of an \"existential crisis\" - if such a thing really exists, it exists only as a rationalization by someone already suffering from either depression, substance abuse, or at best marginalization due to cultural factors."

                "content": " I'm going to keep this short.  These answers are mostly subpar at best.  What makes something \"tribal\" or \"not tribal\" is the first question to ask. If Africa is or was tribal until recently, by many accounts, much of Southeast Asia (and obviously Central Asia and Southwest Asia and perhaps even much of Eastern Europe) were \"tribal\" through the 20th century, for example, and much of Africa was historically incorporated into things that were clearly *not* tribes (states, empires, the like).  Since this is \"AskSocialScience\", let's look at some actual social science that's not Jared Diamond (I, unlike most anthropologist, think Diamond might have something useful to add to the table, but only after we frame the terms of the argument).  The best place to start is almost certainly the article \"Talking about 'Tribe': Moving from Stereotypes to Analysis\".   It's freely available, an easy, edifying, and enjoyable read, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.  I know some of you won't click through, so let me just put the title of each section in bullet points.  Seriously though, most of these sections are only a paragraph or two, you can seriously bust through the whole thing in like ten to twenty minutes depending on how fast you read (even without any background in the subject).  Worth it.  **Section 1: What's Wrong with the word] \"Tribe?\"**   * Tribe has no coherent meaning.  * Tribe promotes a myth of primitive African timelessness, obscuring history and change.   * In the modern West, tribe often implies primitive savagery.   * Images of timelessness and savagery hide the modern character of African ethnicity, including ethnic conflict.   * Tribe substitutes a generalized illusion for detailed analysis of particular situations.   **Section 2: If \"Tribe\" Is So Useless, Why Is it So Common?**   * Tribe reflects once widespread but outdated 19th century social theory.   * Social theories of tribes resonated with classical and biblical education.   * Tribe became a cornerstone idea for European colonial rule in Africa.   **Section 3: But Why Not Use \"Tribe?\"** This section answers common objections like:   * In the United States no one objects to referring to Indian tribes.   * Africans themselves talk about tribes.   * African leaders see tribalism as a major problem in their countries.   * Avoiding the term tribe is just political correctness.  * Rejecting tribe is just an attempt to deny the reality of ethnic divisions.    Then there are several **case studies**:    * Zambia  * Hutu/Tutsi  * Zulu Identity in South Africa   * The Yoruba People  **tl;dr** Tribe is probably wrong word to use.  A lot of what are called \"tribes\" in Africa would simply be called \"ethnic groups\" in other parts of the world.  The Yoruba \"tribe\" has *20 million people*.  The Swedish \"tribe\" only has 7-8 million people (the Catalan \"tribe\", who like the Yoruba lack an independent state, has about 8 million people in it).  We talk about African tribes for historical reasons (i.e. the first colonists talked about them like that), not for social scientific reasons.  Seriously though, if you're interested enough to check the tl;dr, you're probably interested enough to at least start the article I linked to.  Feel free to stop when you think it gets boring or BS-y, but I don't think you will.  If you're wondering why Africa is less economically developed than the rest of the world, I'd recommend look at /r/AskHistorians--they have a popular questions list, and one set of them is [\"Why is Africa 'less developed'?\" where you can browse through several questions that deal with the matter far better than I could.  Look out particularly for /u/khosikulu's contributions, as they are regularly in-depth, informed, and excellent, though he is certainly not the only one providing such explanations.  p.s. OP I think you asked a fair and important question, and if this came off as snooty, it's only because I'm a little frustrated at the quality of the answers that reek of \"common sense\" and pop explanations, rather than an appreciation of the current literature in any social science disciplines, which is what I assume you came here for."

Here's the full quote from a discussion on another sub on nudist colonies:  >The reason nudity is sexual is that it's only used in a sexual context in many places (especially the USA. If everyone goes nude all the time, seeing someone nude in itself is not arousing.  Did not humans evolve to be *visually attracted* to the opposite sex  (or what ever is appropriate for LGBT perspectives), with these feeling regularly extending to outright lust?   (Visual attraction has been documented in numerous animals.) With the attraction being much stronger in males toward women than vice versa (hence the widespread interest in girlie magazine and watching strippers.)  And clothing, aside from protection against the elements and a display of beauty/handsomeness, also serves to help limit situations of men becoming overly aroused/aggressive towards women?  (crudely put)  Muslim's cultures' strong prohibitions against women revealing themselves seems to be a strong example of this.  And don't we see similar prohibitions worldwide, perhaps more notably in Asian cultures, where nudist colonies are more rare.  And allied to this perspective is the concept of *modesty,* which is more evident in women than among men.  Is this all simply learned behavior?  Or is it at some level inherent to human nature?\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " So, in both your OP and in comments throughout the thread it appears that you are framing sexual attraction between men and women as an essentially biological fact. This is, to some extent, true (men and women have been fucking each other for millennia).    However, this does not necessarily have any relation to how much skin is on display. Anthropologically speaking, it doesn\u2019t hold more or less true for cultures which esteem modesty. There are many peoples historically which take and took a distinctly \u2018clothing optional\u2019 approach. This does not erase sexual attraction between genders.       Ultimately, sexuality *is* socially constructed as well as biological. A titillating photo of Marilyn Monroe with her skirt blowing up is sexy in part because she was beautiful but also because of social context. In the US, nudity has LONG been framed as predominantly sexual. This can be explicitly linked to the Hayes code and resulting iterations of censorship law in film and TV (In the US, nudity is much more strictly controlled in media than violence, gore, and gunfire). Going further back, we can point to a distinct Puritan influence which took a similar view on women\u2019s modesty and men\u2019s rapaciousness as much of modern Islam.   I could go on and on, but my biggest recommendation is to look into the social construction of sexuality, and get past the idea that \u2018 man+woman=sex\u2019, \u2018men are more sexually attracted to women than vice versa,\u2019 and \u2018a naked lady is a sexy lady\u2019 are somehow biological imperatives.  *Edit:*   Sources:   Foucault: The History of Sexuality    Bourdieu: Masculine Domination   Bourdieu: Distinction   Goffman: The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life   Butler: Gender Trouble   Greer: The Female Eunuch   Funke: The Gender Delusion"

                "content": " I'll start with contending the claim that \"they\" got the election predictions \"so wrong\".  In my opinion, there was one top quality poll-analysis source in that election - 538 - and they had Trump at ~30%.  Getting a result you've predicted at 30% likelihood isn't \"so wrong\".  The NYT upshot model was (IMO) of only slightly lower quality and still predicted 15% chance of Trump.  Not \"so wrong\" either.  538 has an analysis of what went wrong, with links to many other aggregators.  There were two major factors:  1. Bad poll aggregation by some aggregators, with the major factor being not dealing with correlated polling errors pulling several states in the same direction. 2. Polls were systematically off.  This is not atypical^(1), and the errors are about average for the last 50 years.  They were smaller than in 2012.  ## Bad poll aggregation  For poll aggregation, the big one is not dealing with covariance between different states; that led to most of the ridiculously off estimates.  538 had the estimate of Trump winning within a typical polling error, a typical polling error happened, and Trump won.  So IMO they've not been wrong.  NYT upshot was (as far as I can tell, because I can't find full details on their model) missing a fair number of factors leading to extra variance.   In particular, they were not weighting co-variance for states as much as 538, and they were not (as far as I can tell) correcting the poll for either bias (leaning towards D or R) or for historical accuracy for that pollster.  The Princeton Election Consortium were also missing the co-variance of state groups - underestimating it by a factor of 5, they say, though it's unclear how they would even model co-variance given how they do their calculations.  Their new model seems to only have the idea of all-state co-variance rather than state groups/demographics.  The Huffpost model used a modified average, with no look to co-varying poll errors.  It showed >98% in favor of Hillary Clinton.  Same with RealClearPolitics.   ## Polling errors and demographics  Let me explain a bit about polling and polling errors and how education comes into it.  Polling consists of selecting a panel of people to be contacted, contacting them, getting responses, and interpreting those responses.  If there was a way to select a 100% representative (or random) subset to be polled and a way to either get 100% response rate or make who responded/not responded random, we'd have a reasonably easy task of just doing some stats on some samples.  Alas, we don't.  It's slightly difficult to select an actually random set of people to try to contact, and it is impossible to get non-respondents to be random.  They're always a biased sample that's different from responders.  And this is a big effect - response rates are less than 10%.  Pollsters compensate for this by using the census.  They add in questions to their poll that match census dimensions, and use that to scale the responses.  If the census says that for the area they're polling they should have 18% whites and they got 30%, they'll scale that down.  If they should have 56% married and they have 40%, they scale that up.  Etc.  This compensates for the difference in response rates.  The census has a lot of questions, so pollsters can't put all of those questions in the poll - it would be so annoying to answer that they'd get even lower and more biased response rates, negating the benefit.   One question many of them *didn't* put on their 2016 polls was education level.  It unfortunately turned out that education level influenced both response rate and voting direction, so omitting it gave a systematic error.  This has been changed by many pollsters in 2020.  EDIT: Replaced \"Polling errors and politics\" with \"Polling errors and demographics\", which was what I had originally intended to write.  Also fixed a couple of typos.  ^(1): Jennings, W., & Wlezien, C. (2018). Election polling errors across time and space. Nature Human Behaviour, 2(4), 276-283. PDF"

I've read Nietzsche and then morals became very interesting to me, altough that made me often nihilistic in my moral positions. It's very frustrating but I face it as a necessary evil to have a better understanding about the existence of being. Now politics is becomming more and more yelling.  If you know my country situation, you may know that it's chaotic. We live in a huge economic crisis, corruption schemes are becoming more and more evident. Corrupt politicians are judged and arrested, then a few months later they are released. Our ex president Lula is arrested, but compete is still a possibility for him and he has the majority of voting intentions. The main opositor supports torture, consecrates the military dictatorship we had in the history of our country and he's a machine gun of ignorance.

Neighbor dumping trash into the street? You're going to smell it. Neighbor wants to knock down walls and remodel? It's probably going to affect your living space or quality of life. In cities, you're just closer to other humans so there's less live-and-let-live and more need for restrictions on what each individual can do.  Conversely, if I live out in the country, there's simply more space between me and my neighbor. If I want to build a barn there's little chance my neighbor is going to be affected. Likewise, what does some bureaucrat from the big city know about how my barn is constructed? I'm not hurting anyone by building it on my land so why should I need permits and clearance from some agency?  **Welfare**: In small communities you know your neighbors and you probably know when they're struggling. If Farmer Bob's crops failed this year the community is small enough that they might pitch in and help out. If everyone's crops fail then they're all going to pull together.   In urban communities however it's harder to tell who's in your \"community\" and therefore worthy of your aid. An average citizen can't help out every single homeless person so they look to the government to provide a social safety net.   **Experimentation vs. Tradition**: For hundreds of years (if not longer) cities were the hubs of education, art, and trade if only for efficiency purposes. It simply made more sense to have everyone come gather in one place to study or trade. Once you gather people together they can observe what their neighbor or competitor is doing and imitate it or improve on it. That means more experimentation in both economic and social norms. Additionally, history shows us that less people are \"from\" cities which means that they have less ties to any given tradition or social norm.   On the flip side, rural areas can often trace their lineage and the traditions of their ancestors back several generations. There's less incentive to shake up the social norm.   Anyway, all of these are broad generalizations and obviously subject to tons of exceptions, qualifications, and rebuttal but these are the most obvious reasons that I've read about."

My objective here is to provide some entry points (which can lead to other relevant readings) while promoting a multidisciplinary perspective which embraces the complexity of the topic (and the problem) and also highlighting the fact that there are multiple independent lines of research which support the existence of systemic racism in countries such as (not exclusively) the US. This being a popular topic, you can find a lot more spread around other threads in this subreddit, for which I would suggest hunting.  ---  (I am aware you are also interested in sexism. The fundamental points of my response apply, but the details differ. I agree with u/MildManneredCat that it deserves its own thread, as it is not the *same* thing.

                "content": " It's a position that bore that origins of modern day constructivist theory, which posits that an interlocking of structure (how things are organized) and process (how things are taught) help shape the political order in which states find themselves.  Assuming I'm reading your prof correctly, they're effectively explaining - in very simple terms - two challenges to prevailing neorealist and neoliberal arguments in international theory. I want to simply explain anarchy: anarchy is not chaos, but simply an archos, or \"without governance.\" What then, drives states to act the way they do? The answer depends on the theory, and I think your prof has folded in answer and critique into two of the major camps.  If you're unfamiliar with neorealism and neoliberalism, the former can be summarized as a focus on security that governs the sovereign wellbeing of the state against others, while the latter emphasizes positive-sum institutions and juridical spaces as rulemaking and normative systems that states abide by.  For the former, a state's focus is to govern itself based upon the threats around it, it's a theory of international relations which emerged most clearly during the Cold War, where both America and the USSR percieved any movement against their interests as threats to their political domain (see, \"Domino Theory\"). Thus, to neorealists, a state's desire to preserve its own wellbeing security-wise can be seen as a \"rational\" move, that it will also pursue the option that is least destructive to its interests. Jarvis' Four Worlds of Securitization, for example, gives a bit of insight into how a 'rational' actor might if it focuses purely on securitizing.  For the latter, it looks at how institutions and rulemaking, especially through material benefits, uplifts all involved actors, thus giving every actor an incentive to maintain the pre-existing order. The reconstruction of Japan can be seen as an example of neoliberal theory: the United States needed a significant player in the pacific to act as a bulwark against potential Soviet Aggression, so they had an incentive to shape Japan as a pro-democratic, wealthy neoliberal state while simultaneously placing, say, war criminals at its helm.  To both neorealists and neoliberals, while the world is \"anarchic\" in the sense that there is no real governing body that dictates the global realm, there are structures which can stand as a guiding mechanism: for neorealists, the states' interest in its own self-preservation against its foes will always dictate how it behaves. For neoliberals, institutions, money, and rulemaking are what determine how states operate.  Your prof's critique strikes at two major blind sides in both theories: one, international actors are not always rational. Iran's recent nuclear agreement with the Obama administration, for instance, demonstrates that security is not only a militarily existential concern, but also extends economically. Thus, what is presumed \"security\" can vary wildly between states. To a neorealist, Iran should have continued pursuing researching nuclear technology, especially after what happened to Ghaddafi and Libya. Second, terror organizations undermine neoliberal rulemaking rhetoric because they - by their nature as nonstate actors - cannot abide nor benefit from interstate rules. Al Qaeda, for instance, will never be allowed at any bargaining table because it is not a state, cannot bargain as a state, and is not beholden to state rules in an international sense. Yet, at the same time, these organizations (as we see in Boko Haram, the Taliban, and ISIS) can still play a role in shaping state behaviour. They cannot, in effect, be \"chained down\" by rules and norms the same ways states can.  In short, both presumptions about how to control states don't really work. To most neorealists and neoliberals, they may work in \"in general,\" but part of understanding the cases that fail demands understanding why they fail. I think your prof is probably drawing from Alexander Wendt's constructivist critique of anarchy in Anarchy is What States Make of It, where Wendt argues that not only is anarchy partly ideational (in that an order is imagined by its actors), but that anarchy is natural simply because state organization is collective, and such collectives can be hugely shaped by assumptions about goals, positions, and iterative practices which might not be shared globally.  To expand further on this discussion of anarchy, it is important to note that Wendt's concept of anarchy is siginficant in that anarchy has no clear value except what its actors pour into it. He uses the example of how when we think of anarchy, we might think of biker gangs, but we often don't think of monasteries, of which can be considered another form of \"an archos.\" The idea that the international system is \"anarchic\" does not mean that it is by default an innately dangerous or unruly place, but rather that nothing actually can govern the global order which we think of as the \"world\". \"States are not rational\" and \"terror organizations exist\" are two primary examples that hamper the emergence of any truly capable global order. I'd argue, with the emergence of global computation (such as Bratton's 'Black Stack'), we might see major corporations - especially tech companies - as further wrenches, not answers, to global anarchy.   Sorry if I made it more unclear. I wrote this on my phone so it's probably very garbled."

I always considered it inhumane and unreasonable to think it could be done humanely but my brother disagrees. He says, in theory, it would work very well, making sure our species evolves in the \"best\" way to prevent something like Idiocracy from happening. I think his view of the future of humanity is myopic and doesn't consider the increasing technology that could lead to genetic engineering and/or give way to Kurweil's prediction that we'll all be digital entities. I think we should put value on cultural evolution rather than biological evolution.  He also thinks that people of \"good\" genetics should reproduce more than people of \"bad\" genetics -- not forced, but people should make the choice themselves. I think it's unreasonable to assume we can determine which genes are best for the future of humanity. I think the future is far too chaotic and unpredictable to think we will know what's best for us.  Our argument was inspired by watching X-men 2. He told me he would be on Magneto's side, because they favor allowing mutants to live according to their mutation, e.g., a pyro living as a pyrotechnical, whereas Professor Xavier thinks mutants should simply live side by side non-mutants. All this on the premise that mutants are the next step in human evolution. I respond that evolution is too chaotic to determine what the \"next step\" is.  Also, my brother thinks people shouldn't be forced, but that people should do what they are genetically best at doing. I think this disregards the plasticity of the brain and our choices and skills, the social constructs that influence our social position and mobility, and the effect ecology can have on nurturing our biology.

Additionally, Darwin did not necessarily define the fittest as the strongest, or most clever, but recognized that the fittest could be those who cooperated with each other.

A very different view of violence and can really expand the understanding of it.

Therefore, the current best evidence-based recommendation is to not feed grain free dog food until further notice. * Anything related to the exact mechanism that causes DCM is speculation at this point. What we know is that \"grain free\" is the best predictor of DCM risk, which is what matters in practice at the moment.  * There has been a lot of \"manufactured controversy\" trying to distract owners from this basic fact, which should be ignored: We don't need to understand the mechanism behind the effect in order to observe that the effect is real. * If you feed a grain-free food on the FDA list, the recommendation is to switch foods gradually over a few days as with any other food switch in order to avoid GI upset. * Please check our FAQ and side bar for plenty of science-based resources on how to choose a good dog food.  As mentioned above, the FDA has now also released a list of affected foods.

We rescued a 8 week old puppy last weekend. When we got her she had just received her first round of vaccines the day before. She was extremely lethargic and didn\u2019t want to move at all except to go to the bathroom. She barely ate and drank water but had a little bit of food, which we thought was because she was adjusting or her vaccine. The next day she vomited and had diarrhea so we immediately took her to the emergency animal hospital and they said she has parvo. She\u2019s getting care now and the prognosis looks good so we should be able to pick her up in a day or so. We were originally planning to take her to puppy preschool where she could socialize with other puppies in a clean environment prior to all her vaccinations being complete, but now I\u2019m guessing we probably won\u2019t be able to attend that for a while.  We were thinking we should deep clean the apartment with bleach before she comes home, but I read that she would be shedding the virus up to 2 weeks after she recovers so then I thought maybe it makes sense to clean after that point so we can possibly join the puppy socialization classes in 2-3 weeks. But then I read that Parvo lives in carpet and other surfaces for many many months, so now I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s even worth cleaning and this means she won\u2019t be able to attend any socialization classes until 16 weeks, which concerns me a bit.  TLDR; puppy is recovering from parvo and seems to be doing well. Once she comes home and is fully recovered, we want to prioritize training and socializing, but not at risk of other puppies. Want to know if cleaning everything with bleach will help expedite the timeline of being able to socialize sooner or if it\u2019s not worth it\n\nAssistant:"

I took her in for her second round of vaccinations and to discuss potential dental cleaning as her breath was horrid.  &#x200B;  Backstory:  &#x200B;  I adopted her nearly 5 years ago. A dental expert estimated her age at about 5-7. She had horrid teeth. He removed 18 during a 2 hr surgery in Spring 2014. Even though I tried to brush them as best I could (she hated it) little by little tartar returned. In Nov 2016 she needed an emergency surgery for a bladder obstruction. Her bloodwork showed less than ideal liver numbers but she survived and had her teeth done again.  &#x200B;  Then in Nov 2017 I noticed her sleeping alot more. I noticed her eye was a little red. I took her for a senior check up and the doctor found a glaucoma. I tried treating it but she lost the eye in January 2018. Lost the second in March 2018. In February I had a eye puncture done to try and save her second eye but it failed so it was removed.  &#x200B;  With each of these surgeries I thought my dog was gonna die. The eye removals and bladder stones were emergencies and yet she lived.  &#x200B;  After her eyes were gone shr was unbothered. Lived her dog life. Didnt like walkig outside that much so I pushed her in a dog stroller. She was still eating etc. She was never \"active\" or playful. Just my dog.  &#x200B;  Jump to the present:  &#x200B;  Over the last few weeks Ive had a random (unexplained) anxiety about my dog dying. Like when I got home the first thing Id do was check that she was alive(?). She was 85% the same dog. But I did notice a few things:  &#x200B;  1. She was breathing more often through her mouth while asleep. She never did this but she is a smush faced dog so....  &#x200B;  2. She was panting indoors randomly. I attributed it to overheating (due to her long coat during summer) but it ws rare so I thought nothing much of it.  &#x200B;  2. She had a period of incontinence. She was peeing in her sleep and while standing (without squatting) without realizing it. And this is a dog who HATES her own urine. The vet did a bladder check and it was clear. Then for the next 6 weeks the incontinence stopped and she started getting up to use her in house pee pads again.  &#x200B;  3. About 4 weeks ago she started eating less. Usually she eats twice a day. But she was always picky (and blind) so I figured she was just not aware of the time. I bought her some cheaper (more fragrant) dog food and mixed it with water. She ate more at first. But then started eating once a day. Then eating 90% of the food a coming back for the rest hours later. 3 weeks ago she hadnt eating for like 36 hrs so I was worried. So I gave her some plain yogurt with low fat and water mixed in. She ate it. This is when I thought her teeth might be the reason. But again she simple returned to eating semi regularly. Though her love of table food waned. (Attributed to a sore mouth).  &#x200B;  Jump to today:  &#x200B;  I took her to the vet this morning. Discussed her teeth with the vet. I wanted to know the state of her mouth. And asked if it would be better to remove her leftover 22 teeth rather than putting her under again next year when she was even older.  &#x200B;  He said he needed an xray and inspection of the mouth. To get that he would have to put her under for a short time and he would need bloodwork and a heart and lung xray.  &#x200B;  So I agreed.  &#x200B;  Bloodwork came out mostly normal. Her inflammation numbers were up. But slightly above average.(likely cause of her mouth). Her anemic levels were low (slightly below average). All her number were normal or in 1-3 points of normal.  &#x200B;  This vet went through the same process for each surgery and was confident it was fine to proceed and I agreed. I handed over my dog and waited outside.  &#x200B;  Time passed. Other people were waiting. Both vets were in the OR with my dog. I could hear a machine beeping. But I remained calm because Ive heard that sound in surgeries before. 35 mins passed. I was getting a little worried. But figured they were working on another dog and mine was up next or got delayed and procedure started much later after they took her back.  &#x200B;  Then they called me in the exam room. I swear I was about to get my dog handed to me. And they asked me to come to the back.  &#x200B;  She was lying there with tubes in her mouth. Dead.  &#x200B;  They explained this:  &#x200B;  They administered a low level of propofol and when the medicine was pushed her lungs simply stopped pumping. They said this can happen in certain situations for a few seconds with dogs but the lungs will restart pumping. Hers didnt. So they pushed medicine to reactivate the heart. But it didnt work. So they tried for like 25 minutes to revive her and failed. She passed away and they never even got to the xray and exam.  &#x200B;  What the fuck?!?  &#x200B;  I couldnt believe it. She was old. But she her major organs were all in good health. She wasnt allergic to it as all her last procedures used the exact same medicine and in higher doses for a longer time.  &#x200B;  But this time it killed her. And I cant figure out why. They explained that this happened very rarely. And online research says the same. They are a busy vet and said this happens to them once a year but rarely twice.  &#x200B;  But what I cant find is an explaination. Why would a low dose of propofol cause lungs to simply stop? The only explaination I find online are all \"veterinary negligence\" which is possible. But in the years I went there when I heard  OR machines going both vets were always back there, the same as this time. Assuming it wasnt negligence on their part,  what could have caused it? Shock? I literally can find anything on it. Like no one studies the \"unknown\" anesthetic deaths or something but that cant be true.  &#x200B;  The more I think about it the more I feel like my dog was showing yellow flags that she was in a cognitive decline. Maybe she wasnt going to die right away, but she was slowly on her way. And this procedure at this moment pushed her over the edge and she died. And whatever caused it wasnt picked up by bloodwork tests or x rays.  &#x200B;  The vets arent bad people. Its possible they fucked up. But they seemed to be in just as much shock as I was. Because theyve done this hundreds of times before and this is the first sudden death in a while. They even paid for her funeral and cremation.  &#x200B;  I always figured she would get some acute disease like kidney failure and I would have time to  process her impending death and hold her while I put her down. She died at around 11:45 this morning. Thry told me at 12:13pm. I brought her ashes home at 3:00pm. And now her urn is sitting on a shelf in front of me.  &#x200B;  I had a dog exactly 12 hours ago. And now I dont.  &#x200B;\n\nAssistant:"

The biggest risk with propofol is apnea (stopping breathing). In most cases with healthy animals, their breathing slows down after the propofol is administered but not so much that they are in danger of dying, and after a breathing tube is placed and they are put on the anesthetic gas, they can be manually ventilated and their breathing becomes more stable. In the case of a senior dog with possible underlying conditions, it\u2019s possible that the decreased ventilation caused by the propofol was just too much for your dog to handle. As well, \u201csmushed face\u201d dogs have more difficulty breathing due to their anatomy. So it\u2019s also possible that the propofol caused hypoventilation or apnea and due to the anatomy of the dog combined with her age it was just too much for her.

But I think she needs mental help and I don't know how to help her.   My cat's name is Bean. I adopted her from a local animal shelter 6 years ago. When I walked into the cat room, she immediately started purring, loud enough that I could hear her from across the room. When I walked over, I discovered she only has 2 inches of tail. It was freshly shaven as if it was from surgery (so no she's not a minx). When I asked the center, they said she came like that, and they didn't know what happened. I fell in love with her instantly      When I brought her home, she refused to leave her carrying case for almost 3 days. We had to tip her out eventually. But she got used to my room and feels at home there now. She did NOT get used to our other cat, and they have now become the upstairs cat and the downstairs cat.   Bean was very skiddish when we got her. She still is. She won't let you pick her up, but if she comes to you she's more than happy to sit next to you. If you move near her, she gets scared. My parents and I think that someone abused her by cutting off her tail, and that she has kitty PTSD.   It's been 6 years since I adopted her, and we've made a lot of progress. I can pull her onto my lap sometimes (not that she stays there), and she understands that I'm not going to hurt her. But she still will not let us carry her (or if she does it's not with her cooperating). She is terrified to go to the vet. The last time we had to bring her she released the scent glands cats have, which I had never seen a cat do before. She won't let me carry her to find out how heavy she is, but she looks like she needs to lose weight.      We've tried the pheromone sprayers, and it helped her be less aggressive with our other cat, but she's still super scared.   How can I help my traumatized cat?      TLDR: My cat is scared of being picked up, people moving near her, and is aggressive towards our other cat, even after 6 years. We think she has trauma and was abused. How can I help her?   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Species: Cat  Age: \\* 6   Sex/Neuter status: \\* Neutered  Breed: \\* American Shorthair Cat (maybe? The adoption center wasn't sure)  Body weight: \\* Not sure. A little pudgy but not extremely round. We can't weigh her.   History: \\* Adopted from local center.   Clinical signs: \\* Doesn't like being held. Fearful of people moving.   Duration: \\* all her life  Your general location: \\* NE US\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " Kittens, like puppies, have a period of time while growing up where they benefit most from socialization and handling. Many stray or feral kittens still retain some of their \"wild\" nature if they live outside during that time. There's also likely some naturally shy and anxious elements in her personality that's contributing to her behavior. While we know that their memories are quite good, PTSD is only a diagnosable condition in humans and it's far more likely that this is just who she is. And accidents happen to animals that live outside at a much greater rate than humans abuse them. It's way more likely she had a close encounter with a car and had to have her tail amputated and that story just didn't get communicated.  However, that doesn't necessarily mean that there's nothing you can do for her. Feliway is a great first step. It's great that you've already seen a positive change! Also ask your vet about prescribing gabapentin for vet visits. It's a great medication for just taking the edge off their anxiety without being overly sedating. At home, I would just make sure that she has lots of places to hide where she feels comfortable, like boxes and a blanket in a dark closet corner, etc. And that's the most that most cats of those nature will need.   If you really wanted to go above and beyond, you could do some behavioral work, like finding a game that she likes to play and trying to get her to play some every day, using a clicker and teaching tricks and useful behavior (like sitting on a scale, for example), and perhaps even talking with your vet about anti anxiety medication to see if it makes a positive difference for her."

One of our clients was a retirement home for former agricultural workers that maintained a small herd of dairy cows. Long story short, one day we diagnosed one of the cows with bovine TB.  Obviously that caused quite a ruckus. These people did AI on their own cows and hadn't bought any animals for the last 20 years at least, so the question was where the Hell that cow had got itself infected. Authorities got involved and ran an investigation, and eventually figured it out:  One of the retired farm workers had got himself infected with bovine TB decades ago. Given that *M. bovis* has a urinary tropism in humans, the man had lesions in his kidneys, which made him shed TB in his urine. He was in the habit of relieving himself in the barn as people used to do back in the old days, and thus managed to infect a cow with bovine TB he had likely caught from another cow several decades prior.  Again, not directly related, but I though it was a fascinating piece of epidemiological detective work.   (Also, this is one of the many reasons why you shouldn't drink unpasteurized milk.)"

The moment we got home and let the 2 cats out of their cage, they started sniffing eachother and I could tell something was wrong. The senior immediately started chasing the younger cat and both of them clashed. This continued for 2 days everytime they spot eachother, the senior would always run and chase the younger. Until the senior eventually somehow recognized the younger, but the younger cat remained defensive, always looking around for the senior and frightened he may attack him again. It\u2019s been a week, my senior cat is depressed because he misses my younger cat. The younger cat is always defensive, hissing at my younger cat if he gets close to him. Always looking at the doors like he\u2019s anticipating the senior any time for an attack. Meanwhile the senior cat looks at the younger with sad eyes until eventually got tired and actually started to be afraid of him and hating to get close to the younger.

My dog is actually a parvo survivor. Recently, we got a litter of 8 week old malnourished pups in. We kept them for about a week to try get some weight on them. The day after we adopted them out, one of the pups got sick. The adopters brought him to the vet and he tested pos for parvo. So we called every adopter, explained to them what happened and the gravity of the situation. We offered to pay all vet bills, take the puppies back, etc. All of the pups but one were taken to the vet. The guy that got this puppy said that he was doing fine. He was eating, drinking, and playing. We told him that we suggest he takes him to the vet right away, he was convinced his puppy was fine. We told him that if the puppy stops eating or drinking, seems lethargic, vomits, or has diarrhea to bring him to the emergency vet right away. This was on Wednesday. On Saturday night the guy tries to post a picture of the dead puppy on our fb and says that we sold him a sick puppy and told him it would be fine. I called the manager and said someone needs to call him and get that pup's body, we bring them to the vet for cremation. She got a hold of the guy and he said that the puppy was just fine. He was eating and drinking, wagging his tail, and playing. Then he laid down and just quit breathing. Now from my own experience I called bullshit. I have NEVER seen a case where a 9 week old puppy showed no signs or symptoms and just died. He said he would bring the puppy in the morning, even though I offered to go pick it up that night. He brought the pup wrapped in a blanket inside a big tote. I wanted to check the pup over before I put him in the freezer..first thing I noticed, the horrible smell. It smelled like this pup had been dead for at least 24 hours, but I didn't know if parvovirus or his size would have an effect on that. Second thing was rigor had already passed. He was limp. This guy claimed the pup died 12 hours earlier. In my experience, none of this adds up to the story he is telling us..but I am not a vet. My question is this..Is this man's story plausible? Could the pup have been eating, drinking, and playing one minute and be dead the next with zero signs or symptoms? Would the size of the pup and parvo affect the decompostion rate and how fast rigor mortis subsides?\n\nAssistant:"

A few months ago, she said she would like thai cat for her birthday. I knew she wanted a pet, but I didn't expect her to want this particular breed of cat. But she loves anime and everything related to it, and I guess that's why she wanted something of a similar theme. Apparently she's ardent fan.  &#x200B;  Let's get back to the point. It's not a problem for me to find this breed of cat and give it away.

I just don't want it to somehow traumatize my younger sister if suddenly her cat dies from some disease. It will be a big blow for the child. I'm at a dead end right now.  &#x200B;  I need your help or at least some advice. Perhaps someone has or had this breed of cats. Tell me do they really have problems with morbidity? I read about thai cat that they have a huge number of diseases that they suffer from during their lifetime. I don't know if I should trust what I found, but it seemed very true to me. I'm sorry if I can't post information from other portals here, but my sister's birthday is very soon and I really need to know if I can still give this breed. I ask you not to comment that I am too trusting, that I believe any information on the Internet. I have not dealt with cat breeds and therefore the Internet is the only thing that has given me at least some information so far.

You can cut back a small amount more until she's ideal. Reduce her food slowly- you don't want to suddenly cut out a lot of calories. She'll be grumpier and it's not healthy. Weightloss in cats should be a slow, steady process. It may take months to a year or more depending on how overweight she is.

She doesn't seem to need much and I'm glad to lay down and scratch her ears. Lately I can tell she's in pain, even with her pills and helping her up the stairs I can feel her hips grinding, clicking and worse.      I just, I just don't know what to do anymore...      I know she's old and I'm not sure what I can do to help a dog at her age.      My family tells me it's time to say goodbye.      But I don't know how. She's been by my side basically my entire adult life.      I don't know how anyone here can help, but if you can, I'd deeply appreciate it.\n\nAssistant:"

I try to play with him more, but everytime we start playing with a toy he goes straight to the blanket, which is also weird.

A 2am visit to the emergency Vet, and they suggested pancreatitis. I wasn't convinced and requested an anti-emetic and sub-cut pain relief to last the 5 hours until my Vet opened.   Imaging confirmed a bowel obstruction and surgery ensued, with 1 length of towel from his stomach, through the length of his colon and well into his bowel. During this time he regurgitated and aspirated. He was hung off the table and the Vet was very concerned.   https://imgur.com/a/WrrgHWe  He was on the mend at home until yesterday morning when he was showing signs of infection. He had actually been seen by a Vet the previous afternoon and everything was progressing well. I work in the medical field, and got him to the Vet, fearing sepsis.   The staff at the vet have been incredible. They closed in the afternoon, with a vet and nurse staying with him until the vet went home after 9pm, the nurse did a 14 hour shift and swapped with another vet at midnight. The same nurse was back at 4am to swap again. This is not a 24 hour clinic.   They let my wife and I hang around with our dog, and we got him walking and urinating. All three of us were comforted by being allowed to be there.   While hanging around, I chatted with the Vet about my admiration for their role. They had experienced a very difficult day, with a routine surgery resulting in the loss of a dog. I understand resuscitation of this animal went for a number of hours and was unexpected by all. The vet was very upset by it.   My field of work has a long and dark history of suicide and mental health conditions, but we have coping mechanisms - both formal and informal. We also enjoy very defined relationships with our patients with the relationship starting and ending over the course of 1 - 2 hours. The impact of our role is still too much for many people.   I cannot fathom how hard vets and vet staff have it.   Clinics are either small with a limited number of practitioners, with long and drawn out relationships with patients who can't talk and owners who can't seem to listen. It's not like there is a bar that vets get to hang out in and debrief. They go home and think about their ongoing cases and get up in the middle of the night to continue working on them. It must be lonely and it must be consuming.   I understand the risks with my boy, and that's why I was so quick to get him back to care when his situation changed. My dogs are my world, and a big part of my coping mechanisms for dealing with my work related stressors. It doesn't matter if it is 3pm or 3am when I walk through the door... I always get greeted with love. When I am in a dark place, I have 2 labs ready to retrieve me. I can't express what loosing one unexpectedly would do to me.   That said, how can I possibly thank these guys for the work they do? How can I make their day a little better?\n\nAssistant:"

I'm not sure how to describe it but it's a bit lower pitch screechy meow and whenever I hear it I know it's go-time. This is always coupled with an erection if I check his downstairs.   I attempt to discourage this and eventually he'll plop down and start licking said erection. Occasionally there's a couple drops of fluid (semen? pee?) on it as well.   Since I've been quarantined I've REALLY started to notice it, oftentimes it's more than once a day. I'll be sitting on the couch and he'll jump on the blanket next to me and start going to town. It also happens when I go to bed (he'll jump in bed next to me and start kneading and doing the screech).  I first noticed it when I was going to bed (same situation described above) end of November 2018. And some probably relevant information is that I moved to a new apartment about a month before that.   I brought this up to the vet and while he was kinda stumped, he didn't seem too concerned. He was thinking it had something to do with him sensing a nearby stray cat, a cat in the building, or a cat that used to live in my unit since this behavior started a month after I moved in.

I recently lost my baby, he was my everything. I only have him in my shitty life. And we really have a extraordinary bond together. He was my shadow. I met him on his very first day where he was thrown away in a closed trash bad with his brothers and sisters, in a freaking rainy night in the middle of October. Only 2 survived. I fed him like a baby. From the moment he could walk, he was ALWAYS after me and it never stopped. I was the only one who could touch him, kiss him.. he was always right next to me. He literally sleep with me, under the covers lol. He was the sweetest soul ever, so kind with me. Yet he was a tiger with people he didnt like, especially vets lol.   I had to take the worse decision ever. But I wanted to stay by his side until the very end. They first gave him a shot to make him sleep. And during that, I stayed with him, talked to him, kissed him, touched him. His eyes were still open but the vet told me that he was sleeping, such shot make them keep their eyes open.  And I stayed with him when they did the last shot, the pink one.  I was still talking to him, petting him, kissing him and then I was told \"There. He's gone now.\" His eyes were still open which broke my heart even more. I stayed with him until I was told to leave.   By your own experiences, do you think he was aware that he was not alone??? Do you think that despite the \"sleeping shot\" he could still hear me in a way?? Feel me??  I dont know if it is like a full anaesthesia or if it is closer to what is a sleeping pill to us. I have no idea. But the thing is, I once read that animals tend to look for their owner during such time. Yet mine was really sick. They took him in another room to do the first \"sleeping shot\" and came right after it. Yet when I took him in my arms, I think he was already sleeping because of how hard he was fighting. Maybe I am wrong. Maybe he was .. sleepy but not sleeping yet, just that his body was already \"off\". I'm not fluent, I'm French so I hope everything is understandable   Do you think despite that, he knew that his mommy was right next to him???\n\nAssistant:"

Besides their continuous presence in the land there is extensive archeological evidence of their historical connection going back much further than just the 2nd century BCE (i.e. not just the Bible).  This doesn't negate Palestinian claims of long-standing, though it does pre-date them.  Your understanding of the history of the creation of Israel seems pretty minimal (not because you think it was immoral, which is an opinion held even by some very knowledgeable people, but rather because of your mistaken and insanely oversimplified version of it).  I recommend doing some more reading.  Be sure to read accounts that challenge your preconceptions, too.  Intellectual honesty is the best!  What sort of moral process are you looking for when the modern world recognizes a new state?  A UN sponsored plan to \"fairly\" partition disputed territory into 2 states?  Wait, that's exactly what happened (see the 1947 Partition Plan)!  But one side, the Arabs, rejected that plan and almost immediately after the plan passed in the UN a civil war broke out between the two sides with the British just sort of putzing around in the middle.  After the British left and the Mandate ended, Israel declared it's independence.  All the neighbors, realizing that there was booty to be had and recognizing that the locals weren't getting the job done, decided that they would invade, too.  In the end, Israel was still there.  Only it had got rid of the ridiculously untenable (from a military/defense standpoint) shape of the partitioned state.  The 1949 armistice lines weren't great but were better than the \"kissing corners\".  i.e. they were still almost undefendable from the West Bank.  In the process, lots of Palestinians were either forced to flee the fighting, were evacuated, were expelled, were killed, or moved out of Jewish controlled areas.  At this point your recommendation was what?  For Israel to say, \"Well your community has just tried to kill ours, and you still don't recognize our right to our own land, and you're still dedicated to ending our new state, and generally refuse to live under Jewish government, even in areas where Jews are the majority.  But come back and we'll just forget that all happened and be friends.\"?      \"We think we should have this land\" is maybe the most important guiding principle in the history of geopolitics.  In answer to your question, I would just ask how is Israel different from pretty much every single other country in the world?  The only differences I see are how long ago the conflicts were fought and that mainly the old ones were settled by one side completely annihilating/subsuming the other or exiling them (e.g. see how the Jews were forced out of Israel originally)."

It seems to me that removing Trump from office, whether by impeachment under the Emoluments Clause or declared \"unfit for duty\" under the 25th Amendment is a win/win/win scenario with no downside for anyone involved. Some details: **Trump himself**: He likes winning. His entire campaign was run not as an application for the most important job in the world, but as winning get the biggest contest in the world. And he did. Well done, Big Winner. And now that he has, he's left with a \"prize\" he seems not to really want\u2014a difficult, stressful job that exposes him to intense scrutiny and daily ridicule. He has no experience in government, no aptitude for collaborative leadership, and no inclination to public service (in fact I suspect the notion of being any kind of \"servant\" is anathema to Donald Trump). Even if removed from office, he can still say for the rest of his life, \"I did it. I won. I beat Crooked Hillary and all of the biased Mainstream Media.\" Let that thought keep him company and warm him in his dotage. I even think impeachment might play into his ego\u2014\"Think what I could have done if My Enemies hadn't stopped me\" kind of thing. **Pence**: \"But if we remove Trump, then we get Mike Pence as president!\" I hear you cry. He's definitely calling the shots right now, anyway. You all remember the call Trump made to John Kasich when he was looking for a VP\u2014Kasich could be \"in charge of foreign and domestic policy\", while Trump would be Making America Great Again (incidentally, this points right back to my item #1, Trump doesn't really want the job). Can you imagine Pence didn't get the same offer? As a bonus, Pence has some *actual experience* with governance and knows how political leadership is actually supposed to work. He's not going to govern by tweet and alienate our closest allies with ranting phone calls about \"terrible deals\". I'm willing to take my chances on President Pence. As someone once said, \"What the hell have you got to lose?\" **Congressional Republicans**: Aren't much happier with Trump than anyone else, I suspect. He makes the party look bad, and every time he does something outrageous, they are put in the unenviable position of having either to defend him, or break with the President. Of course, getting an impeachment through a Republican congress and convicted by a Republican senate may be impossible, but this is beyond the scope of this CMV which argues only that they would be *better off* without Trump in office. **Kushner, Conway, Bannon, et al.**: Even Trump's hangers-on, I believe, would be better off removed from public limelight and making scads of money working for the Heritage Foundation or going on tour to promote their latest ghostwritten book they got a six-figure advance on. **Deplorables**: Similar to point #1 above, they accomplished what they set out to do\u2014they memed Trump into the White House. Do they really have any interest in keeping him there? I just imagine /r/The_Donald all moving over to /r/The_Mike and picking up where they left off. **Vladimir Putin**: Won't Putin lose a valuable puppet in the White House? \"No puppet!

These are rational things that we need to keep in mind for this CMV to work properly.  Okay, let me give it a shot.

This is no secret. His campaign spoke to the right people at the right time, and he was elected.  To say, not even a month into this presidency, that he should be impeached is kind of spitting in the face of that. He has done nothing to be impeached for. It may seem like it. We may, at some point, see the evidence to do so. However, we are nowhere close to that right now. The EOs he's been signing may not sit well with you. I guarantee you that it is partially because of the media's hatred of him. 90% of the articles you will find about the heinous acts of DJT are conjecture. In other words, they are things that could potentially happen at some point. Whereas they may have a point, they are not providing factual information. They are providing opinions.  It is no secret that many MANY things we're hearing about are because of leaks inside the White House. Leaks are not congressional acts. They are people going behind the backs of the administration they're supposed to be working for and giving the media things to report on. Some are true. Some are false. However, it's important to understand that this has never happened in this way before. Had the media hated Barack Obama, and had his staffers and other White House employees leaked everything they could get their hands on, there is a possibility that the same amount of people would be livid and actually scared for their lives. Most of us don't understand the nuances of government. If you believe that DJT is the first person to give foreign leaders a hard time or sign EOs that don't add up to what you want them to, I suggest you do some more digging. This is not new. This is politics.  To blindly impeach a US president because he's not who you want him to be would cause irreparable damage to the future of our government. That is, in a nutshell, asking for Mob Rule to win instead of our democracy. Consider the implications of that! When will it stop? Will Mob Rule continue to dictate our entire lives? Will Mob Rule oust the good ones? Will we become so petrified to do anything because of what could potentially hurt us when the Mob doesn't like it? Will the media end up deciding what we should think? What we should say? Impeachment at this point would give the media such a boner that it would start onto something else. At some point, that something else will be something that you completely disagree with. As I said earlier, the consequences of this would be overwhelming.  I don't like DJT at all. But, until there is hard & sufficient evidence that he should be impeached, doing so would destabilize this country even more. Probably the entire world. It would show everyone that, as long as you're loud enough and as long as you're angry enough, you can get what you want. And that, friend, will backfire at some point. Big time."

This post is inspired by this news article: New Zealand's Smokefree legislation to ban people born after 2010 from ever buying tobacco. The news article mentions that one of the parties supporting the phase-out is the New Zealand Greens, which themselves support cannabis legalisation.  I personally support drug decriminalisation. It has been shown to reduce drug-related HIV and AIDS, drug-related deaths, and reduced social costs of responding to drugs - without the expected drawback of increasing drug use rates. In addition, anti-marijuana laws here in Australia have crippled the hemp industry, a crop which is known to be economically valuable and better for the environment compared to alternatives like cotton.  Back to the original news article, it says:  >Dr Verrall said non-Maori live eight years longer than Maori New Zealanders on average. Two and a half years of that gap is attributed to smoking.   >   >\"We want to make sure young people never start smoking \u2026 if nothing changes it would be decades till Maori smoking rates fall below five per cent, and this government is not prepared to leave people behind,\" she said.   >   >The government will consult with a Maori health task force in the coming months before introducing legislation into parliament in June next year, with the aim of making it law by the end of 2022.  I do not want more people to smoke and die from smoking. Indeed, back in high school PDHPE class, we were taught that a cigarette company executive once said \"*We don't smoke this shit, we just sell it. We reserve the right to smoke for the young, the poor, the Black, and the stupid.*\" - While the cigarette company executive was specifically referring to African-Americans, cigarette companies have also been targeting other disadvantaged minorities. I do not want to see the Maori get exploited by the cigarette companies into destroying their health, but I also believe that an outright tobacco ban instead of decriminalised status will only result in a situation like what we have in Australia, where we have an extremely high incarceration rate of Indigenous Australians and laws against drug use are inconsistently followed, to the detriment of Indigenous Australians.  To conclude, I believe in tackling substance abuse via policies which work. Outright prohibition and harsh punishments of drug use doesn't work (except among East Asian cultures); but decriminalisation coupled with harm reduction and education does.\n\nAssistant:"

A specific type of heavily marketed delivery system which causes cancer and other health problems which the drug itself does not cause.    No one is trying to ban nicotine, and it is readily available in other forms such as vape, gum, chew, etc.  People are trying to ban a specifically deadly consumer product which is used to deliver nicotine, but can be replaced by other, safer methods.    Certainly banning nicotine would be difficult and lead to lots of illicit use because it is so addictive, but there's no reason to think banning cigarettes won't work because people can just vape or chew to get their fix instead."

This shouldn\u2019t be political though.   I just turned 21. For the first time in my life I can CHOOSE to smoke and drink in California.   When I turned 18 I had the option to sign my life away to the military. The only reason this decision isn\u2019t for 21 is because the military requires young people to make a career in it. So that 18 figure isn\u2019t an adult, just a quota they have to fill.   That\u2019s why I believe you should be 21 to make MAJOR life decisions.

The mental health professional provides documentation\u2014in the chart and/or referral letter\u2014of the patient\u2019s personal and treatment history, progress, and eligibility.

If the first referral is from the patient\u2019s psychotherapist, the second referral should be from a person who has only had an evaluative role with the patient. Two separate letters, or one letter signed by both (e.g., if practicing within the same clinic) may be sent. Each referral letter, however, is expected to cover the same topics in the areas outlined below.  1. The client\u2019s general identifying characteristics; 2. Results of the client\u2019s psychosocial assessment, including any diagnoses; 3. The duration of the mental health professional\u2019s relationship with the client, including the type of evaluation and therapy or counseling to date; 4. An explanation that the criteria for surgery have been met, and a brief description of the clinical rationale for supporting the patient\u2019s request for surgery; 5.

My argument is that this is a bad idea, regardless of whether it is constitutionally sound. The power to pardon anyone of a crime, unchecked, seems like something that can be, and has been, abused.   Gerald Ford pardoned Nixon where there was a clear conflict of interest. Donald Trump has used his pardon to clear people who were guilty of crimes in which he was a direct beneficiary, or even possibly complicit.  In courts, judges are required to recuse themselves if they have a conflict of interest, and for good (and obvious, I hope) reason. I don't believe the president's power of pardon should be exempt.

The obvious exceptions are if the accused is determined to be a risk to the public or is unlikely to appear for their trial. But instead of deciding on a dollar amount of bail for suspects, judges should determine if the accused is either dangerous or a flight risk.

Aging is the breakdown of our body as we get older, which can cause a great deal of suffering and discomfort.  &#x200B;  I\u2019ve also seen some people say that aging is not a disease because it\u2019s a natural process that all living this go through, and that it\u2019s unavoidable. But these same problems apply to other things that we do consider diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s. If everyone on earth was 100% guaranteed to get cancer or Alzheimer\u2019s at age 80, they would still be diseases. In fact, people would probably try even harder to cure them since they would afflict all of the population, but the same can not be said of aging.   &#x200B;  Not only that, aging is almost certainly a greater evil than cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s or any other disease on the planet. 100% of people on earth are affected by aging, and they begin to feel its effects at around 30-40, then their entire lives. No other disease on the planet affects so many people for so long, only aging does. By a certain age, no matter how health or active an individual is (or used to be), they are going to end up in a wheelchair.   &#x200B;  Aging also increases the risk of getting and dying from many of the diseases that we are so focused on curing. The risk of getting cancer, Alzheimers, and just dying in general massively increases with age. Even if we are able to cure some of these deadly diseases (which would be fantastic) it would only increase life span by a small amount. Curing cancer would only increase our lifespans by 3 years. Diseases like cancer and Alzheimers should not be our priority when aging is going to kill all of us, whether we get these diseases or not.   &#x200B;  Finally, some might say that aging is incurable, and that focusing on curing cancer or whatever other disease is more realistic. However, research on aging has shown otherwise. Scientists recently reversed the epigenetic age of human cells that were 60 years old back to 25 using yamanaka factors. Other drugs and treatments like Rapamycin, NAD+, or senolytics therapy also show promise in reducing the negative effects of aging and even reversing it.   &#x200B;  If that isn't enough for you, large companies and billionaires like Googles Calico, Bezoses Altos Labs, and many others are getting involved. These are big players, and they are not stupid. They would not be giving out funding if there was not a real chance at curing or slowing aging.\n\nAssistant:"

On a personal level, I cannot fathom how such a person could reach adulthood without being institutionalised or requiring severe therapy in order to control these emotions.    Our emotions *inform* our actions, but they should never *control* them. I might get irritated at being cut off in traffic, but I would never start cursing out and gesticulating at the driver in front of me - because I rationally know that this will have zero effect in correcting the problem currently being faced. I might get pissed off when I start losing an online game, but I don't start abusing other players, or physically breaking my computer or punching a wall - because that would result in me materially losing, not gaining. So such a person who *does* do such a thing should be considered mentally disabled or ill, as they are taking actions that don't benefit them for only the most minor of catharsis - it's just another flavour of self-harm.    A simple Google search of \"anger mental illness\" backs up my views, with many anger-related mental health issues. It's even in the public consciousness, with movies like *Anger Management*. Yet somehow, domestic violence continues to be a problem - so somehow, these mentally ill people aren't being caught and somehow believe that violence is ever an acceptable response in an adult life. Even shouting matches still occur despite the fact that any rational adult should be able to carry out a calm conversation and either keep themselves under control, or withdraw if they feel they cannot.     So the short version of the CMV is: Being quick or accepting of violence and anger is already partially recognised as a mental disability/illness, but we're not doing enough to combat it. As a global society, we should be more active in teaching children that it's literally never OK in standard adult life (self-defence being the only exception), and if we ever see it in adults, we should be quick to recommend them to therapy in the long-term, and ask them why they feel anger/violence is acceptable in the short term when any sane person would know it's the wrong thing to do. _____  > *Hello, users of CMV!

It's horrifying, by every step is an entirely rational and deliberate action by the abuser to hurt and control their victim. So it really has no relevance to your argument.  More importantly, you need some sort of diagnostic criteria for these illnesses. Mental illnesses are usually diagnosed by mental health professionals identifying problems with thought processes and patterns. So what would those be? Mentally, the same thing is happening in their brain whether they contain the anger or lash out. Personally, I think that a genuine inability to control actions when angry is a lot rarer than you perceive it to be, and also a lot less criticized. You don't like it, but a great many people are completely fine with angry outbursts. They condone and excuse them, because they also have them, and so people are free to indulge.  It's the societal equivalent of a spoiled child. Doing a thing because they don't ever get taught not to do it.

Lockyer (2003, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit:  >\"All too many of the other great tragedies of history \u2014 Stalin\u2019s atrocities, the killing fields of Cambodia, the Holocaust, to name but a few \u2014 were perpetrated by armed troops against unarmed populations. Many could well have been avoided or mitigated, had the perpetrators known their intended victims were equipped with a rifle and twenty bullets apiece, as the Militia Act required here. See Kleinfeld Dissent at 578-579. If a few hundred Jewish fighters in the Warsaw Ghetto could hold off the Wehrmacht for almost a month with only a handful of weapons, six million Jews armed with rifles could not so easily have been herded into cattle cars. My excellent colleagues have forgotten these bitter lessons of history. The prospect of tyranny may not grab the headlines the way vivid stories of gun crime routinely do. But few saw the Third Reich coming until it was too late. The Second Amendment is a doomsday provision, one designed for those exceptionally rare circumstances where all other rights have failed \u2014 where the government refuses to stand for reelection and silences those who protest; where courts have lost the courage to oppose, or can find no one to enforce their decrees. However improbable these contingencies may seem today, facing them unprepared is a mistake a free people get to make only once.\"  This is why the right to own highly effective guns is important. Not for hunting, and not for sport, and not even for personal protection, but specifically for killing large numbers of people if that's what it comes down to. Everyone likes to respond with a sarcastic, \"oh, so where are these death camps or tyranny that you're so afraid of,\" but they miss the point. If the Jews in the Weimar Republic could've predicted the Holocaust before it happened, then no Jews would've stayed in Germany. As we all know, though, they didn't see it coming. That's why 6 million Jews, and 5-6 million gypsies, blacks, gays, the disabled/infirm, dissidents, and others, didn't survive through the reign of Hitler.  Will it happen in our lifetimes? Probably not. But it WILL happen eventually. Maybe not in our lifetimes, or our childrens', but what about grandchildren? Their grandchildren? And beyond us, what about the rest of the world? Can you say with complete confidence that there will never EVER again be a genocidal maniac in power anywhere on Earth? The kinds of policy you're advocating are common across the world. Will NONE of the Eastern European countries embrace totalitarianism again? Will NONE of the South and Central American nations go tyrannical? Will there never ever again be a genocide like the 1990s massacre in Rwanda?  You can only be truly free if the population has the ability to tell it's government \"no.\" The power to say no, and to enforce it, is the difference between a free population, and a population that is free at the convenience of their leaders. That's what millions of people across the world lost their lives proving. The Holocaust, the Holodomor, the Armenian genocide, the Rwanda genocide, the Khmer Rouge-led genocide...ALL of them required an unarmed population incapable of resistance. Unless you believe that no evil movement will ever happen ever again, at any point in history, you should support the right of the people to own all kinds of guns *specifically because* they can kill dozens of people per minute.  Edit: A lot of response. Instead of spamming the same response, I'll answer concerns that came up a lot.  >Regarding the power disparity between modern military and citizen with semi-automatic small arms:  Asymmetric warfare is possible. Just ask the North Vietnamese, the Afghanis, the Syrians, and Al Qaeda/the Taliban (the latter did it twice). A revolution wouldn't be fought in massive Revolutionary War or WW1 style battles, where two massive armies clash head to head. It would be fought like the way Al Qaeda or the NVA fought against us: small skirmishes and ambushes designed to do damage and run, seeking to destroy enemy morale and their populace's will to fight.   Also, this theory of potential warfare of a rebellion presumes that zero states secede and declare independence, forming a military of their own likely made up of defecting troops and equipment under their control (similar to how ISIS gained weaponry at first). In reality, rebel forces would have much the same weapons as the loyalist forces once the war actually got going. The peoples' small arms would be instrumental in getting the ball rolling, inspiring the first military/state leaders to defect.   >It wouldn't make a difference anyway, historically.  You're telling me that having 6 million armed Jews that all refused to go willingly wouldn't have changed anything? Seriously? That's a *massive* army. If we assume half are men, and half of those are fighting age, we're *still* talking 1.5 MILLION armed citizens. Not a whole lot, compared to what other nations had, but we aren't talking about a nation here. We're talking about a citizen revolt. We're talking about having to scrounge up enough men to fight a war on the Western front, fight a war on the eastern front, *and* fight constant skirmishes throughout the mainland and controlled territory as 1.5 million armed insurgents do their work. America shut down when a dozen or so dudes flew planes into buildings. Now imagine what Al Qaeda could've done with 1.5 million agents on American soil. That's basically what the Jews *could* have done, had they been armed.   I personally have a .270 hunting rifle and a 9mm handgun, with a total of around 40 rounds for the rifle and 200 for the handgun. That isn't unusual for gun owners. Had a quarter of the Jews had half of what I have, they would've had in the ballpark of as much ammunition as standard infantry had at the time. My point, basically, is that the Jews could have done some *major* damage had they been armed. The Polish and French resistances were extremely effective, and they didn't have that kind of man or firepower. The Polish resistance had a ton of high school kids, FFS. They stormed prisons to rescue POWs, they executed Nazi officials, and they constantly sowed fear into the Nazis by launching surprise attacks. The Nazis basically had to tie up tons of resources into subjugating the 500,000 Poles in the resistance. Triple that, and it's a genuine question as to whether that's manageable without leaving the whole army in Poland.  >But we have to do *something*.  What? If not total forfeiture of guns, then what is your solution? The reality is that freedom is a double-edged sword. There is no more safe place in the world than a padded isolation cell in a super max prison. Free food, constant security personnel presence, isolation from others who could harm you...and absolutely ZERO freedom. The most free place on earth is the middle of nowhere, where you can do whatever you want and there isn't a cop within 20 miles to write you a ticket for violating some random law. You can also be killed by some nutjob, or even an animal, and nobody will know, let alone be able to save you. Freedom is not free. There is a cost to society for the ability to choose how to live your life. IMO, the freedom to have the power to resist the government is more valuable than anything else I can imagine.   Something like 30,000 people die every year because people abuse vehicles. Maybe they drive recklessly, maybe they drank, maybe they are texting, or maybe they simply aren't good enough at driving to be on the road. Whatever the reason, 30,000 families have to bury children, fathers, and mothers who are killed as a result of cars. Should we ban the use of cars, and only allow people to have bicycles? Or, perhaps, the freedom to move across the country at virtually no risk and no cost in comparison to people just 100 years ago is so valuable that yes, it actually is worth the cost? It's all about how you weigh that. I value freedom and the independence of myself and my descendants more than the number of people killed by (arguably) \"preventable\" gun violence. When you get this issue wrong, the deaths go from being measured with four or five digits to being measured with one or two digits, followed by the word \"million.\" IMO, it isn't remotely worth any potential short term gains when you consider the inevitable. Forever is a long time for things to go to hell."

                "content": "\n\nHuman: CMV: If Biden wins the Democratic Primary, then Trump is basically guaranteed to be reelected in the General Election. This is coming from someone who watched the 2016 election while under 18, who was initially a Warren supporter for 2020 w/Sanders as a second choice, and now a Sanders supporter right before the Iowa Caucus.  To preference: I think any democrat (outside of Gabbard and Bloomberg) are leagues better than Trump in a multitude of ways. I personally consider myself a Social Democrat/Progressive, but I would vote Biden in a heartbeat in the general to make sure Trump is defeated. This CMV is to hopefully give me some peace at mind for Super Tuesday if Biden comes around and becomes the leading candidate for the primary, and to not become extremely anxious with the future.  But with that out the way, here are my main concerns regarding Biden:  -Policy wise, he's significantly more moderate than the rest of the candidates outside of Bloomberg. This makes me fear that hardcore sanders supporters who have polled to be more \"their candidate or no candidate\" will not turnout in the general, hurting the chances to beat Trump.  -Personality wise, I find that his frequent gaffes show a sense of age and mental decay, unlike other candidates within his age group. This makes me fear that he'll get destroyed in a debate vs. Trump just through being out of his element (if there even are general election debates). Not to mention the significant number of poor pictures of Biden with young uncomfortable girls. That could really damage his image.  -In regards to his history, the whole Hunter Biden / Ukraine situation screams to me as something similar to Clinton & her emails / benghazi / uranium one / insert other scandal here. Now, I don't think any of the above were illegal activities, nor even bad actions by Biden or Clinton. I find it to be a smear campaign by the GOP to discredit them early before the general election, with the idea that the GOP/Trump expected Biden to be the leading candidate to win the primary (and in turn have the most mud prepared to throw at him). So while a lot of this is false or lies, I am fearful that it will damage Biden's image enough in the general election to hurt his chances at beating Trump.  -In regards to the \"moderate vote\", I don't believe any democratic candidate have the means to sway someone who is pro trump. Trump's whole shtick is populism with a cult-like sense of connection. Biden's plan, to me, seems to be one of false hope. It's been previously studied that we're in a political war between urban and rural for democrats & the GOP, and no matter who will lead the primary, the results will be the same: Urban will overwhelmingly support the Democrat, Rural will overwhelmingly support Trump, with suburban leaning Democrat. But if Biden's whole plan is to focus on rural areas, then suburban areas will feel like they're getting ignored and forgotten, which to me seems like a repeat of 2016 all over again.  Now with this in mind, compare this to what would happen in the General if Sanders won.  -Policy wise, the only people who would potentially not vote for him are economically conservative ideologies, i.e. those who would already support Trump in the general anyways. Rank in file democrats would choose \"blue no matter who\", and even more moderate or conservative people might still vote for Sanders over Trump, see Joe Walsh for an example. Then combine that with Sanders supporters having their preferred candidate, there won't be any issue with voter turnout in the general as \"bernie or bust\" wouldn't happen. Sure he calls himself a socialist, but to be fair Trump would call any democrat a \"socialist\" due to how much the overton window has shifted in the US.  -Personality wise, he is as sharp as a tack. Now sure, there might be some damaging quotes that Sanders have made in the past (castro for example), but they are more based around policy than personality, and I feel the general election will be more based around personality than policy (i.e. populism).  -Historically, Sanders has been consistent and has already admitted to past mistakes or votes. So overall, I don't think Sanders would be hurt by his history. Now sure, there might be some topics of Russia attempting to support Sanders, although I find this to be more along the lines of spreading chaos and division rather than actually supporting Sanders' policies (he's already condemned russia for this, and supports sanctions on russia as well as SA and other notable countries in similar situations).  -In regards to the \"moderate vote\", like before, I don't think this will be much of an issue as the vast majority of moderates would already be supporting Trump over any democrat. But even then, I still think Sanders would have a better chance than Biden to potentially sway voters over in this isle, as due to Sanders' similarly populist appeal akin to Trump, in which he can likely grab some strong support from lower-politically educated voters.  So please, help me change my view, or at least give me the comfort that if Biden does win the primary / super tuesday, he can still likely beat Trump.\n\nAssistant:"

Biden was second in command during 8 of the best years in recent history, and his policy proposals are just a slightly more progressive version of happened then.  I can understand liking Sanders more than Biden. That's based on policy. But actually disliking Biden is ridiculous to me. If progressive Democrats particularly disliked Hillary Clinton, fine. Maybe she was uniquely corrupt or horrible to Sanders supporters. But Biden did nothing wrong except run against Sanders. I mean even Elizabeth Warren is getting an insane amount of hate for not being Sanders, and her policy positions are very similar to his.  Biden was VP during the Obama administration. He wasn't a joke like on the show Veep. Obama genuinely considers him a close friend and confidante. I mean he surprised Biden with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. That's not something he needed to do at all. And for the conspiracy minded folks out there, if Obama was just trying to set the Democrats up for another win, he would have given one to Hillary Clinton while she was running. The only reason he didn't endorse Biden from the start was because he wanted to avoid giving the impression that Biden was being selected by establishment Democrats. But now that Biden is starting to pull in so many votes from regular people (he's currently winning the popular vote), it's changing the dynamic.  I think everyone is seeing this election though the most cynical lenses possible. That's the Trump-effect. But I genuinely think that once the dust settles, Democrats both progressive and moderate will support Biden. Not because they have to in order to beat Trump. But because Biden is a good person and a great leader.  As a final point, Biden is still marginally beating Trump in polls despite the fact that the Democratic Party is so split. If it actually unites the way I think it will, then Biden is going to win in a landslide."

I recognize that this argument is likely to anger people who have made a lifelong commitment to selfless public service in the armed forces, but numbers are numbers: President Trump asked for a 10% increase in FY 2018 to $639 billion. The Congress eventually obliged with an 18% bump to $696 billion. Our military budget is more than the next seven nations combined budgets, per the Pete Peterson foundation. Like our healthcare system, we spend outrageously and for what? Safety? Global order? Respect? Are any of these actually ours at all, thanks to borrowed (at interest) and then spent billions?  TL;DR: Our economy is addicted to spending tax dollars we borrow to finance a war machine nobody needs.

There\u2019s no point to life inside a cage with 24/7 psychological torture.    Let's assume your juvenile is 16 years old, and they are sentenced like you say for 20 years. When they emerge they will be 36 years old.   That feels OLD when you're 16, but it really isn't very old. That person could reasonably expect 40-50 more years of healthy living and to make use of their new freedom.   Now, can everyone take advantage of these decades of freedom? No, many people cannot. They are broken by their experience in prison, they have no meaningful skills, they have no capacity to re-engage with the outside world. They are less likely to find work. These are real challenges.  So, let's accept all of these as premises. This is the situation.  What's the solution to this problem?  We have your option. Let people kill themselves in prison. While this technically solves the problem, it does so in the same way as cutting off your leg resolves a sore toe.   What's an ideal solution to the problem?  The released prisoner *can* re-engage with society, and can make a productive and happy life for themselves.   Do we achieve this by letting them kill themselves? We do not. And so, it's clear your solution - although it does solve the superficial issue - isn't ideal.   To get to the ideal situation will require investment in great resources and environments for (especially juvenile) prisoners, helping them earn qualifications and build skills. Making it easier to do it than to not, in fact, as much as possible. We try to smooth pathways for them out in the world where there are jobs with willing employers available for ex-offenders so they can earn money and begin to build a life. We build a support network around them that helps them re-integrate and re-start their lives.  Is any of this easy? Absolutely not. It's much harder than letting everyone top themselves in prison.

                "content": "\n\nHuman: CMV: The upcoming Jubilee celebrations marks the 10 year cycle of state institutions, particularly Britsh media, forcefeeding us - the British general public - the idea that the class system and aristocracy is intrinsically part of the British identity and its bullshit. I've lived on this great island for 32 years and happy to be British for reasons such as security, culture, its landscapes and the opportunity to have a good life. The Queen has barely registered on the periphery in those 32 years apart from her face being printed on the money I buy stuff with. British media have an unhealthy obsession with the Royal Family, having a frenzy over something as innocuous as a rope cutting ceremony up to scandal, which the British press are known to pounce on and exacerbate. I have no interest in any of this and nor does anyone I encounter in my day to day. Its not talked about by the water cooler. Young Mums don't gather to gossip about it over coffee. The majority of us don't give a shit about the Queen and her family.   I am working class and have moved to and lived in different British cities mostly in the North that are very multicultural, economically rich and poor, depending on the area and usually have a rich historical heritage and history of culture and art that are still thriving to this day. I now live in Bristol in the economically richer South, a city that ticks the same boxes. Things like multiculturalism, our musical and historical heritage and nightlife I identify as being British in my lived experienced. But then, other countries can latch on to the same things to paint a picture of their national identity which makes it confusing. For many of us, British identity is ambiguous and hard to define but I think part of it is rooted in our history and culture.   The type of people on British TV right now who claim that the Queen \"does alot of good for the country\";  a collection of media pundits, Tory politicians, church-goers, over 60's, majority white commentators from rural towns who claim this without pointing to anything tangible, outside of representing our country in international ceremonies. The media is highly complicit in forcing this agenda on us incessantly, but I believe that most of the regular folk interviewed who are for the Queen earnestly believe she does do alot of good and they view the Royals very positively. Part of the reason they believe this however, I fear, is to supplement that large blank space in the middle of our sense of national identity with the Royals which are the ultimate symbol of class divide and aristocracy.   How are these endearing qualities to be proud of when defining our sense of nationality? The Royals have had little to no experience of my lived experienced of being British and if the media didn't ram them in our faces in almost every newsycle, the majority of us would feel even more detached from them and possibly pay more attention to public money going towards Jubilee celebrations.   TLDR: I've lived in Britain in 32 years and the Royals have had no influence on my experience of Britain. British media are highly complicit in ramming the Royals down our throat from the mediocre, to scandal, to outwardly pro-Royal agenda. British identity is hard to define and we supplement that with the Royals which are the ultimate symbol of class divide and aristocracy which is troubling.\n\nAssistant:"

It's not easy to show the effect a monarch has, and its effect will probably wane a bit when your famous Queen Elizabeth goes out of office. But there certainly is an effect to your international standing, simply by having the monarchy.  Are there things wrong with the monarchs of yours and my country? Yeah definitely. Should that be addressed? Yeah duh. But I believe they do have a net positive effect on the country still."

I believe that the winner take all system is problematic when determining the amount of electoral votes that go to the presidential candidate. This system leads to swing states, which hold disproportional power over the elections compared to their actual population. A way to remedy this is to change the way the votes are given out. This is the percentage-based system:  Let's say that State A is traditionally Republican/Democrat with a consistent 75% majority. The electoral votes can be easily predicted to go to one party. But under my system the minority party would receive 25% of the electoral votes.   A couple of effects would occur from this:  Politicians would have to campaign in every state in order to consolidate their votes, \"diluting\" the amount of money they bring to the elections.   The amount of \"wasted\" votes is minimized. If State A goes Republican/Democrat, then all of those who vote for the minority accomplished nothing under winner-take-all.  As a *possible* effect: Voter turnout increases. If people know that they don't have to beat the majority anymore, they might vote more.  Negative effects:  Since the amount of money entering politics is diluted, the amount of money that needs to be raised for any politician to run is significantly higher. However, I believe that since the amount of money has already reached incredibly high levels (Almost $1b spent by each party), this bar already exists.    _____  > *Hello, users of CMV!

Curiously, you don\u2019t see advocating that the votes in Texas be divided up in the same fashion.   I\u2019d prefer if we abolish the Electoral College altogether. This country has to get out of this imbecilic mindset that just because the Founding Fathers  proposed something meant that it was, and much less **is**, a good idea.   The Electoral College places far too much power in the smaller, sparsely populated states. Each state will always have a minimum of three Electoral Votes, or about .56% of the total. This, even though Wyoming constitutes .175% of the population of the United States. That means the weighted average vote of a Wyoming voter is worth substantially more than someone from California. Their 55 votes represent 10.2% of the electoral college while constituting 12.1% of the general population.   Add up the small states like Alaska, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, South Dakota, North Dakota, etc., and not only do you have these people receiving absolutely disproportionate representation in the antiquated Senate, but you\u2019ve given them substantial say in the election of the President.   It\u2019s outrageous. The interests of a geographic work of fiction are absolutely irrelevant. The interests of the *people* are real and matter. The only fair to address this is the abolish the Electoral College and elect the President strictly on a basis of the popular vote.   Of course, since the smaller states are permitted to exercise their will over the more populous, economically and educationally productive ones through the Electoral College (and the Senate) and given that A.) The consent of two-thirds of Congress plus three-fourths of the states or B.) a Constitutional convention called by two-thirds of the states is necessary to amend the Constitution to change this, it\u2019s not going to happen."

Just by chance, I watched a debate video that pulled me out of this bubble and let me see what life is like on the other side.  The group in this video held the stance that Russia has already essentially won and all that is left is the questions of how big their win will be and how long Ukraine will stubbornly fight a lost war.  I figured I'd take this discussion to CMV because if I am just being blind in my beliefs, I'd rather know about it now than painfully see it fall apart over a period of months of defeat.  My belief is that Russia does not have a clear and obvious path to victory based on the following.  1. Their rate of advance in December is about 100 km\\^2.  At that rate it would take them about 10 years just to regain the land lost in the Kharkiv offensive.  So for all the chest beating Russia is doing over their advances in Bakhmut, they're not simply running over the Ukrainian military. 2. Ural crude oil (the oil Russia sells) is going for $55/barrel.  This is down from the peak of around $111 and even down from the pre-war price of $77.  Natural gas is around the pre-war price.  With about 1/5th of the Russian economy depending on these products and the general sanctions hitting all other industries, Russia is going to have to dip into their war chest as their revenues fall sharply while military costs spike. 3. The West has already seized half of Russia's war chest.  When sanctions were put into place, $350 billion was frozen by western banks.  Clearly Putin had not planned on this happening nor did he anticipate the sanctions or embargo of Russian fossil fuels.  Feel free to correct me if I'm overstating the importance of these three things because they are what led me to my conclusion.  With Russia far from military victory, their economy being strangled, fossil fuel prices (specifically Russian fossil fuel prices) falling, and with their initial funds for the war cut in half immediately when the war started, Russia economically is bound to collapse.  If it weren't for these economic factors, I do think Russia could be pigheaded enough to be able to eventually wear Ukraine out and bring about favorable peace negotiations, but with the economic clock ticking down and everyone being fully aware that time will eventually run out for Russia, all Ukraine and the west have to do is wait them out.  Of course, I don't think Ukraine and the west are simply planning on waiting them out.  They have their own plans for helping to militarily press Russia, but I feel like that is a bit of an unknown.  Maybe Ukraine can achieve more victories or maybe they can't.  That's why I don't hinge much of my convictions on how military fortunes go in the coming year.  Lastly, to be clear, I'm not saying Ukraine's victory is a foregone conclusion either.  I don't want people getting the wrong idea and trying to make me defend just how easily I think Ukraine will win, because I don't think it is that easy.  Even if Russia goes bankrupt, that doesn't necessarily mean the fighting is over.  It just means Russia's chances of winning are over.  They can still throw millions of people armed with bows and arrows to their death over a period of years and maybe even go as far as the use of nuclear weapons.  Russia's defeat doesn't automatically mean Ukraine's victory as odd as that sounds.  Russia's defeat could mean everyone loses.  The point of my argument is that I believe Russia is on a trajectory to lose and anyone who thinks Russia is on the cusp of victory, I'm really interested to see how that perspective is supported.\n\nAssistant:"

Is this a strawman opinion only genuinely shared by a handful of those drinking the kool-aid?  The only person I've heard of that has this opinion is Peter Zeihan as far as I can tell, and lately his opinion has drifted from that original analysis. I think especially at the beginning of the war when Russia had air superiority and were closing in on Kyiv, that may have been the opinion.   But now? Even Russian media figures have put on the brakes on an inevitable victory. The failures of the Russian military so far, especially in light of Ukrainian counter-offensives, makes a sure victory for them dim every day this war goes on. And not even the Russian propagandists can hide it anymore."

I'm a progressive voter who supported Ilhan Omar and Elizabeth Warren (I'm in MN). I have a masters degree and about $20K in student loan debt. However I don't understand why canceling student loan debt is a progressive policy that is being championed by the likes of Warren, Bernie, AOC, and others. Change my view that this is a policy that won't address underlying issues with student debt but it will further divide class lines.  I understand that total student loan debt (>$1.5 trillion) has now surpassed total credit card debt (<$1trillion) to become the second largest form of debt in America (after mortgages). I acknowledge that's a concern. This has been driven by increases in the costs of higher education, increased/eliminated caps on borrowing for students and parents, the rise in for-profit colleges, the increasing number of people attaining college and especially graduate school, and more.  However, only about 1 in 8 Americans has student loan debt and the average amount is about $32K. While I understand that some people drop out of college and get the debt without the benefit, that is not emblematic of people who have student loan debt in general...an individuals who graduate college tend to make significantly more than those who don't (\\~$75K/year vs $45K/year). Additionally there are income-based repayment plans for student loans that are an option which tie your repayment to your discretionary income and forgive anything you have left after a set number of years. Why should we cancel, on average, $30K in student loan debt for citizens who make, on average $30K more per year than non-college graduates?  So, again, why is canceling student loan debt seen as a progressive policy being championed by the likes of Warren and Bernie and AOC, etc?  Someone change my view that it would be more progressive and effective strategy to:  1. Address underlying issues causing the increase in student loan debt. Simply canceling student loan debt simply resets our debt back towards zero but then it will start accumulating all over again. Congress needs to address how we got in this situation. 2. Give every American a big ol' check. If someone wants to spend their big bailout on paying off a bunch of student loan debt, that's their prerogative. And if I want to spend it paying down credit card debt first, that's my choice based on my biggest need. And if a low income family wants to use it to buy a car to have reliable transportation to a better job, that's their opportunity to get ahead.  If we could lift every American out of poverty and provide universal healthcare and check a whole lot of other boxes then I'd be all for moving down the list to eventually forgiving student loans...but I don't understand or support why it's an issue that is getting so much attention now.  Forgiving student loans will disproportionately help middle and upper class Americans while providing no benefit to our most impoverished and marginalized citizens, and it will do nothing to address the systemic issues that created the debt in the first place. Change my view.\n\nAssistant:"

Friendships come with two obligations: one, that you're going to hold your friend's interests above others, and two, that you'll try your best to fulfill these interests, reasonably. Of course, this puts a damper on your own autonomy, but it comes with a cool benefit; that you have a friend who'd also do these things for you.  So morally, would it be right to snitch on your friend? You can take a utilitarian approach to it and argue that hey, maybe the cost of snitching on them will be much greater than the good generated if you didn't, so you should - but you're committing a crucial act here: you're betraying your friend. And then you can start to think about, okay well, I'm sure sometimes they would deserve it and yada yada yada.

What would change my view would be a moral argument that the passive income is far more deserving than the 90+% of the public who primarily rely on their wages to live on rather than owning assets.\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " This argument always comes up in a bull market. Passive income comes from risking your money on an asset like a house or a stock. Earned income comes from working. If you get fired, you lose the opportunity to make new money. But you don't lose your existing money. If the stock or housing market crashes, you can lose almost all your money in safe investments and more than all your money in risky ones (where you have debt). You can lose a decade's worth of wages in a single day. You can lose a lifetime's worth of savings in a few months. This isn't a question of if, but when. It has happened many times in the past century. It hasn't really happened for about a decade. There was a short COVID crash last year, but the stock market quickly rebounded. But many people lost their homes and life savings in 2008.  A common counter-argument is that rich people will still be fine after losing most of their money. That's true. If you have 100 million and lose 99 million, you still have more than enough money to live on. But the problem with your argument is that you are forgetting that the same tax split applies to regular people too. Many regular people lost their homes and retirements not because they lost their jobs but because they lost all their investments/savings. It doesn't matter if you are rich or poor. Losing your existing money and the opportunity to make new money at the same time is worse than losing your chance to make new money, but keeping all your savings/investments. That's why the tax rate is lower on passive investments than wages.  Society needs people who are willing to lend out their money to other people in the form of loans and investments. People hate risking their money unless they are promised more money in return. This is why investing exists. The safer a source of passive income is, the less money it pays. The more likely you are to lose all your money overnight, the more it pays.  In fact, this fear of loss is a big reason why most people own very few stocks. The risk of losing everything is too high, and if you aren't rich to start, you can't afford to buy risky things no matter how much money they might pay. So poor people are forced to rely on wages rather than assets to survive, and because in the long run assets tend to make more money, they remain poor. In this way, you have the solution backwards. The solution isn't to make assets more expensive to buy and tax wages less. It's to reduce taxes on passive investments even more so the risk-reward ratio becomes more favorable for poor people. You can even go further and pay people to invest. This is already being done via employee matches in retirement accounts. Beyond that, this is partly the idea behind universal basic income.  Ultimately, humans are cerebral, social animals, not beasts of burden. We shouldn't be propping up wages at a time when a robot can do our job 100x better, faster, cheaper, and greener than we ever could. Instead, we should do everything to make sure that everyone owns a piece of the robot. That means reducing the taxes on passive income producing investments so people are more willing to buy them. It might even mean simply paying people a UBI.  Humanity's economic and ethical framework changed when we went from hunter-gatherer times to farming times. We started to care about land ownership and had to invent a whole framework around that. We ended up with lords and colonists and serfs and slaves. Then things changed again when factories were invented. We ended up with capitalists and workers. Now the technological revolution is changing things again. Workers are disappearing. All we're going to have is machines/robots/computer algorithms and the capitalists who own them. The sooner we can ditch the outdated economic and ethical frameworks and move to the new ones, the better."

To condense my argument for this position, here are some highlights of what supports such an argument:  - Children this decade have the most access to technologies that were completely inaccessible to similarly aged children last decade.  - Free to Play games use Skinner-box psychological exploits to garner money from people who have an addictive personality (e.g., Whales) and children via. the means of pester power (which is outlawed in countries under the EU).  - A lot of mobile Free to Play games use cartoon series to appeal to children, which fall in line with the previous reason and exploiting pester power to gain money from parents.  - Most YouTubers with younger audiences are beginning to be sponsored by mobile Free to Play companies.  - The M Rating would deter parents from allowing their child to even play the game, thus giving the strategy of using micro-transactions a very negative stigma in regards to making a profit.  So summing everything up above, the M Rating would be due to the risk of having children develop an addicting personality (e.g., the reason why casinos only allow people 21 years and older to gamble) and would benefit both them and even many others so that these companies would have a reason not to use such a strategy.  So any of you are welcome to try and change my perspective on this issue, and I certainly hope we can have a conversation about this issue. Bear in mind this isn't an argument to ban Free to Play games as a whole, but more having the ESRB crack down and rate these games properly.\n\nAssistant:"

Whether we like it or not its becoming a standard in the industry (character passes, cosmetic skins and costumes, extra missions, etc.) We arent placing an M rating on all of those games.   Generally speaking, microtransactions like in NBA 2K20 (a literal slot machine graphic) and Star Wars Battlefront 2 (rewards that made you deal more damage, therefore making you better than someone who doesn't spend) is what needs to be marked somehow. Be it \"Simulated Gambling\" under the ESRB guidelines which consistitutes an Adult Only rating or something brand new.

Right so clearly this reply isn't appropriate in *all* discussions about sexual assault. If someone makes a post on 2XC about how they were raped, it would be fairly disrespectful and counterproductive to interject with a top-level reply: \"not all men.\" But if in some thread further down that same post you have people making massive generalizations about men it's totally fair to offer up the \"not all men\" correction.  And it is just that: a correction. And an accurate one. I can't really understand why people take such an issue with it. It's not \"derailing\" the conversation about sexual assault to offer up an accurate correction. If anything it's just making the discussion more accurate.  I'm operating under the assumption that we all agree it's bad to generalize large groups of people, simply because it's hard to be accurate when making statements about what broad groups of people are like. If we're all on board with that when it comes to, say, Muslims, or blacks, it makes even more sense to not generalize men since they're a much larger group.  And yet for some reason \"not all men\" has become a laughable meme in feminist communities. Look at that comic. The guy is obviously meant to look like the asshole in that situation, but look at what he is interrupting: a woman who started her sentence \"I'm just sick of how men...\" and it leaves you to fill in the blank. There's pretty much no way she could possibly complete that sentence that would be accurate. Sexually assault people? Only some men do that. Catcall? Only some men do that. Pee standing up? Again, \"not all men.\" The purple-haired individual in the comic is trying to make a broad, sweeping generalization about nearly 4,000,000,000 people. Nothing she could possibly say there would be accurate, so it's fair to correct her on her false generalization.  What I find baffling about this pushback against \"not all men\" is that when this kind of generalization is applied to other groups the same people who hate on \"not all men\" would often be perfectly accepting of such a correction, or wouldn't have been caught making such a bad generalization in the first place. The incel community is infamous for their generalizations of women, and something tells me that when women, particularly feminists, read the toxic shit they say they'd have no problem with a \"not all (or even most) women are like that.\" Or could you imagine that purple-haired, shaved sides, pierced-up feminist in the comic starting her sentence: \"I'm just sick of how blacks...\" or \"I'm just sick of how Muslims...\" or \"I'm just sick of how gays...\" No. Because she wouldn't be caught dead making generalizations about minority groups like that, and if for some reason she did make those generalizations she wouldn't object to anyone pushing back.  r/menkampf is like a case study for that kind of swapping out of groups to see how statements hold up. The sub is great. If you're unfamiliar, the concept is that you find posts, comments, tweets, articles, etc. that are bashing on men/straights/whites/cisgenders and then swap out that group for \"Jews.\" As the sub's name would suggest, when you do this you very frequently end up with a revision that sounds like something Hitler could've said, like \"all Jews are trash\" or that they \"burn faster.\" Bonus for someone swapping out \"men\" in a \"not all men\" meme for \"Muslim.\" And the feminist choking out the \"Muslim\" dude in the comic, whispering that while they know it's not *all* Muslims, it's too many, and Muslims being offended over generalizing statements about Muslims makes them part of the problem, encapsulates my position perfectly.  I don't get it. \"Not all men\" is just an accurate correction. That's it. If you end up in a position where it's necessary for someone to make that correction, don't get mad at them - instead, be a little more self-critical of your own ideology and how it led you to make such broad, inaccurate statements about billions of people. And then swap it out for something like \"I'm just sick of how gays spread HIV\" or \"I'm just sick of how blacks commit so many violent crimes\" or \"I'm just sick of how women are gold-digging whores.\" If swapping out \"men\" for some other group and \"\\[issue; e.g. sexual assault, mansplaining, etc.\\]\" for some other issue that group is known for makes you sound like a racist, xenophobe, homophobe, or misandrist, it's quite likely the original statements you made about men was misandrist, and you should reevaluate your ideas rather than get mad over people correcting you.  I've only engaged with people on this topic a few times, so I'm hoping one of you can explain how and why it's such a bad thing to offer up what is, in my view, just an accurate correction in a conversation.

However, temporarily pursuing equity and treating people differently based on their color/ sex in order to combat preexisting oppressive racism and sexism to push towards equality of outcome (slavery reparations, quota hiring, etc) may be a good idea.  The fundamental flaw of modern leftists like BLM, feminists, etc, is that they hold equity (equality of outcome) as the highest goal. Due to fundamental differences between men and women, and differences in culture between ethnic groups, in a hypothetical scenario where treatment of all individuals both individually and systemically is fair and equal, differences in outcome will persist due to personal choice due to the individuals and their inherent characteristics.  The disparities we see today, for example Asian men leading in income, native and white men leading in suicide rate, and black women having the lowest suicide rate, may be be due to racism and oppression rather than individual choice/characteristics.  While BLM and leftists in general want to move society away from racism and oppression they won't know when to stop cause they'll claim sexism exists until soldiers are 50% female (never gonna happen, its biology), and they'll claim racism exists until all the effects of historical differences regarding socioeconomic status between ethnicities (higher income in Jews, Asians, etc) have been completely smoothed out by time.  If you know anything about history you know that Jews are going to continue being among the richest people in the US for a long time regardless of whether antisemitism is eradicated, and sadly the opposite is true of african and native americans regardless of whether racism is eradicated. Even if antisemitism is absolutely purged from society the generational wealth of Jews will continue persisting for many more hundreds of year as it already has.  Likewise, even if hypothetically all racism ends, the generational wealth of BIPOC people will take a very long time to reach a level that is representative of the general population. That's literally what generational wealth MEANS, it means it takes many generations (centuries) to accumulate.  Maybe for clarities' sake I could rephrase what I'm saying to be that even if all bias and prejudice and stigma and unconscious bias etc was completely and entirely eliminated from society there would still be differences in outcome between men and women and different races, due to biological differences between men and women and cultural/historic factors between ethnicities.  Why is this a worthwhile conversation to have? Because: equity is a false ideal, and: equality of opportunity with a combination of eradicating conscious and unconscious bias, is the only way to go, contrary to what SJWs say.

Basically, it's enough for the family to live in poverty.  This would **not** vary by location.  However, the government would offer a 1 time moving allowance for people stuck in expensive locations.  This would help for the following reasons:  1) Rural towns and locations wouldn't see the brain drain and may start to make a recovery  2) Small Business owners would have less at stake because they have a guaranteed income   3) Outsourcing for low wages would end because the companies can now pay lower wages for certain jobs (let's be honest, some jobs aren't worth $7.25).  4) Poor workers no longer have to work shitty hours in terrible conditions to survive meaning **they can refuse shitty jobs that only pay $7.25**.  5) \"Welfare queens\" who don't work because they make more money being unemployed could get back to work part-time because they would receive the government money regardless of their employment and they would like the extra money.  6) Child support and the whole \"father by choice\" debate would end.  Child support would no longer exist.  7) People would be able to carefully select jobs as well as decide if, not only where, they would like to work. This would lead to a much more competitive job market.   8) Because only profits on companies are taxed, industries that are currently impossible in America due to a high minimum wage would spring up.  Examples include manufacturing jobs where you just watch a machine and tell people when it's going wrong, and basic call center jobs.  I know many are gonna argue that people are just going to be lazy and not work.  Although this is a possibility, there is mounting evidence that it will actually increase the employment and productivity.  We will know more when the first state to try this (Ontario) implements this and lets it run for a year or two.  For now, I will not accept this argument in any form.    _________  > *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

The parents.  Does it? There's tons of misinformation floating around about healthy eating that often gets pushed by the media and it's only gotten worse with social media. Food today is often much denser in calories than it used to be and companies advertise junk food directly to children on tv and with cartoon characters on their products. Kids are often eating unhealthy meals at schools, and may be eating unhealthy meals and a friend's house, at grandma's or using their allowance to purchase junk food. It's very easy to think your kid is eating right when they are not, and I don't think we've set up the infrastructure as a society to cast parents as child abusers for unhealthy diets when media, food companies and schools often have blame to share."

I am not making the argument that the wealthy make better parents than the poor. I am saying that such a system will help weed out parents that cannot support a child (ex druggies, people that cannot afford to have one) and therefore will reduce the burden that kids (and future adults) that have not been raised well. A poor couple who is able to reject the money will show that they they place a significant value on their child  and will be just as likely to care for their kid as a wealthier couple. But when you compare those who can afford a child to those that cant, obviously the those that have more money will be able to better support one. Not only does this prevent the financial effects that a child places on a couple but will help end the cycle of poverty that continuously effect generations.  The burden of a one time lump sum to those that accept the offer will be much less than paying for the social support systems to take care children in poverty and the families that will be kept in poverty due to having a child. In addition, I believe he amount of various crimes will be reduced in this country (I dont have a source for this).  I believe that every person has the right to have kids and therefore such a program will be VOLUNTARY. Those who chose to take the money will be doing so on there own free will and must be a least 18. Yes people will change their minds later, but if they cannot see this changing then they most likely will not be able to have the planning need to raise a child.   Yes, there will still be parents who dont take care of their kids, and such a system is not designed to eliminate bad parents. But hopefully, it will reduce them.

It wouldn't be hard for a Republican operative or pro-Trump foreign actor to start posting this stuff, or just coordinating upvotes when it does happen.

Some of those emails brought to national attention coordination between Clinton's campaign and the Super PAC \"Correct the Record\". This only avoided FEC regulation due to CTR not running direct ads, just a massive paid astroturfing campaign on social media.   I just thought it was kind of funny to complain the criticism received about this, in a post worrying about potential astroturfing. There is likely some astroturfing on all sides, but I think far larger numbers of people have some deeply seated concerns about Biden, than are trolls with malintent.   I've seen far more \"Vote Blue No Matter Who\", or \"Bernie's unelectable\" or \"BernieBros are so hostile\" posts that I was suspicious of than \"Bernie or Bust\" posts and I think you are mischaracterizing those few posters to some extent.  I've seen two types of Bernie or Bust posts. One is a young or non-voter that in a rare moment really liked a candidate and felt rare hope for the future direction of this country. With Biden gathering near universal support from establishment democrats and other candidates, and Bernie's near certain defeat these new voters feel legitimately discouraged and are often seeking advice or simply expressing frustration.  The other is a more committed progressive that's wondering if supporting a third party or even actively help Trump win wouldn't be better for the potential future of the Democratic party and the policies it endorses. I think these are both fair points to question, although I disagree with both, with the exception for voting third party in safe states.  > I'm not going to say at this point that I'm sure that these is a false-flag interference campaign on Reddit to sow division on the left,    You do seem to be heavily implying this. Rather than making a more generous assumption about peoples motivations.  >Biden is just as bad as Trump   This is the only one I've personally seen from the types of Bernie or Bust posts you've listed. I think more commonly its seen as a \"Biden and Trump are both terrible, and I'm earnestly not sure which one worries me more.\" Just to give an example, ending unnecessary military interventions and mass incarceration are two of the most important federal issues for me  Biden has a record vigorously supporting foreign engagements and supporting \"tough on crime\" laws that have led to mass incarceration. Trump is one of the only presidents to not start any new military engagements in the last 40 years. He will attack Biden's record of cheerleading for wars, for decades, from the left, accurately.   I'm honestly not sure Biden would be better than Trump as far as avoiding new military engagements were concerned, and that's deeply depressing in a democratic candidate.   > there is no difference between them   Have never seen this in the wild.  > you should just sit out the general election    Nearly all the posting I've seen related to this were people expressing the own desire to just say fuck it and stay home, I've not yet seen endorsing that others do the same. Nearly every post I've seen like this has been met with a flood of response telling that person that they should at least show up to vote third party or Vermin Supreme, and that down-ballot elections are far more important to participate in than federal elections.  > I've also seen people who are ostensibly on the left, or trying to say they're on the left, making accusations against Biden and then for support linking to a flimsy Youtube video on a channel that had a lot of Jordan Peterson, Alex Jones, and \"let's laugh at these crazy SJW\"-type videos.   The closest to this that I've seen are somewhat honest worrying about Biden's brain slowly melting live on national press. I think its a genuine concern and the main reason that he'll have little chance against Trump in the general. It often comes across poorly because its mostly poking fun at a declining old man.  >It wouldn't be hard for a Republican operative or pro-Trump foreign actor to start posting this stuff, or just coordinating upvotes when it does happen.

Some argue that the moderator should be more avidly fact-checking the debates, while others argue that such a proposition would be overrun with bias.  However, there were a few moments where candidates made statements that are objectively incorrect. It's true, matters of hypothetical policy cannot be objectively measured. However, matters of public record can be. Here is Donald Trump incorrectly claiming that he has not called global warming a Chinese hoax. Here's a long list of tweets (plus one video!) where he does very clearly call global warming a hoax. And for the sake of fairness, Hillary Clinton absolutely did call the TPP the \"gold standard,\" no \"hope it would be\" anywhere to be found.  Most of these are big talking points, and a candidate has to know that these topics would be brought up. Both Trump saying Clinton called TPP the \"gold standard\" and Clinton saying Trump called global warming a \"Chinese hoax\" are *objectively true statements.* They are on the record. And there needs to be a protocol for that objective evidence to be presented to the public. In both events, the candidate against which the claims were made interrupted with a form of protest. Trump claimed he never said that, while Clinton tried to twist the context into a \"hope it will\" situation, even though that is not how it was delivered. Particularly in a debate like this one, that means no minds will be changed. There is no debate of facts, it's simply he said, she said. Trump supporters will believe Trump is unfairly being attacked, even when it is undeniable fact that he said those things about climate change. Clinton supporters will argue her words were taken out of context, when in-context they don't sound much better.   I don't propose the moderator himself take the role of fact-checker, but both camps should be able to present an indisputable piece of evidence to support them. Instead, they should simply admit or reject evidence presented by the campaigns.  It's not a perfect solution, and it will change the format of the debates to some extent. However, there are cases where there is objectively correct, and objectively incorrect. Many situations in the debate do not fall into those two categories. However, it's mind-boggling to think that one candidate can say \"I never said that,\" the other can say \"yes you did,\" and the moderator can say \"let's agree to disagree\" and move on to another question. When there is an objective truth, there should be a non-partisan system in place to make it clear to the audience who is in the right, and who is in the wrong. _____  > *Hello, users of CMV!

It's deeply saddening to think that there's someone in the world who's hated by so many people and has little to nothing left to lose if she loses this case. I feel bad, because if she loses, I could see her ending her own life, and a lot of people would revel in joy over it. Which to me, is a testament to how far humanity has fallen down a sad path.  Even if she doesn't lose, that's an unbearable weight of shame and humility to carry around. I truly worry that we're watching the beginning to the end of her life. No one deserves this much spite from so many people.  If she were a serial killer, mass murderer, I would be able to sympathize more with it, but at this point I can't. The relationship had mutual abuse, maybe not equal abuse, but it was mutual.\n\nAssistant:"

But I highly disagree with that for the following reasons:  1. The general audience has a negative preconception about DC, and that stigma is not going away anytime soon, at least not in this decade. So while a reboot might be exciting news for someone who is already a DCEU fan, the casual audience is still not going to care. And if the general audience is lukewarm about your IP at best, then it shouldn't be a surprise when the upcoming movies disappoint in the box office.  2. A reboot doesn't guarantee better quality. How are you so confident that the next cinematic universe won't also have its fair share of duds? How would the quality of a newly introduced franchise with no previous baggage like Black Adam have changed? If you're simply rebooting your cinematic universe because your movies suck, then are you gonna reboot the next one as soon as you get a few mixed reviews on Rotten Tomatoes?  3. If you're not rebooting because of the quality of the previous movies, but because of a messy established continuity, then how are you going to start the new continuity? Are you really going to start from square 1 with Superman's and Batman's origins being told all over again? Don't you see how unbelievably stale that is? Especially when so many people are complaining about \"superhero fatigue\"?  Keep in mind, I'm talking about a hard reboot. I have no problem with DC doing a soft reboot where they keep everything that worked and toss out everything that didn't.\n\nAssistant:"

Now, undoubtedly, the United States is not the #1 country on a number of metrics, but it is still a very good place to live, and easily in, say, the top 25 of countries in the world, which means it is actually a very very good place to live.  **What Problems Do People Talk About**  First, I think it is important to take a step back, and look at the issues that are often talked about in the United States. I hear a lot of complaints about health care, about the stagnation of wages, the shrinking of the middle class, unequal policing, structural racism, etc.  What do all of these have in common?  None of them are signs of basic failure of a state. We talk about \"food insecurity\", not hunger. We talk about \"lack of health insurance\", not a lack of hospitals, doctors or medicine. We talk about \"aging and insufficient infrastructure\" and not a lack of infrastructure altogether. We talk about \"structural racism\" and \"racist police policies\" not usually about individual, interpersonal racism.  America has the problems of a developed nation that has done a lot of things right, not the problems of a failed state that has been unable to provide for the basic needs of most of its citizens.  Now lets talk about a few:  **Healthcare**  In 2020, 91.4% of people had health insurance. According to Wikipedia, of the 27.2 million uninsured under age 65:  * 4.5 million had an employer's insurance offer (making them ineligible for ACA/Obamacare coverage) but declined it; * 6.4 million were eligible for Medicaid or other public healthcare program but did not pursue it * 5.3 million were eligible for ACA/Obamacare tax credits but did not enroll in the program. * Nearly 12 million (43%) of persons were eligible for financial assistance (Medicaid or ACA subsidies) but did not enroll to obtain it.  So almost half of the uninsured have programs that are designed to help them obtain insurance, but they do not pursue it. This is barely a failure of US policy, and more a failure of individuals taking advantage of the options available to them.  As for all the bankruptcies supposedly caused by medical debt. This paper examined that, and found that:  > we estimate that hospitalizations cause only 4% of personal bankruptcies among nonelderly U.S. adults, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the previous estimates described above of it causing 60% of all bankruptcies]  Now don't get me wrong, we should try to make those 4% of bankruptcies not happen, but healthcare is much less of a problem than it would be if it caused 60% of all bankruptcies.  It's also worth pointing out that [EMTALA is the law of the land. If you go to an emergency room with a serious problem in the United States, you will be treated for it, regardless of ability to pay. Therefore, we have universal emergency health care already.  We just lack universal preventative health care. That would certainly be a good thing to pursue in the long term, but it's worth pointing out that, whatever disadvantages having employer-provided health insurance as our core form of health insurance might have (less ability to quit, be self-employed, etc.) we actually have a very good system overall.  **Inequality, and the Shrinking Middle Class**  This post talks about the problem with the shrinking middle class narrative:  > Using the \u201c0.5-1.5 of median wage\u201d definition, the middle class has indeed decreased from 53% in 1967 to 51% in 1979 to 45% in 2012. > > In \u201967, the 24-87th percentiles earned middle class incomes. In \u201979 it was 24-85. In 2012 it was 24-79. The percent of households earning below half of the median wage has not changed one iota in half a century. The median wage itself could be dropping, which would be an actual problem, but the entire \u201cdecline\u201d in the middle class is entirely caused by middle class people achieving escape velocity and becoming rich. Imagine the horror!  So, far from the American dream being over, more people are richer than ever before, and the middle class has not been shrinking due to more people being poor, but due to more people being rich.  Now look at this chart of disposable income by country. Quoting again:  > Despite wildly varying social expenditures, income-wise the US looks remarkably like a Finland or a Norway except with a bunch of millionaires added on top of everyone else (it\u2019s true that this chart doesn\u2019t account for quality of public services). Is having a bunch of millionaires in your country a good or a bad thing? Whatever it is, it\u2019s the single issue everyone in the US seems obsessed with.  The other aspect is that a lot of statistics making arguments about the American poor fail to take welfare and other cash transfers into account. When you factor those in, you get the following:  > After accounting for all income, charity, and non-cash welfare benefits like subsidized housing and food stamps, the poorest 20 percent of Americans consume more goods and services than the national averages for all people in most affluent countries. This includes the majority of countries in the prestigious Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), including its European members. In other words, if the US \u201cpoor\u201d were a nation, it would be one of the world\u2019s richest.  People underestimate how rich the United States is. Look at this Wikipedia page comparing the GDP per capita of US states vs. sovereign states. Even a poor state like Mississippi is almost as rich as the *countries* of France and the United Kingdom, and richer than Spain, Italy, Slovakia, Hungary and Russia.  And if you take PPP into account) things look even more favorable.  The United States is not a bad place to live by global standards, or even by Western European standards.\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " Compared to the poorest places on the planet? sure.  Compared to the top 10 economic powers in the world? For the average person - not really.  While the USA GDP per capita is $65k, while the other 9 of the top 10 economic powers average only $29.96 between them -- in NONE of those other 9 do bankruptcies due to medical bills happen, because in all of them there exists universal health care as a human right.  All of the others have REQUIRED maternity and paternity leave for parents. Now, you may think that doesn't matter much, but it does. Study after study shows that paternity leave increases wage parity, increases paternal bonding with children, increases a husband's participation in household chores -- and those changes last a lifetime! Further, increased paternal bonding decreases divorce rates and decrease child delinquency rates.  All of the others besides China have minimum wage laws that create livable wages. They have guaranteed paid vacations. The quality of life is better. Because insurance isn't tied to having a job, people can afford to leave a job they don't like to find a better one without fear of not having their medical bills paid.  Moreover, because the welfare systems are just functionally more robust, almost every developed nation (except Canada) has more entrepreneurs than the USA (and quite a few places that aren't that developed - like Brazil and Mexico):  https://cdn.theatlantic.com/media/mt/business/assets\\_c/2012/10/OECD\\_Enterprise\\_Birthrate-thumb-615x289-100458.png  US entrepreneurship and small businesses have been on a steady decline for decades -- and that's in no small part because our welfare and health care and social programs don't support risk-taking: https://www.inc.com/magazine/201505/leigh-buchanan/the-vanishing-startups-in-decline.html  And that is a HUGE problem because, as that article points out, small businesses is where innovation happens. Europe and Asia aren't going to beat us because they are wealthy than we are. They are going to beat us because they will easily out-innovate us because they have many, many, many more small businesses per capita than we do, and are thus able to and willing to take more risks and be more innovative than we will.  And that is all because our welfare state sucks rocks compared to the rest of the developed world.  Yes, we're not a bad place to be compared to, say, Ethiopia. But we are a bad place to be compared to Italy, and France, and Brittain, and many other developed nations. And as a result, we are going to lose the innovation war, and thus will lose the economic battle for the 21st century and beyond. And that will be the end of American economic supremacy. Not population growth, not military might, not anything more than a simple failure to give a damn about ourselves enough to pay for a social safety net that works well enough to allow for real entrepreneurs to flourish.     Our poor economic policies around social programs -- thinking in terms of welfare instead of human rights and collective good -- is going to be our economic death. And that is, I think, a reason to consider it a bad place to be compared to countries where that won't happen."

Same with complaining about them getting goverment assitance. As someone with many health conditions, it is pretty impossible for me to work. I have severe asthma, vision issues, vision blacks out sometimes, major allergies, one kidney, kidney stones, seizures (sleep ones, not often), cervicalgia (neck issues), vertigo, anxiety, a TBI (traumatic brain injury)...etc.   But the worst thing is I have migraines on average of 22 times a month. To the point of throwing up and (trigger warning) often wanting to just shoot myself from the pain. It's a nightmare. And after a migraine (with or without med help) you spend a day basically sleeping because your body has been so worn out.   So when people tell me I'm either lazy or bring up \"Well I know who is a quadriplegic with cancer that works!\", it's annoys me to no end. Now obviously I am not saying other people's health/disabilities are easy to live with of course. And there are of course people who have it even worse than me.   But most people with things like cancer, missing limbs...etc. They still have a normally wired brain. So working is not an issue (again, not that they always can work). Migraines are pure agony, sometimes for the whole day. Pain beyond imagination. One woman told me she would rather have the pain of giving birth than her migraines.   Her husband works from home because sometimes she can't even take care of her kids because of the migraine. You can spend your whole day in your bedroom with room darkening shades/curtains with no noise and an eye mask on and in some cases many ice packs on your head.   I've tried many jobs for a long time. Anytime I go from one temperature to another and there's a big difference (like from 80f to 65f), it triggers a migraine. Cold and heat trigger my migraines in general. If there is to much noise, I get a migraine, if I get to much anxiety, it triggers a migraine, if I am around bright lights, I get a migraine...etc.   And with other health issues like anxiety in big crowds, being the center of attention, being talked to even at times, that causes other issues. To much activity kicks in my asthma. Most lights give my vision issues where it shakes and someti9mes my vision blacks out and I see nothing. Sometimes this leads to seizures.   As it is I already have had TBI which made me loss alot of my schooling and memories. So now I have learning issues, memory issues...etc. My IQ went from 151 to 109 (not that IQ is everything of course).  One thing people often bring up is working from home. And first issue I have is often places that let you work from home have crazy qualifications like having to have years of working at home experience beforehand. Which is ironic given how can you work at home if you are required to have worked at home before? Or some require degrees.   Next issue is missing your work. Even if your at home, I'm sure any boss would not be thrilled that in a week's time I only got an hour of work done because I was spending most of my days with migraines or recovering from them. Thankfully I'm happy to see many people with migraines have the same issue with people not understanding how hard it is to work.  Being trapped on Medicaid and getting government health is hell itself. People tend to say \"You leech of the system and get free money!\" You barely get enough to even pay your rent. Food stamps only give you enough money to buy unhealthy foods. If I want to by fruits and veggies and some health drinks... I'll have enough of that for MAYBE two weeks if lucky because that stuff is expensive. Instead, you buy things like soda, ramen noodles, man n cheese, garbage cereal...etc. Which makes you obese, which leads to more health issues.   And the harassment from people finding out you on any of this stuff is another hell. You get even more anxiety from the dreading question of \"What do you do for a living?\" because you know what that entails after the answer.   And lets not forget the side effects of my 15 meds. Including tiredness, weight gain, ruining your other organs. My first seizure med I was only 165 pounds. Within 3 months it got me up to 210 pounds. My doc switched me to something else. Since then (about almost two decades ago) I am now up to 272 pounds.   Now comes \"Why not exercise then?\" Well that leads to the temperature difference which triggers migraines. ANd trust me I've tried everything when working out. Even have a treadmill so so the temp stays the same inside. But my body temp changes and I get a migraine. I even tried massive fans being on, ice packs on my head or around my spine. Doesn't make a difference.   The one and ONLY saving grace and reason I have not \"ended things\" is my wonderful wife I met 8 years ago. She came from another country and is a caring, loving and hard-working woman whom I worship. She has to deal with a husband in this situation and yet work her butt off for us. She doesn't make alot, but we survive none the less. We can't have kids because we cannot afford to, but we know its just how it is despite it hurting knowing we can't have kids yet.   So now that I wrote a book basically. CMV about making comments to disabled people just because \"I know someone\" or \"I hate leeches\"....etc.\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " TL;DR Disabled person not right in the head tries to make a point.   Let's talk about traumatic brain injuries.   My mother got a TBI six years before I was born that shorted out one hemisphere of her brain. When I went through puberty the combination of neurological damage and memory issues caused her to not recognize I was her child. She cannot string together a coherent sentence of more than 5 words, more than that turns into a jumble that makes no sense at all.    She has been on disability since she came out of the coma. She also started working volunteer jobs when I was in grade school. Never more than an hour or two per job but she had between 7 and 14 jobs depending on the time of year. So I am not judging you for being on disability. I do think you are lazy and full of excuses and that there is work you could do.   Most of my personal heroes are disabled people that achieved greatness in spite of (and in a few cases because of) their disabilities. People like Frida Kahlo who spent most of her life in pain in bed and still managed to be one of the most famous artists of the 20th century. People like John Nash who has paranoid schizophrenia and was bestowed the Nobel Prize for Economics. Last but not least, Stephen Hawking who needs no explanation.   I am also disabled. I have a SMI, heart defect, migraines and cluster headaches, my vision blacks out at random moments, and I was recently diagnosed with diabetes on top of it all. So I do not have a normally wired brain and working for me is a huge issue, but because it is a smaller issue for me when compared to mom, I have always worked and often through excruciating pain.  Now, let's talk about some of your excuses, because that is what they are by the examples I was given in life. YMMV but I can't post a response to you if I agree with you.   That old saw about unhealthy food being cheaper than healthy food is bullshit. There are many stores that feature fresh produce along with farmer's markets and ranch markets. You can also get healthy grains pretty cheap. I spend more on the packaged foods than I do on the fresher foods. The real difference is the amount of effort you put into cooking. Even if you can buy ramen cheaper, hit a food bank for some canned veggies to add to them.   Your statement about work from home jobs might have been true pre COVID, but during COVID many centers that previously did not offer WFH adopted the model to keep employees working. Granted, most of them are call centers that added a chat department, but reading people's complaints on a screen is a lot easier than having to listen to them. Check into the Ticket to Work program through your disability office or even VOC Rehab which can get you a position based on your abilities and accommodations for your disabilities included limited work hours without you losing your benefits.   Speaking of losing your benefits, if you are on SSI (US disability) then you can begin to work and continue to receive SSI benefits as long as your wages and other resources do not exceed the SSA\u2019s income limit for SSI; however, your monthly benefit amount will be reduced in proportion to your income. It is a pretty liberal reduction. So if you engage in a VOC rehab program you can earn extra money because you only lose 50 cents of benefit payments for every dollar you get paid. Not sure how other countries handle these things.   Now let's move on to exercise. You do not have to do major exercise, do what you can. Start by making one extra trip around your home each day. Do it in stages so you don't overheat. Get a light weight, like a 5 pound bag of flour or a can from the pantry. Start simple and lift the weight one or two times with each arm every half hour. It's not a lot, but you can increase the amount you are doing as works for you. You will not burn a lot of weight or get buff, but at the stage you are at, anything helps.   Money isn't the only reason you cannot have kids, you have no one to care for them. She works and you overheat if you move too much. Who is going to take care of the baby? That is 8 pounds or more of live wriggling weight that needs a lot of care and is only going to increase in size and activity requirements on your part. You can have kids and be disabled, but you have to develop coping techniques.   Last but not least, as a long term migraine sufferer one of the tools I use is a drop of an over the counter topical analgesic rubbed into the temples. It does not take all the pain away, but it dulls it down to a workable level. It has allowed me to be able to increase the amount of time I could work."

Big Governments invariably tend to abuse their power. However, the main reason why big governments get abusive is because of the disproportional accumulation of power. And humans absolutely suck at retaining their values and ethics when they get extraordinary levels of power. As such, I find big governments no different at all from megarich individuals or mega corporations. In modern times, they are the ones who actually run the government. They use lobbying and funding to control and push their agendas, to pass highly unethical laws that consolidate and promote their own self interests. They own the politicians.  I only have a basic level understanding of libertarianism but my interpretation of the core philosophy is about \"live and let live\". Give people full autonomy but equally importantly, they should not infringe on your autonomy. Your hand stops at my nose, figuratively speaking.  The big problem is, when megarich individuals as well as megacorporations are left unsupervised, they wield such extraordinary levels of power, that they are literally above the system, above any level of accountability. I feel that libertarians should be as concerned about them as they are about Big Government.  I totally realize and acknowledge the dilemma I am presenting here.

You can find it  https://www.yang2020.com/policies/gun-safety/ or below:  As President, I will\u2026  * Promote a stringent, tiered licensing system for gun ownership (think a CDL vs. a regular driver\u2019s license): * All tiers * Pass a federal background check, eliminating the gun show loophole. * Tier 1 \u2013 Basic hunting rifles and handguns * Pass a background check * Pass a basic hunting/firearm safety class * Provide a receipt for an appropriately-sized gun locker, or trigger lock per registered gun. * Tier 2 \u2013 Semi-automatic rifles * Have a Tier 1 license for at least 1 year * Be at least 21 years of age * Pass an advanced firearm safety class. * Tier 3 \u2013 Advanced and automatic weaponry * Maintain current restrictions and definitions (National Firearms Act of 1934) * Ban high-capacity magazines * Require submission of fingerprints and DNA to the FBI * Submit to a gun locker inspection to ensure it can house the weapons * Undergo yearly refresher trainings on the use of these firearms. * Anyone with a history of violence, domestic abuse, or violent mental illness would be restricted from receiving a license. * Those who currently own any firearms will: * Be grandfathered in with their current license, and for the 1-year requirement if they decide to apply for a Tier 2 license * Receive a one-time \u201cGood Gun Owner\u201d tax credit for adhering to the additional requirements implemented by the new system * Be allowed a tax write-off for the purchase of any equipment required to adhere to the new standards * Be allowed to register any currently unregistered firearm without facing any penalties. * Individual states will determine their concealed carry/open carry laws, and reciprocity will not be federally enforced. However, a concealed or open carry license in one state would satisfy all licensure requirements in all states. * Prohibit the manufacture and sale of bump stocks, suppressors, incendiary/exploding ammunition, and (yes, this is currently legal) grenade launcher attachments. * Create federal safety guidelines for gun manufacture and distribution, similar to federal car safety requirements, with strict penalties for the violation of these guidelines. * Encourage gun manufacturers to implement designs that prevent interchanging parts that alter the functionality of the firearm. * Implement a federal buyback program for anyone who wants to voluntarily give up their firearm. * Invest in innovative technology that would make firearms harder to fire for non-owners of the gun, and create a federal, bipartisan panel to determine when technological innovations are advanced and reliable enough to be included in manufacturing safety requirements. * As stated here, invest in a more robust mental health infrastructure. This will help to identify and treat people with mental health illnesses that make them prone to violence. * Increase funding to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, and drastically increase funding to the US Department of Veterans Affairs Suicide Prevention efforts. * Initiate and fund mindfulness programs in schools and correctional facilities, which have been demonstrated to reduce violent behavior. * Invest heavily in law enforcement training to de-escalate situations involving firearms.  &#x200B;  Joe Biden https://joebiden.com  Kamala Harris  https://kamalaharris.org/issue/action-on-gun-violence/   Elizabeth Warren https://elizabethwarren.com/issues   Pete Buttigieg https://peteforamerica.com/issues/#GunLaws  Bernie Sanders  https://berniesanders.com/issues/gun-safety/   Beto Orourke  https://betoorourke.com/issues/   &#x200B;  How I define best: totally subjective. have at it.

                "content": " Alriight. lets go through this point by point: Pass a federal background check and eliminate the gun show loophole. The gun show loophole is a pretty blatant example of liberal fear mongering on guns. In 2016 only .8 percent of felons obtained their firearm from a gun show. (source table 5 page 7) https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/suficspi16.pdf  There are a lot of misconsceptions about what goes on at a gun show. If you are a dealer you are required to conduct a background check whether you are at a gun show ore not. So what this loophole is about is private transfers. It should be noted that back when we got background checks the compromise that the NRA negotiated was that they wouldn't object to mandatory background checks from retailers if gun control advocates would leave private transfers alone. No sooner was the deal signed into law than democrats started screaming about the gun show loophole. What closing the gun show loophole  really means is closing the private transfer loophole. A private transfer does not even have to necessitate the exchange of money. If I borrow a friend's shotgun to go out to the rifle range and he isn't going to be there, that is a transfer. If I lone a friend my hunting rifle for the week that is a transfer. What closing the gun show loophole would do is inject additional paperwork into that process.  Pass a basic hunting/ firearm safety class I am actually ok with this on one condition; this firearm safety class needs to be available through the public school system at the very least to highschoolers. The right to keep and bear arms is exactly that: a right. Therefore if the government sees it necessary to put an additional barrier between an individual and that right they have an obligation to make sure that access to that right is still achievable by individuals of all social and economic statuses.   That being said. This is also unecessary. upwards of a third of Americans report that they own guns. Furthermore whether they own them or not close to 70% of Americans have shot a gun (source)https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/the-demographics-of-gun-ownership/. With that being said, in 2017 we had only 582 fatal accidental firearm injuries (source) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4700838/  Provide a receipt for a gun safe or trigger lock.   So many problems with this. First of all, provide a receipt to who? Second of all how is that going to work with the massive number of people who are going to need to be grandfathered in? I do not still have the receipt for my gun safe. And furthermore, at what point do I legally need to get a new gun safe? Because I'm a cheap bastard. I am going to put as many guns in my safe as I can before I buy another one.   Thirdly, clarify for me what exactly this is supposed to accomplish. Gun ownership is a constitutionally guaranteed right. To accept a restriction on it I need to see a clear purpose behind that restriction. Walk me through the cause and effect of how this is justified logically.   Tier two semi auto rifles.  Have a tier one license for at least one year  from my perspective a gun is a gun. I own a lever action rifle that holds 10 rounds with this nifty little thing on the side of it called a loading gate. What it does is allow me to load the rifle continuously while keeping it shouldered. I cannot keep up with a semi automatic rifle per rate of fire but i am not going to feel that much better if someone breaks into my home with a lever gun as opposed to a semi automatic rifle. If you can get a tier one rifle the bottom line is you are getting license to own a weapon that is not in any way unsuited to violence against your fellow man.   Be 21 years of age  The most common 22 caliber rifle on the market is the ruger 10 22. It is a semi automatic rifle that comes with a detachable 10 round magazine but that can also be fitted with 25 round magazines. It is ubiquitous and many kid's first small game hunting rifle. are we going to treat it like an assault rifle now?   Pass an advanced gun safety class.   What does this even mean? the rules for safe firearms handling do not substantially change whether or not you are shooting a musket or a machine gun. You treat every gun like it is loaded, you always keep it pointed in a safe direction, your finger stays off the trigger until you are ready to fire and you make sure you are ok with destroying whatever is behind it. What are you going to teach in an  advanced firearm safety course? What is so fundamentally different about a semi automatic firearm that it requires its own safety course. Give me one concrete answer.   I am assuming everything past maintaining current restrictions in tier three applies to all firearms.   Ban high capacity magazines. I am going to assume you mean any magazine over 10 rounds because that is the definition I see in the public discourse. This solves very little the parkland school shooter only used 10 round magazines. This video does a good demonstration of why this will not make a substantial impact.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCSySuemiHU Secondly this would be hugely impact on the vast majority of gun owners. the vast majority of handguns on the market have a magazine size greater than 10.   Require submission of fingerprints and DNA to the FBI. So I know that the patriot act already substantially undermined our right to be free from unreasonable searches but that doesn't mean we are right to go further down that road. Owning a gun is not a substantial predictor of predilection to criminality. Why should I have to give my fingerprint and DNA to the FBI.  Submit to a gun locker inspection. Same as before. this is an unreasonable search. What makes a house capable or incapable of housing firearms especially considering that under this plan I already have to prove that I own a gun safe.   Undergo a yearly refresher training.  If I am shooting regularly, that is my yearly refresher. Contrary to popular belief we gun owners are not accidentally shooting ourselves in substantial number. What problem does this solve?   Anyone with a history of violence.   If you are guilty of a misdemeanor domestic violence charge it is already illegal for you to own a firearm and this will show up on a background check. Source https://www.justice.gov/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1117-restrictions-possession-firearms-individuals-convicted I am not opposed to expanding that but this is not a new provision we have had it since the beginning.   Im skipping over a few of them but what does this mean?   \"Individual states will determine their concealed carry/open carry laws, and reciprocity will not be federally enforced. However, a concealed or open carry license in one state would satisfy all licensure requirements in all states.\"  This statement contradicts itself. It says that the states get to determine whether or not they have reciprocity but at the same time if you have a license in one state you automatically qualify for one in another state. This turns states like California, Hawaii and New York into \"shall issue\" states; which frankly I am all for but I'm not quite sure that is what Mr Yang meant. Please clarify.   Prohibit the manufacture of bump stocks, suppressors, incendiary or exploding ammunition. So all of these are a little different. I take no issue with banning bump stocks but the suppressor ban is a problem. Suppressors are coming into widespread use. You have to get a tax stamp and wait 6 months for one. What evidence is there that these are being used inappropriately? silencers are an absolute rarity in violent crime. (source) http://www.westerncriminology.org/documents/WCR/v08n2/clark.pdf  Create federal safety guidelines. To do what?  This is vague what are we describing here?   Encourage gun manufacturers to implement designs that prevent interchanging parts that alter the functionality of the firearm.  Again what does this mean? does it mean I can's switch out the barrel on my AR-15 for a shorter one? This is vague and furthermore what is it supposed to accomplish?   Most of the rest of that list I don't take issue with but I see a pretty clear pattern of buzzwords, fearmongering and a lack of critical though about what the actual effect of this legislation will be."

But things like light and meals will cause the melatonin levels to go down in order to tune the circadian rhythm to an even 24 hours which matches the day and night cycle.  In addition to the circadian rhythm the entire brain does not fall asleep. Part of your brain never sleeps and is able to wake up other parts on demand. This is how we have been able to stay alive for millions of years without getting eaten by predators or taken by landslides even though we need sleep every night. So even when sleeping you are constantly listening out for cues that it is time to get up and might even open your eyelids to scan the environment before falling back asleep. This means that things like a clock in the room, the sound of garbage men outside, light through the window, the neighbors alarm clock, etc. can cue your brain onto the idea that it is now time to wake up."

Doesn't the pylon and nacelle add weight and drag? Why wouldn't they be built into the aircraft as much as possible to reduce the aircraft's frontal area and mass?  Meanwhile, turboprop & piston engines are almost always integrated into the wings or fuselage (examples here). Intuitively, this seems way more optimal. Why can't this be done with turbojets?

You don't have to radically redesign your wing or entire aircraft just to change out the engine.  This last one is probably the biggest.  Through the years aircraft engines have gotten bigger, and the ability to upgrade the engine and source slightly different engines from multiple vendors greatly extends the lifespan of the plane.  The original A320 could come with a CFM engine with a 68.3\" fan or an IAE engine with a 65.3\" fan.  More recently they started offering A320s with new engine options(A320neo) which have a 78\" or 81\" fan.  But because these engines are all mounted on a pylon, the wing and core of the airframe has remained the same through all of this which greatly reduced development and manufacturing costs  Engineers like leaving options open because it potentially saves you a lot of time, money, and effort in the future"

The 3 body problem is a \"chaotic\" system, which means that approximations won't get you close to the right answer.  For example, suppose I threw some dice up in the air. With high school physics, you could tell me where the dice will be in 10 seconds. You don't need to know the air pressure of the room, or coefficient of friction of my hands, etc. You can neglect relativistic effects from travelling 0.0000001%  of the speed of light. You could even approximate the initial mass and velocity by 10%, and your final guess would be more-or-less within 10% of the correct answer.  Compare this to a \"chaotic\" problem where you try to guess which number will show on the dice. **There's no way to say \"I made these approximations so I think I'll be within 10% of the right answer.\"** You'd need to account for every single force interacting on the dice to be confident that your prediction was correct.  In the case of the 3 body problem, you can make approximations to guess what will happen in a short period of time, but the farther ahead you try to predict, less meaningful the answer will be.  EDIT: not sure what proper etiquette here is, but thanks for the awards!"

Some of you posted some good sources indicating how easily adrenaline is spread throughout the body thanks to the blood volume / vascularity of the kidneys, on top of which the adrenal glands sit. This is accurate, but I think OP is talking about the sudden \"oh shit\" feeling we get, and adrenaline takes a few good heart pumps to get coursing through your veins and start affecting the various systems it needs to affect.  That sudden electric feeling is probably a LOT of neurons firing. Your brain just noticed some bad shit is about to happen, so it's activating as much as it can to prepare for what's next. Your pupils dilate, your hairs stand on end. Your heart rate increases.  Adrenaline is slower-working. It will trigger things like breakdown of stored carbohydrates to help you do work over time.  Edit: The main argument against my explanation was that adrenaline (epinephrine / norepinephrine) is used as a neurotransmitter (released by neurons rather than by adrenal glands, in which case they would be considered hormones). Fair enough. I honestly wish I'd taken a second to think of which neurotransmitter was affecting these responses. Hope I didn't confuse anyone."

Those 32 pieces are of 6 types, and each type has rigid limits on how it can move. The starting position of every piece and every type is pre-determined and always the same, so there is very little variation in opening moves (to the point where even humans can memorize all of the possible board variations after the first two moves, because there's only a few hundred). And the entire board is visible at once, so every player knows the position of ever game piece. Also, chess is a game of reduction: over the course of the game, pieces are removed from the board, which _reduces_ the total number of possible moves as the game progresses. There are never more than the starting 32 pieces.  A lot of what chess AI's have traditionally done is brute force computation of all the possible moves several moves ahead and ranking of those outcomes. They can do that _because_ chess is more predictable than other games.   Now, compare this to something like Civilization. There are thousands of hexes on a Civilization map. There are as few as two and as many as a dozen (?? maybe it's less, I don't recall) players, human and AI. There is no real maximum number of game pieces (although there's probably a computational limit determined by the computer's processing power). There are dozens, if not hundreds, of different types of game pieces, each of which might have a different combination of moves and attack power. The starting positions of every piece is not predetermined, so you never know where on the game map an opponent will start or will add new pieces to the game. And most of the game field is unknown for most of the game. And new pieces _can_ be added: the game is additive, with new pieces being added all the time (even as a players overall force is being reduced), meaning that the number of possible moves increases much more rapidly than in a game like chess, particularly in mid-game.   tl;dr Chess is simple, so AI's can learn it. Civilization is way more complex, so AI's have to cheat to be smarter than humans."

How much depends on what kind of fabric it is. Some are much more stretchy, and some are less. These springs can go back to being curly, but that also depends on what kind of fabric it is. This also takes some energy to do, because they aren't quite like springs.   When you wash your clothes in hot water or put it in the dryer, the heat is actually a form of energy. This energy, in the right amount, is enough to make those stretched out phone cord fibers curl back up again. Sometimes we use too much energy though and they curl up way too much.   As I mentioned earlier, different types of fabric stretch different amounts, but they also can take different amounts of energy to get back to their original size.

Your nose's main job is to warm up and humidify the air as if enters your body, to prevent your lungs from getting too cold or drying out. The main way it does that is by increasing the blood flow to capillaries, which allows for heat to be transferred from your bloodstream to the air entering your body. That also causes water to filter out though, which makes for a runny nose. As your nose gets runny, the snot triggers the sensitive hairs in your nose, which cause a sneeze thinking that something is entering your body.    As for other symptoms, it has to do with how your body senses temperature. You have a sensor in your brain that tells it if you're too cold or too hot. If you're too cold, your brain amps up your metabolism, and forces your muscles to contract rapidly to turn glucose into heat. That's called shivering. When you have an infection, your immune system highjacks the sensor, turning up the thermostat, in an attempt to kill the germs, which makes your brain think you're too cold, and triggers the same shivering."

So, to fight a possible communist revolution, the Enabling Act was passed.  The Enabling Act was the German version of the War Measures act; it allowed Hitler to pass laws without consulting the rest of the government and also circumvent the constitution.    After the Enabling Laws were passed, Hitler started to wipe out the other political parties.  He started to pass laws that made his dictatorship legal.  Many of his political opponents were arrested, which gave the NSDAP (Nazis) the majority in the government and subsequent elections.  Hitler's paramilitary group, the SA, continued to harass all of his opponents.  Hitler eventually banned all political parties in July of 1933.  In 1934, Hitler executed his remaining enemies in the Night of the Long Knives.  Finally, President Hindenburg died in 1934, and Hitler combined the positions of President and Chancellor to make himself the Fuhrer.

And in order to not get less blood sent to your organs, your heart will beat faster.  And the faster the blood will get pumped, and because of the high blood pressure, the more blood will get to your right ventricule.

The problem is that it can be very difficult to actually figure out convincingly what the causal impact was of the minumum wage policy. It is not impossible but it is difficult, and so the evidence is not always clearly on one side. When we introduce a minimum wage our main concern is what the impact will be on unemployment. Economic theory says that the effect on unemployment is ambiguous, that is, a minimum wage can raise or lower unemployment depending on the level of the minimum wage and the circumstances.  Now, unemployment in a given area changes lots all the time, so even if it goes up after a minimum wage is introduced it is not clear whether this is because of the policy or it would have gone up anyway. One very popular strategy to get around this is to compare how unemployment changed to that of a similar place. Suppose the two places had unemployment rising and falling in the same way beforehand, then if the minimum wage is introduced in one place and unemployment suddenly rises there but not in the other place then this is evidence the minimum wage caused the rise. There are still big problems with this though, unemployment does not tend to be so parrellel between regions so the evidence is never so clear. Also worrying is that a minimum wage introduced in say, one state will affect nearby states (maybe workers from those states go to the new one to take advantage of the higher wages for instance) this could alter the affect of the policy but would not occur for a federal minimum wage.  My preferred strategy is what is called 'structural estimation'. Economic theory tells us that the effect of the minimum wage depends on certain features of the labor market (which is the kind of metaphorical market place where firms hire workers for certain wages). We may be able to measure these thing by using lots of data about the labor market. In fact we can create quite complicated models, sometimes requiring computer simulation, that take into account people crossing borders etc. Whether this kind of very theory-heavy approach or the mostly 'atheoretic' approach above is better is a subject of heated debate.  Anyway, there is a huge literature trying to estimate the effects of different levels of minimum wage using various approaches and data from various times and places. As for why there is still debate, well as you can gather from the above, the difficulties involved mean that evidence is not entirely conclusive. However, in the 90s when the federal minimum wage was set under Clinton there was much attention to the economic literature which at the time seemed to clearly support the idea that a minimum wage at the Clinton level was good for employment. I might add that even if there were very clear evidence there may still be disagreement. Even if a higher minimum wage would substantially raise unemployment then you could support it anyway because the lower paid workers who stay employed get higher wages."

A more apt comparison is between the GT40 and a new Le Mans prototype.  Compared to a modern Le Mans prototype it was more advantageous for the GT40 to be as fast on the Mulsanne Straight as it possibly could. The course at Le Mans now has chicanes deliberately added to the straight, to force drivers to slow down. There's only so much space to reach top speed now, so carrying as much speed through corners and accelerating as quickly as possible is more advantageous.  Last year's Le Mans winner, the Toyota TS050, had a top speed of 217.5 mph, which isn't all that much more than the GT40. However, it reached that top speed in much shorter straights and can corner much quicker than the GT40 ever could. Dan Gurney set the fastest lap in '66, at 3:30. Last year's fastest lap was 3:17, with two chicanes in the Mulsanne Straight. Overall the TS050 is **much** faster."

We unconciously make up hypothetical scenarios all the time, in order to gauge cause and effect. Sometimes referred to as 'the call of the void'. Step near the edge of a cliff, and you'll probably imagine what would happen if you jumped or fell. That's your brain warning you about potential danger, and telling you back the truck up.  But sometimes, that process takes a dark turn. Suicidal ideation- imagining what would happen if you killed yourself- is also normal and healthy. It's the brain being curious about the broader scope of our place in life, or the physical outcome of certain lethal actions. All of that is fine, totally fine, we have a little clump of meat in our brains that allows us to distinguish between the things we are pretending (or hypothesizing about) what we might want to do, and what we actually intend on doing.  But every once in a while, the signals get crossed. We take one of these hypotheticals and it moves from curious consideration into serious business. It jumps the filter. For a moment, you become convinced that that ideation is something you might want to do. This isn't the same thing at all as struggling with suicidal tendencies, which are long processes of many interwoven thoughts all bunched up with rationalizations and a common theme, no, this one is essentially a glitch in an otherwise healthy filter.  Mostly, humans end up weighing their options and through intense consideration realize that this thought isn't really as serious as it first seemed to be. The thought itself begins to dissolve, and soon it's all but gone. We have thoughts all the time that lead nowhere, and usually this kind of aberrant thought is discarded like the others.  Unless it has old friends. Maybe you went through a suicidal patch in high school, like so many do. Or maybe as an early adult, or a new parent, or whatever. Because of that, you have a portion of memory and thinking that takes suicide very very seriously and contains a lot of connections to other realms of thought. Perhaps youve set those thoughts aside, perhaps you haven't. Let's say for this example, that you have. You've gotten through it, or over it, or bottled it up- you've coped.  So. Now it seems like you've got a touch of asthma, or a very bad cough, and your doctor has prescribed you Prednisone. It's a classic corticosteriod, and basically strengthens your body's fighting stance to work through this little weak spot youve developed. It does that, in part, by imitating your adrenal glands, as though they were pumping full blast.  You know what also pumps up your adrenal glands? Stress. A shiton of stress, like the kind of crap you used to feel back the day when you wanted to clock yourself out. The elevated, often erratic hormone levels mimic high stress points, especially in puberty, and even later at any point when your hormones were going up and down. Big relationships. Parenthood Life-affecting career choices. All of those big-time events where, when people get down, they get really, really down.  Collectively, your brain picks up this hormone trail, because it's job is to respond to hormones and create effective strategies for dealing with the outside situations producing them. This new hormone wash is very reminiscent of the batch being pumped out in the Dark Days, and so it revisits (reactivates) the sections of your brain that were the most active during those times.  Now that original, random ideation, has a home to go to instead of being left out in the cold to die. Not just a home, there are tons of thoughts, memories, feelings, that welcome that filter-jumping thought like an old friend, that connect with it. Welcome it. And your very efficient brain, always willing to use an old, familiar framework instead of creating a new one says, well, perhaps this thought isn't such a weirdo after all, it seems to be valid, and makes a very good point. Well alright then, THE DARK DAYS HAVE RETURNED, EMERGENCY STATIONS, PREPARE THE ESCAPE PODS!  And that is why, occasionally, when taking drugs that affect or simulate stress hormones, there is an increase in suicidal ideation and tendencies, even if that drug was designed to alleviate them. Changes in your body, even helpful ones, can affect your thinking in profound and often unpredictable ways. The brain is just doing its best, and a pharmaceutical curveball can really pack a wallop.  .  Edit: Sources."

You could just give it to them and trust they won't look. But what if they do? Or what if the bank gets robbed? So instead you lock the information in a box and save the key at home. Then you give the box to them. They can safely store the box but they don't know what's in the box. So when you need the information you tell them to send the box to you. Then you open it with your key, look at the information, put it back, lock the box again and send it back to the bank.  But how do you know the bank can't just open the box with brute force?  Well the box is made up of a very strong material, lets call it Cryptonite. This is so strong it is practically impossible to break it. Technically you could break it, but you would have to drill for BILLIONS of years until it actually breaks.  This how a GOOD online passwords manager works. So make sure you chose a well known service.  &#x200B;  Edit: As many have asked, how do you know this is how the service works?  When you use a online service that handles your passwords there will always be some level of trust involved. They can be lying or they can have vulnerabilities/bug in their software.  A online password manager delivers two services. One is designing the box, the other is storing the box. And when their methods is not completely public, i.e. Open source, you can never be 100% sure it is secure.  So as many have suggested in the comments, use two services to achieve the same result.To continue with the analogy:  Since the bank won't let you know exactly how the box works, you don't want to use their box. Luckily there are box-experts out there that have designed boxes that are completely unbreakable. Also they will tell you how YOU can build them all by yourself, completely for free. So take their instructions and build the box and save the key somewhere only you know where it is. Or if it's a combination lock, just remember the combination. The you can tell the bank to store the box and you can be 100% sure they can't open it.  To leave the analogy, use KeePass to encrypt your passwords, then save the encrypted file(s) on Dropbox or Google Drive. This is completely free.  &#x200B;  Quantum edit: One thing that most people get wrong about quantum computing and cryptography is that they can (in the future) break public-key encryption, not symmetric encryption. The example in my analogy uses symmetric encryption so it will be safe against a quantum-computer-attack. Maybe I have to make the key longer but it won't break the encryption.

Photons are the \"carrier particle\" of electromagnetism, one of the four fundamental forces in the universe (along with gravity, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force).  Think about it this way: we know that things with like charges repel each other, like two electrons.  But how do the electrons \"know\" there is another electron nearby?  That force has to be communicated somehow, the particles have to exchange information.  The way they do that is with the force carrier particles.  Photons are the force carrier particle of electromagnetism, so whenever two electrons interact, they exchange photons.  Carrier particles are a kind of particle called \"gauge bosons\" and obey certain rules that define them: specifically, they have no mass, have a quantum spin of 1, follow Bose-Einstein statistics, and do not follow the Pauli exclusion principle (**basically** meaning two of them can occupy the same space; unlike fermions, which make up normal matter, which cannot occupy the same space actually the same quantum state, which is more complicated and its own Explain like I'm five years old but that's not important right now]).  Also, light is both a particle and a wave.  That is not something that can be intuitively grasped and there are many ELI5s out there explaining it, but the short version is: just accept it, it doesn't make intuitive sense but it's true.  The photons we see as light come from electrons rising and falling in shells around their atomic nuclei.  Energy can cause an electron to move up into a higher shell, called an excited state.  When the electron moves back down to the lower shell (the lowest is the ground state) that energy has to go somewhere, and it's released as a photon.  The frequency of the photon depends on how high the electron was and how far it fell back down.  That photon will eventually be absorbed by another electron, which will energize that new electron so it moves into a higher state.  Our eyes detect photons with special molecules that change shape when the electrons in the molecule get energized by a photon, which activates the nerves in our retina.  Photons are not \"made\" of anything (that we know of).  They are a fundamental part of the universe.  But if you want to get even more specific, they are excitations - bundled up packets of energy - in the electromagnetic field.  The electromagnetic field is produced by any charged particle, and exists throughout the universe.  A photon is what happens when you put a bunch of energy into the field.  Imagine you have a smooth blanket and you \"add energy\" to the blanket by lifting it at a single point.  That's what a photon is: that part of the electromagnetic field that has a lot of energy in one place.  The electromagnet force isn't \"made\" of anything, it's a fundamental property of the universe, part of the fabric of spacetime out of which the universe is made.  The \"speed of light\" is misleading, because that speed is not defined by light: rather, light is the thing we noticed first, more or less, and named it after that.  It's really a constant of the universe, a number that, like the electromagnetic field, is built into the fabric of spacetime.  A better way to think of it is that it's the speed of causality.  Since photons carry information to and from charged particles, imagine if photon moved infinitely fast.  That means that every charged particle in the universe would interact with every other charged particle in the universe instantly, because they would all be sharing information instantaneously.  But because photons (and the other carrier particles) have a limited speed, time happens because two charged particles that are closer together will exchange photons before a more distant charged particle.  All particles with zero rest mass move at the speed of light (in a vacuum), in fact they can't go anything *other* than that speed (in a vacuum).  Photons travel forever until they interact with matter and are absorbed.  A photon in a vacuum will travel forever until it interacts with another charged particle.  Light *waves*, however, obey the [inverse-square law, which basically means the farther the wave travels the weaker it will be.  It may be too weak to be detected after long enough.  *Disclaimer: Not a physicist, please correct me on anything I got wrong.*"

                "content": " Autism is a form of neurodivergency, which means that if you have it, your brain works differently in some way. Other examples of neurodivergency include ADHD, Schizophrenia, DID, Tourettes, BPD, and sort of things like Depression or Anxiety, if they're permanent.  It's called a spectrum because what shows up and how can vary drastically; for example, a common trait of autism is sensory issues. One autistic person might have trouble telling sounds apart and need things at a higher volume to compensate. Another might be sensitive to noise and need volumes lowered to compensate. Sometimes both (yeowch).  Some examples of common traits include:  Sensory Issues  Social Issues  Stimming (This was the original purpose behind fidget spinners. For people with ADHD it can focus them. For people with autism it may serve as an outlet for extreme emotions, good or bad.)  Special Interests (The classic 'they only talk about dinosaurs, trains, etc.' The ADHD equivalent would be a hyperfocus. They're very similar. But, a special interest is more long term while a hyperfocus is short term, or recurrent. They can overlap. ADHD is frequently comorbid with autism, and vice versa.)  Meltdowns (They can be quiet or loud)  While sensory issues are a big part of autism, another is social issues. Again, when it's said it's a spectrum, it means it can be many different colours, or many colours. The stereotype is that autistic people are shy antisocial hermits who don't know how to talk to people. This is true, but you might meet an autistic person who is very outgoing and social. Maybe they still say the wrong things, maybe they can only handle so much before they need to leave the conversation, they're still autistic, it just looks, from an outside perspective, like two complete opposites.  One helpful way of looking at it, thought of by someone I do not remember, is that autism is a sandwich bar. You go up and you ask for cheese, tomatoes, and mayo on your sandwich. The person with you hates cheese, tomatoes, and mayo! They instead get lettuce, ham, and cucumber. The two sandwiches are very different, but, they're both still sandwiches. Autism is the same. Everyones is different, has different needs, and different impacts on their life.  This is why you may hear people say that 'high functioning' and 'low functioning' are bad terms to describe autism.   Let's say, you knew an autistic person who couldn't talk, and would only eat mashed potatoes and nothing else. And you also knew an autistic person who has a phd in quantum physics and could calculate complicated things inside their head when they were only 7.   Surely, you might say, the latter person is functioning higher than the former person. But what you don't see is that maybe the latter person has meltdowns if they talk too much in one day, and when they do, they feel the urge to bash their head into a wall and rock back and forth on the floor. As a kid, they used to, coming home from school. But no one saw it, and they've learnt to manage it, and know when to leave before it gets that bad. You don't see that the former person was neglected and abused, and, in another life, they could have learned to communicate via sign language or pictograms, and told everyone what was upsetting them, and what they needed to feel better. Someone could have communicated with them to find out why they only like certain foods, and how to expand their diet. They could have made friends similar to them, and develop coping mechanisms.  TLDR; Brains funky. Brain can funk in many ways but it's still funky. There are many forms of brain funk, some are similar, some are not. This brain funk tends to have these traits.  Hope this answers or explains things better. I am not a professional, but I am autistic.  Edit: Going to put some resources here for the people who may be questioning if they have autism! This was in another reply, but I think it is better to have it here. I highly recommend starting with the Aspie Quiz. Heck, even if you don't think you're autistic, it's a fun quiz and I believe the information gathered is helpful.  The community here on reddit is... a very mixed bag. The main autism subreddit skews quite nihilistic and woe is me. r/aspergirls is considerably more positive but, exclusively women and they also, last I checked, have a rule against 'implying you or someone else has autism without a diagnosis' which is silly.  There is a forum called Wrong Planet, which I rather liked last I browsed it. Skews positive, and has room for asking more practical questions about getting diagnosed and such.  Tumblr is actually very good for autism related posts, albeit it is... not very searchable. Lots of memes, peoples opinions, good causes to support, infographics.  The Aspie Quiz is not a diagnosis, but it can give you an idea. It will also suggest potential alternatives or comorbidities, and, often the questions will make you go 'wait, is that... not something everyone experiences?' For example, one question is 'you have a tendency to fixate on the hair of people you like or are close with'. I have no idea why that is a question but it sucker punched me. I never thought about it but I do. I used to get really annoyed when my crush cut his hair. Turns out that is not something everyone was thinking."

Gene pool drift is a continuous process, and we can only define species at all by where a gene pool differs from another gene pool in arbitrarily defined ways. Essentially, the idea of a species is just a colloquial thing we use to easily communicate a concept where it's obvious what we mean but impossible to entirely define it.   The stable parts of a genome, ie, the ones where all the different alternatives in the gene pool are very similar, tend to be the parts where mutation almost always causes a reproduction disadvantage. This mostly means the fundamental pieces that operate cells, like genes that code for ribosomes. Some genes that are really important to the species fitting its niche can also be \"protected\" like this. These genes are referred to as highly conserved, which essentially means that mutations to these genes almost always get removed from the pool before they can spread, and only stick around if the niche the species needs to occupy changes (and if that happens enough, the species becomes a new species).   There's not a great deal that's truly stable about a genome. Most of it can and will change over long enough time spans. However, each individual member of the species inherits normal genes from the gene pool with at most just a tiny handful of mutations. The low mutation rate means that the \"average\" gene pool remains pretty stable as a whole even though individuals may be changing quite a lot."

It's a beneficiary account from when my grandfather died. I called the bank where I was informed that I closed the account to pay for \"my wedding\". I told them I sure as hell did not and have been married for 6 years. After them jerking me around \"are you sure you're not getting married\" \"did you maybe forget about taking that money for your wedding\"...etc. I finally got them to open a fraud case.   Here's the crazy part. I call and basically stalk them to get them to investigate. I finally speak with someone and what happened is they gave my money away to another woman with the same name. This woman opened a car loan with the bank and because we have the same name they just hooked her name to my account. She lives in Florida and I live in colorado. We do not have anything else in common but our 1st and last name. So she ends up calling the bank they \"assure her\" that money is hers and a relative left it to her so she rushes down and withdraws it all. I figured all this out before the bank did through some good old fashioned Facebook and internet stalking sent them the info, boom. Open and shut case.  So now, the bank has admitted fault (finally) and will restore the account. They asked me not to file a police report, which sort of makes sense (they after all encouraged her to take it) but I have no idea what personal info of mine she has, and was given to her. The icing on the cake was I got a letter from the bank yesterday with her personal info on it, including address, so now they've compromised both our info.  Do I have any legal recourse? Do I just shut up and hope she doesnt steal my identity and be glad they're giving my money back? What advice do you have?\n\nAssistant:"

The rental market is a nightmare right now, so I'm trying to get advice on what we can do next (MA) As I said in the title, we fully planned on signing on for another year here and the landlord offered this about a week ago. About 3 days later, he told us he decided to sell the building and we could either use our deposit for June and be out by the end of the month, or pay June and use our deposit for July and be out by the end of July. I asked if we could stay and just rent from the new buyers, but he told me that he doesn't know who the buyers will be yet and he has work to do on the apartment before he lists it. All of this communication has been through text.  The rental market in the city we live in is insane right now, everyone is struggling. My partner and I are both on Unemployment at the moment, and I have a 13 year old son. Trying to apply for an apartment on Unemployment is going to be nearly impossible, and the time we've been given isn't going to be enough time to save up for a deposit and first and/or last month rent for a new place.  Needless to say, I'm terrified. We have been perfect tenants, have never paid rent a day late even once, keep everything clean and are quiet. I understand the market is great for sellers right now so I can't blame him, but I have a feeling this is going to drag on and be messy because we just logically aren't going to be able to find a place and be out in a month and a half. If I'd known sooner and had more time to look, it would have been different. I still don't know why he offered a new lease and then changed his mind days later, but I'm just hoping someone might be able to give some advice on what to do next.

I spent a lot of time making these videos a few years back, where I took public access TV and edited it to death, to make it crazy, awkward and surreal. I never put ads on it or anything, because I used other peoples material but according to my management, what I did falls under both \u201cfair use\u201d and \u201cremix\u201d, because the original content is distorted to such a degree, that it became something entirely new.  If you know Vic Berger, it\u2019s kinda like that, but even more far out and specifically targeted for a danish audience.  Anyway, the content never went super viral, but had a moderate cult following, which eventually led to me getting work with TV - so for me, it turned out to be super important, and helped me build my career.  Lately, my stuff has started to go viral on TikTok though, as lots of people are uploading various clips from my channel, and presenting it as their own stuff. I have no problem with this, as long as they credit me, and in most cases it\u2019s as simple as me asking them to do so, and everything is good. But now there is this one guy, who has become viral almost solely with content I made, and who refuses to credit me and instead insults me, and uses his following to make it look like I had nothing to do with the content.  I figure the best way to go about this now, is to make a copyright claim, but this is where it all gets a bit weird, because the stuff I made, is \u201ctechnically\u201d not my own stuff, because it is made from other peoples material, whom I assume would be considered the \u201creal\u201d copyright owners - but it being public access TV, funded by the state, the rule in Denmark is actually that the actual TV-programs, before I edited them, is public domain - but to my understanding, I would own the rights to the \u201cremix\u201d (being the clips I posted).  So yeah, this is where I\u2019m at. I\u2019m pretty sure the rules for copyright on TikTok are the same all over the world, so I was hoping someone here could help me. How do I go about this? Thank you in advance!\n\nAssistant:"

My sister was informed (by phone) that there is another CPS case made against her (they have two kids). This happened 3mos ago when her ex made false allegations against her. She was investigated, nothing was found, and the case was closed.   He also called the police on her once for abuse. They came by, talked to her and the kids and found nothing wrong.   CPS called my sister today and told her another case has been opened against her. CPS would not tell her who made the allegations. CPS also said they could not tell her the details until they meet on Monday.   My sister called me crying because she is so tired of dealing with this kind of harassment from her ex. It has to be him who called because the only other person the kids interact with over the summer is the younger one's daycare (who has no reason to call). She also has a restraining order against him (for violent threats) that says he should not be using third parties to harass her. But I doubt anyone would enforce this kind of thing.   This is especially stressful because the ex will be getting the kids for a week starting Sunday and who knows what he'll be coaching them on this time.   Last time the kids were with him, the older one started telling me (he can message me with his kindle) all kinds of crazy accusations that came straight from his father's mouth. His father has used the same weird phrases and accusations in the past such as \"you are blinded to the truth,\" which is such a bizarre thing to hear from a 9yo. But, as soon as they are back with my sister, everything is back to normal with them.   She has a free lawyer appointed by a domestic violence shelter.

CPS can\u2019t release the report source to her, but they probably could to the prosecutors office. It might be possible to file something in the restraining order case and ask the court to order the report source revealed or to ask the judge to review the report source in camera, meaning the judge would review them in private and not reveal the info unless they decided it was relevant.   If there is a custody case, evidence of coaching and manipulating the children would be relevant and could be use there to limit visitation or find him in violation of the courts order.

My neighbor, who I'd always had a cordial relationship with prior to this, was mowing his lawn and asked me what I was doing while I was setting up the bee house, and I told him. He freaked out and said that the bees were going to sting his children. I explained to him that mason bees are super gentle, they aren't guarding honey or a hive so they have no need to be aggressive, that they only sting if squished or trapped, and their stings are relatively painless. He was still unhappy. My neighbors became very angry with me and his wife posted about how my bees were dangerous on social media.

My other neighbor has a camera in his backyard and it was able to see my neighbors' son and his friends destroying my bee house and spraying something on my bees that killed them. I work midnight shifts as an essential worker and wasn't home to hear the commotion.   I called the police and the officer was very dismissive, saying \"they were just bees\" and \"you really want a kid to go to jail over bees?\" I got the impression nothing would be done.

I'm 26M she's 25F if that matters at all. Let's call her Ms. Brown. Location is Wisconsin.   I kind of work at a bank. I don't actually work in the bank but I work at a phone center that the bank works with to tell people they're late on payments.  Four years ago I was a real shitheel. I was a stalker and the abuser in an abusive relationship with the abused half being Ms. Brown. I don't really want to go into details. The restraining order was totally deserved is my point and it doesn't expire for quite a while. I'm focusing my life on never being that person again. I go to therapy and anger management and I haven't had any relationships because I'm too afraid of falling back on old habits. I don't interact with Ms. Brown at all and in fact I don't even talk about her with friends and ignore any messages from people who have her friended on facebook. I saw her in person once and immediately turned around and walked away. I'm really trying.   Anyway the past couple weeks one of the accounts that has been assigned for me to call was a woman named Mrs. Grey. The first time, I started my script and got through \"Hello, this is [name]\" before she hung up. She never answered after that so I left four voicemails. (not all on the same day, about two a week. idk if that seems like too much but i was just following policy.) The full script is something like \"Hello this is [name] with [X Bank] and I'm calling about some concerns with your account, please call us back at 1-800-555-BANK to discuss this further.\"  The last time I called (sixth time i guess) she picked up. From the title you can probably figure out what happened. She screamed \"LEAVE ME ALONE, I'VE CALLED THE FUCKING COPS\" and slammed it back down. I recognized her voice and it was all I could do not to actually shit myself a little bit. Yes, Ms. Brown got married and became Mrs. Grey.   I have two questions. First question: can I actually get in legal trouble for this? I really, honestly didn't know it was her. I'm freaking out. Second question: I told my manager right away and he wants me to keep the account and keep calling her even though I know now that it's somebody who has a restraining order against me. Can he do that? Isn't that like hella illegal?   Thanks.\n\nAssistant:"

We live at the end of a street that wraps around and essentially becomes a rectangle with another street. Our house sits on one side of this corner/\u201cend\u201d and our neighbor is directly across from us. He parks a huge RV/his truck in his driveway so his wife has to park her van around the corner on the other street instead of in his driveway.  When we moved in, there was an area outside of our front yard that the curb was clearly not painted and we used it maybe 4-5 times when we had friends visit.   This curb is directly across from his driveway. He asked us one day to not park there anymore because it was hard for his wife to get out of the driveway (whose van never moves from the spot around the corner?) and we agreed to avoid it unless we had guests. He didn\u2019t seem satisfied with our answer but left.  A day or so later we noticed that he had spray painted (literally) the curb yellow overnight so that we couldn\u2019t park there anymore. We just shrugged it off because parking isn\u2019t a huge deal and I\u2019m not about to go to war with a neighbor over something so silly. However, a few days later he spray painted it white, then parked his wife\u2019s van there and it didn\u2019t move for weeks.

Neighbor kids have been told countless times to stop walking along my retaining wall. It surrounds most of my property and at its highest, there is a 4 foot drop. One kid, last year, actually pulled a stone down onto herself and she got her foot out of the way before it crashed down onto the concrete. I had warned her many times to never touch the wall because the top stones aren't secured by concrete, they are secured by their weight. I just went outside and found the same stone on the sidewalk. We have security cameras but due to the fence on top of the wall and it being a corner stone, we don't have footage of the culprit actually doing it. The parents of these kids weren't concerned when their kids carved their names into the wood on my porch, picked all of my flowers or threw trash into my yard so reasoning with the adults is off the table. The kids and adults all know about our security system and that has not been a deterrent.    My main point is, can i be sued if one of these kids does this again and gets hurt? They've been warned so many times over the last few years, i have records of the texts to the parent of the kid who nearly got hurt. Short of standing outside all day, i don't know what to do. I don't want to get sued because some jerky kids refuse to stop trespassing and vandalizing my property.\n\nAssistant:"

We really enjoy the trees for the filtered light and shade they provide for our patio during summer.  I\u2019ve explained that they are free to trim branches on their side as they see fit as long as they don\u2019t damage the tree.  They have done this a few times over the years but have been upset because we wouldn\u2019t pay for it.  We recently moved out of our house to allow prepping the property for sale by painting, carpet, landscaping, etc.  They apparently found out and approached our realtor about taking out the trees.  He declined on our behalf because of the aesthetics they provide for our backyard and patio area.    This morning I showed up to check on the progress of the fixups  and discovered that they absolutely butchered one of the trees, removing every single limb and leaving a 20ft trunk stub.  We clearly can\u2019t put the house up for sale with this ugly thing in the yard and will have to pay to finish the removal process for them in the next several days.  Based on other interactions with them, I believe this \u201ctrimming\u201d was malicious and not an accident.  Some of the branches they cut off were definitely on our side. The trunk slightly curves probably over the property line, but regardless, I understand that they should not be able to materially harm either the health or aesthetics of the tree, both of which clearly happened.  I strongly suspect they used day laborers and not an arborist to perform the work, as they have done that in the past.  Tree is 12+ inches diameter at chest height.  It\u2019s an Ailanthus, which I understand is considered invasive or undesirable in some places.  What recourse do we have for getting them to pay for the remainder of the removal?  I don\u2019t know if removing the tree myself would prejudice the case in some way. Does the tree species matter? We\u2019re moving and remaining friendly with them is not a consideration.

He made some changes and cut it down a bit but here is the approved statement (TL;DR at end for the impatient):  Original post here  So when we left off last, my neighbors had resorted to actually parking on my land in order to block me in and were using the police to try to strong arm me into giving into their demands.  Thanks to the suggestions here, I set up a meeting with a highly recommended real estate lawyer in the area.  We discussed the entire situation and he suggested a few options for trying to resolve this whole mess.  He warned that lawsuits, especially about land rights, can take years and years to work through the courts and of course, that means they cost a fortune.  Instead, as a cheaper and faster alternative, he suggested that the neighbors and we go to what's called \"non-binding mediation\".  As he described it, it's a process where both sides meet and a neutral mediator tries to find a \"middle ground\" that everyone can agree on.  If they do, some sort of contract is written up and everyone signs it.  This way you can avoid the time and expense of a lawsuit.  So we figured, why not give it a shot since there was really nothing to lose at this point.  So my lawyer makes the arrangements with the neighbors directly and although it was not an easy or quick process, they eventually agreed.  Then there were more weeks spent trying to agree on a mediator.  Once that was finally done, we set up a date last week at some other lawyer's conference room for everyone to meet.  My lawyer spent a lot of time preparing and discussing the various possibilities and outcomes and going in, I was super nervous and second guessing the decision not to just file a lawsuit.  But my lawyer was really great and assured that this was the best decision for this kind of situation.  So on the way into the meeting, we get stuck in the elevator together on the way up.  No one says a word and they just looked like they wanted to kill me right there in the office.  We get out and are eventually split into two separate rooms, and are told to meet in the conference room when we were ready.   So after calming me down again, we head into the main room and the mediator, another lawyer, introduces himself to everyone and explains the process.  Immediately, the neighbors start giving him a hard time and asking him questions that basically accused him of working for us.  But he stayed calm and kept repeating that he was neutral and that while he hoped to broker a resolution, he did not work for either side and it was entirely up to the parties how this would end.  And so began World War III, right there in the conference room.  My neighbors, true to form, proved to everyone in the entire building that they were plum crazy with all their red-faced ranting and raving and yelling, most of which was directed at our lawyer and the mediator.  So we get split up into separate rooms again I guess to try to calm things down.  It's now been a half hour in the separate room and I am just about to tell my lawyer to pull the plug on the whole thing when the mediator comes to our room by himself and says he has a proposal.  He explains that he was able to calm the neighbors down and got the feeling that this wasn't just about them landlocking themselves, but rather them feeling that somehow, I had taken advantage of them!    He quickly explained that he did not agree with their \"assessment\" but it was his job to find some middle ground anyway.  So my lawyer asked him what their proposal was.  The mediator says that the neighbors were willing to go after their seller for an \"easement by necessity\" and not use my land (or block my gate), but that they could not currently afford to pay for a lawyer to file the lawsuit they needed.    Worried, I asked what they wanted to get from me out of this whole deal, since this seemed almost too good to be true.  Even my lawyer was surprised.  So the mediator takes a deep breath and warns us that we're probably not going to like the offer, but that it was just the first offer and that everything was still potentially negotiable.  Really worried now, we ask again what the neighbors wanted.  The mediator says \"As I explained, [the neighbors] can't afford to pay for a lawsuit right now, so they would like you to pay for it in exchange for them abandoning their claim to use your land.\"  I was too dumbfounded to even say anything, but my lawyer had the presence of mind to ask just exactly how much these lunatics expected me to pay them to go away.  That's when the mediator pulled his chair up real close to us, leaned in, and said \"about three fiddy\".  And that's right about when I realized that our neighbors were a three hundred foot tall monster from the paleolithic era.  Let this be a lesson to you all - be careful who you ask for updates!  **TL;DR**  Hired lawyer.  Tried to avoid lawsuit via mediation.  Crazy neighbors finally agreed but, as expected, showed their true colors.  Now I need to find change for a dollar.\n\nAssistant:"

Not a lawyer but depending on how the will is exactly worded it could imply only living (at the time of writing) kin rather than kin in perpetuity.

Today I found out they've been lying to me about the purpose of the renovations. A stranger came up to my door assuming I was the owner. He said that he'd been talking to the workers about our dwelling conversion and asked me for my advice on where to source technical drawings and permits for his own garage-to-dwelling conversion.

Basically, the landlord's grandson had lied directly to me but told some rando the truth and that rando then spilled the beans to me on accident.   I confronted my landlord and he told me \"we'd never discussed the garage\" and that I wasn't renting it, he was lending it to me.

I'm a long-time church musician who recently moved to a bigger church with more music budget.  Unfortunately, due to the mismanagement of funds, lack of financial support, and the departure of the music director, the pastor reached out to me and frankly said that they'll have to stop doing weekly rehearsals and reduce my work hours and reduce my annual salary down by half, which won't be enough for me to financially support myself. Apparently, they found someone as an intermittent music director without telling me or the other musicians whom I rehearse with.  This would be utterly devastating, for multiple reasons. I already submitted my offer letter with the original salary, and I don't know what grounds that they have to decimate my salary.  Furthermore, I left my old church of 7 years because of the competitive salary, and at this point, I would not be able to go back, since they already found someone. I feel pretty sick to my stomach, because they told me that they still appreciate my musicianship, and told me all sorts of saccharine bullshit about how this has nothing to do with my skills, but has the audacity to pull this.  I personally don't expect that there can be anything legally done, but what are some actions I can take? In the meantime, I'm looking for other church musician jobs in the area.  The other musicians whom I work and rehearse with me don't know this yet. I could go salted earth route and tell them what has happened, and maybe some of them will depart from the church. Or I don't know. Speak to the media.  Thank you.\n\nAssistant:"

I was out of work for 15 months and never made a single payment during that time.  During this time I got several notices of late payment, notices of pending eviction, and then... nothing.  It never happened.  12 years later I'm still here and I haven't made a single mortgage payment.  As you can imaging during this time I also fell behind on my property taxes.  Eventually I was able to pay off the delinquent taxes, and I've continue to pay them on time every year since.  To be honest, I'm not even sure who owns my house anymore - no one has even mailed me anything about it.  I looked it up on the county records and I'm still listed as the owner.    Now to my question - frankly the house is too big for me now and I'd like to downsize.  My kids have moved out and my wife passed in 2016 - I just don't need this house.  The county thinks I own it, how do I tell them I don't and I've just been living here rent free?

You purchased the house, your name is on the deed, you signed the loan.  12 years ago when everything went downhill you stopped paying the mortgage, but you have paid the property taxes.

Some are recommending a real estate attorney I think you need a consumer debt attorney.    In order to take the property from you, the banks is going to have to take you back to court, at that point you can demand they prove you owe the debt, they have to produce the actual loan documents (or proper copies) of the documents that have your signature.  Statements, your canceled checks none of that actually shows proof (if you are contesting in court) There is a very real chance the paperwork is gone and they have no ability to prove the actual debt.  In that case, you can discharge the lean and sell the house for $450,000 pay your attorney and keep the cash.   This is the best-case scenario and you need an attorney that specializes in debt and foreclosures, and after the mess in 2008 there are a lot of them.  So what's the worst-case scenario?  You walk out of the house, vagrants take over, burn it down and the fire takes out all three of your neighbors and you are on the hook for 1.5 mil.  You need an attorney to guide you, it could be you own the place outright, or you owe more than it is worth.  Only an attorney can really get to the bottom of this, and they can negotiate with the bank.  You might be able to get out with some real money to buy something smaller somewhere else.  They could also get you out with the shirt on your back, but no debt or liability hanging over you and you can walk into something else.     Don't be afraid of your situation, face it head one, get some help and deal with it.  It will help you financially and mentally.  Good luck."

My husband is self-employed and has some tax issues he needs help addressing and also wanted to find a business attorney to work with long term. He called an attorney (on speakerphone - I heard the whole call) two days ago and the call was very strange. The attorney asked him to repeat himself multiple times, gave a quick and dismissive answer, and when my husband began to respond, the attorney said \u201cgoodbye\u201d and hung up on him while he was mid sentence! The whole call was less than 5 minutes.   My husband was rightfully offended by the exchange. I suggested he write a Google review to share his experience. He was very honest in his review and made a couple of goofy jokes at the end (admittedly at the lawyer\u2019s expense), lightening up the situation a bit.   Shortly thereafter, the attorney replied to the Google review with a mostly failed attempt to doxx my husband (multiple phone numbers, address, and email addresses) in the first paragraph, then accused my husband of attempted time theft, shared intimate details of what my husband called about, and finally indicated that Google should not allow the review to remain up because my husband was never a client.  My husband edited his original review to respond, indicating how wrong the attorney was about the situation, clarifying that he had every intention of paying the guy, and suggesting that he may now need to speak to an attorney about being doxxed in response to an honest Google review.   The next morning, the attorney began texting him at 7:30 AM! In the first message, he both 1) offered a 20% discount on his consult meeting fee and 2) threatened to file a lawsuit against my husband on Monday if he didn\u2019t take down his review. Eventually the attorney shared that he has cancer, which felt strange. My husband asked for an amendment to the attorneys public response with an apology in order to take the review down. The attorney refused and said my husband is the one who owes an apology, again making it clear that he plans to sue my husband if the review is not removed. We have left the review up and have no intention of removing it.   Are we in any sort of legal trouble here? It seems to me that any judge would be pretty horrified with the attorney\u2019s behavior but we are not lawyers and don\u2019t know if this could actually somehow get nasty.\n\nAssistant:"

I was told that my son was being suspended for a week, and would be mandated to see a social worker twice a week.

My son was looking really upset at all this, but the vice principal said it was the rules and there was nothing that could be done. I then turned to my son and asked him what he said, and he told me he was flexing his arm muscles in the gym and said 'Look at these guns!'.       Apparently 'gun' is a trigger word that all staff have to report, no matter what the context, and an investigation has to occur before the student is allowed to return. The vice principal reiterated that it could be construed as a threatening statement and that school policy was that he would need to see a social worker twice a week during his recess period.

If you filled out your HIPAA forms and did not explicitly give consent for your father to receive information, then this is a HIPAA breach.

Its entirely possible that your provider handed you a form to sign that said something along the lines of \"You can release my information to anyone you see fit\", and if you signed it, then this is not a breach.    Calling the office and telling them not to contact someone is not the same as revoking consent in writing.  While the office should, in good faith, remove the consent based on the call, there is no paper trail to indicate that the request was made.    My recommended course of action for you would be to go to the office and request a copy of your HIPAA consent paperwork.  They are required to keep this on file.  Review the paperwork and get a copy of it.    Also request a new HIPAA consent form and fill it out accordingly.  Be aware that a provider can still share health information with other providers (known as Covered Entities) without explicit consent.    If the consent form doesn't implicitly or explicitly allow them to disclose information to your father, then you should do two more things.

Depending on what exactly is demised to you in your lease, they may also be able to instal the device on the outside of your premises.   Caveat, I have not read your lease.  It is possible your lease has a general provision in there permitting the landlord to do what he is doing and requiring you to sign the addendum.  This is where a lawyer would be helpful.  While a landlord cannot unilaterally require you to amend your lease, they can seek to enforce an existing provision of the lease that requires you to enter into said addendum/amendment.  This provision might be difficult to parse for a non-lawyer if it exists.

Since this isn't a health or safety issue, your next option is giving written notice that you're moving if he doesn't comply with the lease.

So I live in an apartment in Maryland, and one of my neighbors is this really old lady. In the very few interactions I\u2019ve had with her, she\u2019s come off as \u201cnot all there\u201d, if you catch my drift.  Around a year ago, she left her apartment without turning off the gas burner on her stove, which left the gas leaking throughout our rooms. Half of the people who were present in the building at the time had to get together just to find where the gas was coming from, and this guy had to use a combustible gas leak detector and found it was coming from her apartment while she was gone. We had to wait for her to return and turn it off.  Then a month ago or so, we found the trunk of her car open without anyone around it. We came back 30 mins later and it was still open, all by itself. I can\u2019t see any reason why someone would just leave their trunk open like that, unless they\u2019re having trouble remembering to do basic tasks.  And then today, we went to the parking lot and found the front of her car just COMPLETELY fucked. Not only is the front of the car cracked like shit and the top of it covered with soil, it looks like there\u2019s a thin cinder block literally lodged into the right of her bumper. She just left the car like this.  I don\u2019t think this person is capable of driving responsibly, and might be a danger to herself and the people around her. Is there anything I can do to suspend/revoke her license or otherwise prevent her from hurting others?  Thanks :)\n\nAssistant:"

I have a meeting at 9am tomorrow morning with the Bank president, HR manager, and Ops manager. They sent me home today, with pay, after a brief scolding. They are very angry that I discussed my own and other's pay rates with a fellow employee.  The issue at hand: employee A told several people they had a job offer from a competing bank for $14.75/hr. Employee A told the bank president and so he raised their pay to match the offer. Employee A told me about the raise and that they were not leaving our bank.  I told employee B everything employee A had told me. Employee B has been at the bank several years more than employee A and was furious due to their much lower pay (undisclosed to me).   This morning I was called into a meeting where I was told to leave and my fate would be decided tomorrow morning. I'm not proud that I caused drama, but I also don't feel that I did something to warrant termination with no prior offenses.  As an aside, EVERYONE at the bank discusses other people's salary and wages. I'm not certain why I am the one taking the heat.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Sorry if I left anything of importance out.\n\nAssistant:"

DO NOT tell management that it is illegal to fire you for this until AFTER you have the reason in writing. E-mail, text, etc. WV is, I believe, a one party consent state so I would get a cheap digital recorder or use an app on your phone to record the meeting. Play dumb instead of arguing, make them spell out ***exactly*** why they are firing you. Make them tell you it was wrong.   \"So it is against the rules for employees to discuss their wages?\" Or even better: \"I didn't know it was against the rules for employees to discuss their pay.\" Because these types love to point to some handbook passage or explain in great detail that it IS wrong and they are right to fire you. Give them enough rope to hang themselves.   Then go immediately to an employment attorney and witness the justice boner.   **edit:** This only applies if you can afford to be fired. If not, still try to get it in writing and record the meeting, but IF I needed the job because I was paycheck to paycheck I would fight like hell in that meeting and I would point out that if the NLRA applies then discussing wages is absolutely protected, even discussing third party employee wages. If you need it, tell them they cannot fire you for this and that we should all just go back to normal. Then immediately start looking for a new job."

Hello Reddit, like the title says, I have a neighbour with two dogs, one gra. Sheppard and the other a labradoodle. Neighbour lives easily 500 yards away from me ( in the state of CT) and his dogs are constantly in my yard trying to attack my dog ( docile lab).

If the dogs attack my dog can I technically protect my dog ( i do have a forearms permit). The local PD aren't too bothered and label it a neighbour dispute.          What can I do? If they attack my dog is it legal for me to protect my own pet on my property? What is the legal repercussions for this? Any advice is welcomed.\n\nAssistant:"

I can see multiple possible avenues to prosecution under Florida law, and I suspect you got an officer who didn't want to deal with what they saw as a dumb roommate dispute.  If, ultimately, the police refuse to deal with this, it's true that you could sue your former roommate\u2026 but you'd likely be seeking the fair market value of your dog (which tends to be low, unless you have a purebred in breeding or show condition or a working dog whose value you can corroborate somehow) plus the costs of disposing of the body. It's _possible_ a judge would order punitive damages given the intentional nature of the act and the extreme disregard for safety and for the animal's life, but it's not anywhere near guaranteed."
