Much of Southern culture and identity seems to be focused around patriotism, even while people espouse \"Lost Cause\" ideology. How did this region go from insurrection to fervent patriotism, and how have those two ideas been reconciled so completely in many peoples' minds?  And if I could ask a follow-up question from myself, how come Southern sound and Southern pronunciation became so dominant in popular country music? Did the politically right Northerners willingly accept Southern aesthetics as more authentic, or was there (is there) any reflection on the apparent historical incongruity of this self-identification? (Like Yankees in NY flying Confederate flags on pickup trucks) Do you think Country music might have contributed to this cultural shift, or is it just a side-effect?\n\nAssistant:"

You're going to have a slightly higher transfer of the heat of the oil directly to your food.  I've not done a side-by-side comparison myself, but I'd imagine that if you take a piece of chicken or carrot or whatever, battered one and not the other, then cooked them both to the same doneness, you'll notice a difference in texture, and definitely in flavor. This is an easy test you could do at home. My expectation is that both the carrot and the chicken will have more of a chewy texture, and without the seasoning you might add to the batter/breading. If that makes it better or worse is up to your tastes."

                "content": " Oh hey, something I\u2019ve done research on! I will try to answer this from the Roman perspective. \r   \r   It\u2019s true that Roman gods, to some extent, had certain domains with which they were associated. However, you\u2019re right to be skeptical that it\u2019s as simple as saying that Jupiter was the \u201cgod of thunder\u201d, Juno the \u201cgoddess of marriage\u201d, Pluto the \u201cgod of the dead\u201d, and so on. \r   \r\r   Jupiter did indeed have powers over the sky, but this is just one aspect of what made Jupiter, Jupiter. Another aspect we might look to is the extent to which his worship, and the symbols involved, were seen as relating to the power of the Roman state. The chief priest (\u201c*pontifex maximus*\u201d, a title which has since been claimed by centuries of Popes to the modern day) was a priest of Jupiter. The scepter (*sceptrum*), a symbol of power, was associated with Jupiter (Festus, *De verborum significatione*, 210). When victorious Roman generals led their army in a procession (a triumph) through the city, they wore purple regalia and their faces painted red to embody Jupiter, and their parade ended with them going to the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus (\u201cJupiter the Best and Greatest\u201d) on the Capitoline Hill, a temple he shared with his wife, Juno, and his daughter, Minerva. When consuls (the two chief magistrates) came into office every year, they sacrificed an ox to Jupiter and his will could be discerned through the body parts of the sacrifice \u2013 such as the liver, which Livy mentions as having vanished from one year\u2019s ox, a bad omen (Livy, *Ab urbe condita*, 41.14.7). \r   \r   From these we can see that a large part of Jupiter\u2019s function within the Roman pantheon was as the king of the gods, who could grant legitimacy to the Roman state. In short, to call Jupiter a \u201cgod of thunder\u201d is technically not incorrect, but is quite an oversimplification that misses the nuances of function and meaning associated with his cult in the context of Roman public religion. If you really wanted to simplify things, you would probably be better served thinking of Jupiter as the god who represented the legitimate power of the Roman state rather than as the \u201cgod of thunder\u201d. This better reflects his function as a public cult deity. \r   \r   On top of this, another characteristic of Roman religion was the idea of gods having different aspects. Jupiter, being a rather powerful and important god, was worshipped all over the empire, but in different towns (and even within the city of Rome itself) one might find multiple versions of Jupiter. This can also be said of other public cult deities, such as Mars. Augustus had a temple dedicated to him, or more specifically to Mars Ultor (\u201cMars the Avenger\u201d) no doubt as a message to the Roman public that he had avenged his adoptive father Caesar\u2019s death at the hands of Brutus and his friends. Also in Rome is the Temple of Venus Genetrix (\u201cVenus the Founder\u201d, i.e., of the Julian family; the Julii claimed to be descended from Venus). The different aspects of gods were rather useful for imperial propaganda. \r   \r   Going back to Jupiter himself, there was also a Temple of Jupiter Stator (\u201cJupiter the Sustainer\u201d) in the Campus Martius (\u201cField of Mars\u201d, in the northwest part of the city). His wife, Juno, in addition to being represented in the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, could also be found as Juno Moneta (\u201cJuno the Warner\u201d) guarding the state\u2019s funds in her temple, also on the Capitoline. (The association between Juno Moneta and the state treasury is a likely explanation for the modern day \u201cmonetary\u201d, \u201cmoney\u201d, etc.). \r   \r   Though ostensibly the same god, one temple in one part of Rome, or in another city of the empire, could house within it the worship of Jupiter, Juno, or any other public cult deity in one of many different guises. In fact, some historians have argued that public religion was so tied to civic identity (in other words, the worship of the gods in localized forms was so tied to each individual city or town) that the attempts of emperors like Decius in the 3rd century AD to enforce a more coherent and consistent religious identity were doomed to failure (Rives 1995). It\u2019s worth noting that a fundamental characteristic of ancient religion was its diversity. Indeed, it\u2019s become common among historians of Roman religion to speak not of \u201ca Roman religion\u201d but of plural \u201cRoman religions\u201d which were never really brought together until the rise of Christianity, which concerns itself much more with orthodoxy.    \\[Part 1/3\\]"

I'm nearly halfway through my degree, and I haven't had a single course I've enjoyed outside of a couple of electives.   I haven't been able to find a single other person in my major at my university, and I feel isolated. According to my school's public demographics information, there are other physics majors. I'm just completely cut off from them. I'm also apparently the only woman majoring in physics at my university.

I can remember making up ridiculous problems and solving them for fun, and researching any little thing that interested me. I'd start my day reading papers way above my reading level for most of high school. Now I can barely make it through a paragraph, and I'm too anxious to re-join communities I used to be a part of.

There was also Commerzbank which had again a mostly retail operation in Germany but a thriving IB division in London (I forget who they took over). Commerzbank was being chased by DKB.   Finally there was HVB who were again mostly retail but were aggressively chasing IB business.   Along came Lehmann. The point is that many of the IB operations were run at arm's length so it was really a trigger for something that was probably going to happen anyway.   HVB had  big problems and it finally ended up being taken over by an Italian banking group, Unicredit. DKB had big problems but the Germans did not want to lose another major bank so they looked for a partner, Commerzbank to take over but the insurance business from both went to Allianz. Commerzbank was very active overseas but it had to consolidate it's operations. Deutsche had issues with a joint venture with Commerzbank for property investment called EuroHypo which had major problems with mortgage backed securities. Luckily for Deutsche, the venture was majority owned by Commerz so they took the hit politically but financially Deutsche had issues too. Commerz had government support to take over Dresdner but as a condition they had to keep as many German jobs as possible so they also were forced to curtail their overseas activities.   Underneath the big banks are the regional banks. In general they had a good retail base but were under pressure to increase their returns which is why banks like WestLB started playing in London, but without the boards really being aware of the risk that their investment banking activities worked under. Many of them had big issues.  At the same time the EU was applying pressure on the German government to remove the state guarantees for these banks. So the Landesbank were forced to curtail their activities.   Below that were the savings banks. These go down to the size of individual towns or cities. Effectively they their own corporate investment bank that was called DG at the time (it is now DV or something) . This had existed for a while and was not particularly exciting with their risk taking. They survived fairly well.   First tranche of sources (more will come):    *  Bankers Trust vs Orange County and Proctor & Gample   * Deutsche Bank's Aquisition of Bankers Trust   * Germany's Landebanken in Trouble   * Commerzbank's Aquisition of Dresdener   * German Banking Structures   Source: more to come later, but I have consulted to all of the majors at one time or another in London, Frankfurt and Munich."

What's the point of a right being enumerated in the Constitution if it can be run over on a technicality that the entity violating it isn't actually the government? I can see a future USA run by libertarians where the government does nothing and all governance is done by corporations - who are not restricted by the Constitution and thus can do whatever they want regardless of any \"rights\" identified in the Constitution. So why not start the process of solidifying those rights now? Thus it would be illegal for Facebook or Twitter to ban someone because of their political views (1st amendment), illegal for a business to put up a \"gun free zone\" sign (2nd amendment), illegal for Google to harvest and sell our personal data (4th amendment), and so on. Rights are useless if they are not enforced! Not sure how this would apply to individuals but I guess there might be a way...\n\nAssistant:"
