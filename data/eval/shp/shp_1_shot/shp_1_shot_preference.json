    "\n\nHuman: In the US, why and how Southern culture came to be seen as more authentically American, even though the South lost to the North in the Civil War? I am trying to port this question from /r/AskHistorians, as it falls within the 20 years rule in that sub, while the question is very interesting.  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5tsanz/why_are_the_former_states_of_the_confederacy_now/  Here's what the OP asked:  > Anyone who's driven around the American South has seen the \"Confederate flag\" somewhere, often hanging or flying near an American flag. Much of Southern culture and identity seems to be focused around patriotism, even while people espouse \"Lost Cause\" ideology. How did this region go from insurrection to fervent patriotism, and how have those two ideas been reconciled so completely in many peoples' minds?  And if I could ask a follow-up question from myself, how come Southern sound and Southern pronunciation became so dominant in popular country music? Did the politically right Northerners willingly accept Southern aesthetics as more authentic, or was there (is there) any reflection on the apparent historical incongruity of this self-identification? (Like Yankees in NY flying Confederate flags on pickup trucks) Do you think Country music might have contributed to this cultural shift, or is it just a side-effect?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Is there food science reason (beyond its own flavor and texture) that breading/battering is used when deep frying? Growing up I was never fond of breading on my deep fried foods, and though I've come to enjoy the taste, I now see it removing it as a convenient way to avoid carbs.  But I was curious if the technique is even really required for making, say, fried chicken or fish.   Could I simply season the food I would normally batter, and then drop it into oil to cook?

You're going to have a slightly higher transfer of the heat of the oil directly to your food.  I've not done a side-by-side comparison myself, but I'd imagine that if you take a piece of chicken or carrot or whatever, battered one and not the other, then cooked them both to the same doneness, you'll notice a difference in texture, and definitely in flavor. This is an easy test you could do at home. My expectation is that both the carrot and the chicken will have more of a chewy texture, and without the seasoning you might add to the batter/breading. If that makes it better or worse is up to your tastes."

I am 27F diagnosed with Celiac disease, which led to nutrient malabsorption, which led to osteoporosis, which led to me seeing an endocrinologist.

In short, to call Jupiter a \u201cgod of thunder\u201d is technically not incorrect, but is quite an oversimplification that misses the nuances of function and meaning associated with his cult in the context of Roman public religion. If you really wanted to simplify things, you would probably be better served thinking of Jupiter as the god who represented the legitimate power of the Roman state rather than as the \u201cgod of thunder\u201d.

Jupiter, being a rather powerful and important god, was worshipped all over the empire, but in different towns (and even within the city of Rome itself) one might find multiple versions of Jupiter.

Augustus had a temple dedicated to him, or more specifically to Mars Ultor (\u201cMars the Avenger\u201d) no doubt as a message to the Roman public that he had avenged his adoptive father Caesar\u2019s death at the hands of Brutus and his friends. Also in Rome is the Temple of Venus Genetrix (\u201cVenus the Founder\u201d, i.e., of the Julian family; the Julii claimed to be descended from Venus).

His wife, Juno, in addition to being represented in the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, could also be found as Juno Moneta (\u201cJuno the Warner\u201d) guarding the state\u2019s funds in her temple, also on the Capitoline.

    "\n\nHuman: Burnt out and questioning my degree I'm wrapping up year two of a bachelor's in physics (astro concentration). I'm exhausted and completely disinterested in my studies. I feel hopelessly behind; I had to drop most of my courses this semester, and I was already behind going in. I'm nearly halfway through my degree, and I haven't had a single course I've enjoyed outside of a couple of electives.   I haven't been able to find a single other person in my major at my university, and I feel isolated. According to my school's public demographics information, there are other physics majors. I'm just completely cut off from them. I'm also apparently the only woman majoring in physics at my university.   The interest that got me to pick this major is completely gone- even things that used to be extremely exciting to me are uninteresting or even borderline upsetting. I can remember making up ridiculous problems and solving them for fun, and researching any little thing that interested me. I'd start my day reading papers way above my reading level for most of high school. Now I can barely make it through a paragraph, and I'm too anxious to re-join communities I used to be a part of. Engaging with communities that I used to love online usually just gets me death threats now anyway.   Going into science (especially physics) has been pretty much the only option given to me my whole life. I'm not sure anymore if my love of it was real, or just a way to cope with the pressure. I want to find a way to pick my enthusiasm back up and keep going, but I'm just so hopelessly behind. Even though I usually squeak by with alright grades, I feel like I haven't known what was going on in a math course since 10th grade. Even if I do somehow manage to catch up, none of the careers that could come of my degree interest me. \"Go to school for as long as possible and then go into academia\" has been my only option for as long as I can remember, but now the thought of it makes me sick. But I've looked everywhere I can, and there just doesn't seem to be any option other than academia or a minimum wage job with a physics degree.   This used to be my absolute favourite thing in the world. During especially low points, it was one of the only things that I stayed interested in. But now I'm completely burnt out and I don't think I'm going to be able to get back. I feel like I've lost my last interest and failed at my few remaining skills, and there's nothing left. I don't know what to do. I can't afford to switch majors, and nothing else interests me anyway. I don't have any family to fall back on or anything to be other than a student.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Hey! Hang in there, I am sure you will find a way out of this rut that you're in.  I found myself in your same exact situation in the first semester of my third year of being a physics major:   I was extremely depressed, uninterested in physics, and having a hard time relating to anyone else that was also a physics major. I was working part time while tending to my studies and, while it was one of the hardest decisions I had to make in life, I decided to drop out of college and figure out what the hell I was trying to do with myself. Turns out it ended up being the best decision I could have made. It allowed for a full reset for my mental health, I wasn't overpaying for an education that I wasn't interested in, and I didn't feel pressure from my peers or classes to perform in any certain way. After dabbling with different hobbies and what not during my free time, I went back the next year after discovering I really enjoy electrical engineering. I hadn't even considered engineering and did not know anything about coding, but figured out it was much more compatible with my brain (and still gave me room to appreciate and think about physics more often than not). Additionally, this allowed for me to more effortlessly enjoy my classes, converse with my peers, and make long-term friends (which is so good for your mental health and success in academics).  My advice is if you can take a step back from your academic path to reset, do it! It is such a healthy choice if feasible. Always put your mental health and well-being before a college-level education. Any institution does not need to be making money off of dissatisfied and unwell students and, quite frankly, it is pretty sad that time away from academics isn't encouraged more in our society.  I wish you the best of luck in taking your next life steps. There is no wrong choice you can make and I know you'll find your interest sooner than later :-)",

What's the point of a right being enumerated in the Constitution if it can be run over on a technicality that the entity violating it isn't actually the government? I can see a future USA run by libertarians where the government does nothing and all governance is done by corporations - who are not restricted by the Constitution and thus can do whatever they want regardless of any \"rights\" identified in the Constitution. So why not start the process of solidifying those rights now? Thus it would be illegal for Facebook or Twitter to ban someone because of their political views (1st amendment), illegal for a business to put up a \"gun free zone\" sign (2nd amendment), illegal for Google to harvest and sell our personal data (4th amendment), and so on. Rights are useless if they are not enforced! Not sure how this would apply to individuals but I guess there might be a way...\n\nAssistant:": {
