There are many factors I am trying to take into consideration, but these are the main ones:  * Loss of enthusiasm and passion in the field.      * I started out liking basically anything you could do with computational chemistry and biology and intended to get into computational drug design, but after my first potential advisor left the university I had to transfer departments and join a computational biology lab.      * I didn\u2019t like my initial project on \u201cprotein structure refinement\u201d. My advisor isn\u2019t super familiar with the topic and I was completely overwhelmed with the huge amount of messy data I was dealing with alone. I\u2019ve finally got a grasp on how to deal with the data, and am almost done writing the paper. However the experience really killed my interest in the field as a whole. Projects that I would have been excited to work on a year ago have absolutely no appeal to me anymore.  * I prefer a broadness in knowledge, not depth     * It\u2019s inherent to a PhD to know a great deal about an extremely narrow domain of science. However I prefer spreading my knowledge out across many domains.  * I\u2019m one of those \u201cI want to be called Dr.\u201d people     * I never considered the opportunity cost (especially being in my 20\u2019s) of a PhD when applying. I\u2019ll probably be here for a minimum of 4 more years, based on previous PhD students in this lab.     * As much as I want a doctoral degree, I don\u2019t have a practical use for one.  * I don\u2019t plan on continuing academia (or any research) after graduation.     * I really don\u2019t like most aspects of the academic environment (isolation in research, people who pride themselves on overworking,  etc).      * I would never take a postdoc position, and would be strictly looking in industry for a job. Even in industry I would be weary of any research positions.  * Jobs are mainly in academia, and there are easier paths to any industry job I would be interested in.      * I\u2019m pretty close with my family (in the upper midwest) and want to be geographically close to them (an hour or two drive at most) but PhD level jobs in computational biology are few and far between (mainly on the coasts), and would almost certainly need to move for that.      * The main field I could get into without moving across the country in industry would be data science, which is fairly  obtainable without a PhD. If I market a computational biology masters correct, I could probably a job with a masters alone.  * I have an opportunity for a job if I leave.     * I have a close friend from my chemical engineering undergraduate doing well at a wastewater systems engineering startup and has guaranteed me a job if I should want it.      * I somewhat regret leaving engineering, and could see myself working there.   My apologies for all the text. It\u2019s hard to think clearly about these things through all the sunk cost in the form of time, and  you can\u2019t exactly discuss these things openly with lab members without word spreading. Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!\n\nAssistant:"

There is something to be said for (demonstrating) persistence and finishing the experience, and you're not in a traumatic situation you need to escape from. Not that it can't be a good choice to stop, but the more that choice is driven by a current relatively vague feeling, the more I'd wonder whether there might be something beyond that would be worth exploring.  I'd also quibble about \"depth\" versus \"breadth\" - this may be field-specific but there's definitely a risk of superficiality in my field if someone hasn't dug down on something - the depth also gives you a kind of generalizable insight you don't get without that focus. Once you've been down there, when you know what real, deep knowledge looks like, even if you subsequently branch out you'll bring that awareness/levelness/benchmark with you.  But absolutely nothing wrong with quitting either, and definitely not with refusing to do the post-doc minioning. Especially not if there are positive reasons to pick the alternative, which you seem to have."

Some schools that I'm considering on my job search were founded in / through a religion and explicitly say on their job postings to list in the cover letter how one might assist the school in serving in its mission for higher education, community outreach, all that good stuff, in the spirit of God / the Church / etc.   I can make such a statement, outright and honestly, without the connection to religion. The religion aspect is the distinguishing factor and where I might falter as a job candidate compared to others.

There may or may not be reference to religion/God/faith, and as you mention, these can usually be addressed without reference to personal religious beliefs.  Exception: if it apppears in the Newman Guide, being Catholic is taken much more highly into account.  Other denominations can be a bit hit and miss, but if they are mainline Protestant (Lutheran, Methodist, etc.) they'll likely be similar to Catholic colleges.  Baptist, evangelical, or non-denominational colleges are more likely to want to create a little Christian bubble on campus, and may ask you about your church affiliation or to provide a statement of faith.  However, it is in these colleges' best interests to make it abundantly clear what they are looking for, so it should usually be pretty obvious which ones not to bother applying to."

Many comments here are giving you their own recipes, which I'm sure work well for them, but it's important to keep in mind that because of the nature of macarons, certain recipes work well for certain people based on many different factors. Climate, altitude, oven temperature, technique, even the quality of the ingredients-- many of these things can severely alter the final product of your macaron. Not to mention the differing methods of meringue (mainly italian and french, swiss is rarely used). Even the final taste is easily adjusted with just a few ratio tweaks (sweetness, hardness of shell, etc). In short, there is a reason there are so many different recipes.  Basically, the ideal best results will come from testing and testing and testing. If that's too cost ineffective or you simply don't have the time (the struggle of macarons), then pick a random recipe you like and focus on perfecting your technique. Consistency is key. There are many articles/tutorials out there for perfecting your technique.  Most of the recipes you find will give you a good result. I think the golden rule (if there is not a ratio) is to always use weight measurements-- if there's any sort of volume bull, nope out of there as quickly as you can. It's way too finicky to even bother with trying to keep results consistent.  TL;DR: there is no golden ratio, recipes vary per person, mess around with your own ratios/recipes and/or perfect  your technique AND USE WEIGHT MEASUREMENTS.  Also I am by no means an expert, just a nerd who happens to love the science behind macarons and emptying my bank account buying ingredients for testing.  Edit: woah, reddit silver!

If I'm using my cast iron, this is what I do; with stainless steel, I just use the stove top because the pan handle is not oven safe.    2.) I place a large pat of butter in the pan.  It immediately (and I mean truly immediately, as soon as the butter contacts the pan) turns black as midnight and sends up a smoke signal visible halfway around the globe.    3.) I clean out the pan, put on a fresh pat of butter which doesn't burn now that the pan has cooled a bit, and sear my steak in the freshly cooled pan to a nice, appetizing zombie-flesh grey color before finishing it on the grill.  I used to just grill steaks, but YouTube inspired me to try for that steakhouse seared crust.  But every time I've tried, that's what happens.

I.e. we can neglect elastic deformations, bending, etc. Therefore, its position and its orientation are fully determined by six degrees of freedom - X,Y,Z coordinates and Rx, Ry, Rz rotations (for a fixed global inertial coordinate system, so relative to the ground on earth).  The sensor will give you X,Y,Z, Rx,Ry,Rz (approximately by integrating the accelerations and angular accelerations) of the IMU itself. For instance we can represent this information as a 4x4 homogeneous transformation. Call it T.  (or three rotation matrices and three coordinate displacements etc).  It depends on the DoF (and time) - we can say T(X,Y,Z,Rx,Ry,Rz,t)  The IMU is bonded to the racket so the position vector of any point on the racket is **constant** with respect to a moving coordinate system aligned with the IMU.  Pick an arbitrary point - call it P1 - and its coordinates are constant in the moving CS. Call these coordinates P1\\_m (a 3x1 vector).   To find the position of any point on the racket (say P\\_1), orientation of the racket, etc etc. relative to the global CS (call this P1\\_global), you can just apply the appropriate transformation say P1\\_global = T(X,Y,Z,Rx,Ry,Rz,t)\\*P1\\_m.  Hope that helps.  I've ran hundreds of MSc projects and quite a few PhDs for my students using IMUs, and designing resonant accelerometers/gyroscopes for MEMS IMUs is my research specialty.   For the maths, see  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation\\_matrix#Affine\\_transformations  Edit to add: So yes, you can, if the IMU resolution is good enough for your application."

                "content": " I had a chuckle to see another North Korea flair in this topic of all places. Cheers, /u/koliano!   This isn't my area of expertise, so a really detailed answer is beyond me. However, the Irish famine is a pretty common topic while you're studying periods of mass hunger, and it was something I saw pop up occasionally while reading about the mechanics behind North Korea's famine (1994-1998). There's something that I think might provide some helpful context for your question -- namely, how we study and think about famine has changed a lot over the last 40 years, and the line between \"genocide\" and \"famine\" has gotten blurrier as we recognize that famine is not really an accident.  So -- was the Irish \"potato famine\" a genocide against the Irish?  **Short answer:** The English didn't commit genocide by the strictest definition of the term, but they did create the circumstances that led to the famine.  **Long answer:** As others have pointed out, there's a troublesome and often politically-charged distinction to be made between genocide and famine:   - **Genocide implies intent.** It's not enough for millions of people to die: Somebody has to *want them dead* and engineer a way to do it, or capitalize on a situation likely to result in mass death. Nobody wants to be told they were responsible for genocide; it's a severe blow to the moral and political authority of the country involved. The Turks resist efforts to characterize what the Armenians call the \"Great Crime\" as genocide. Russia will tell you to fuck off when you raise the issue of the Holodomor and Stalin's being a huge asshole to the Ukrainians. The Chinese government only recently stopped censoring public discussion of the famine related to the Great Leap Forward. Nobody wants to admit to having committed genocide or -- if it's not genocide by the technical definition of the term -- anything that looks like it.  - By contrast, **famine is seen as a tragedy that nobody could have prevented.** Crops fail. Drought happens. Diseases, predators, and wildfires kill livestock. Earthquakes and floods destroy your ability to move food around. Something bad happens that interferes with your society's ability to grow, store, or transport food, and lots of people die despite your best efforts. Famine is the second horseman of the apocalypse, perennial as the grass, cold and grimly present as its brothers pestilence, war, and death. It is ubiquitous in human history and the immutable lesson is that it can happen to anyone.  Except it doesn't. Certain human societies have been strangely resistant to famine despite weathering the same shocks that caused mass starvation in similar circumstances elsewhere.   Historians and economists had a collective \"Eureka!\" moment in the late 20th century when we realized that famine DOESN'T just happen, and that it probably never has. Hunger can happen despite your best efforts to prevent it, but *famine is the result of politics*.  **Before we go any farther, we need to talk about a guy named Amartya Sen.** He's an Indian economist and historian who's written a lot of really famous and influential pieces about a variety of topics, and he was awarded the 1999 Nobel Prize for his work on welfare economics. In terms of popular reach, he's probably best-known for a 1990 essay on \"More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing,\" which addressed the result of sex-selective abortions in Asia. However, in the academic world he's arguably most famous for his work on famine in human history, and in particular a theory that sounds bananas when you first hear it, and then more and more frighteningly plausible.  I'll break it into two parts:    - **Sen argued that no famine over the last 1,000 years can be attributed to anything other than primarily man-made causes.** This took a while to get traction; we're used to saying that X famine was caused by a flood, or Y famine happened because of a drought, etc. Sen pointed out that natural disasters and crop failures are actually pretty common, but famines aren't usually the result. Left to their own devices, humans are pretty good at finding and storing food as proof against unpredictable shortages. In order to create a famine, you have to have a bad, unstable, and/or corrupt political/economic system that can't weather a sudden shock and is thrown into crisis. We've gotten used to blaming the shock (e.g., the flood, the drought), when in reality it's just a convenient excuse. The real cause is the shitty and inflexible system that existed before it.   - **Sen further argued that no famine has occurred in a democracy with a free press.** The basic idea is that government that isn't accountable to its people is notoriously unresponsive to its needs, and a free press is good at noticing and publicizing problems that government needs to address. There have been some quibbles over this, mostly related to pockets of continuing hunger in India, but for the most part this is a pretty uncontroversial theory.  Sen published his first work on famine in 1981 and has studied the issue on and off since. His work has heavily colored subsequent discussions of hunger and the political systems that create/d it, and it's a big part of the reason we're disposed to evaluate past famines differently these days. Interestingly, the 1981 piece is primarily about another famine that the British had a hand in (the 1943 Bengal famine) due to rice and transport ship confiscations setting off a price panic.  **So let's consider the Irish potato famine :** Again, I have to leave the nitty-gritty details to someone with a better command of this period than I've got, but I can tell you about the commentary that the Irish famine attracts when historians and statisticians are discussing the mechanics of hunger in modern works.  The potato blight has been commonly cited as the reason that the famine happened, and it's entirely true that it played a role. The lack of genetic diversity among the strain of potatoes being grown in Ireland at the time made the island incredibly susceptible to the blight. However, it was a classic example of a \"shock\" that revealed the underlying corruption in the economic system that surrounded it. The blight may have started the famine, but it didn't actually cause it (if that distinction makes any sense).  **So what did cause it?** Britain's Corn Laws were an aggressively protectionist series of tariffs enacted with the intent to keep grain prices high for the benefit of domestic producers. (TL:DR: Landowners didn't want to compete against cheap grain from abroad and also had to pay their farm laborers a living wage, so Parliament levied high taxes on foreign grain and tweaked them as necessary to try to bump domestic grain to what they considered ideal prices.) The Irish poor (of whom there were many, for a variety of very complicated historical and socioeconomic reasons) were largely unable to afford grain as a result of the Corn Laws, and on the generally-small holdings they farmed (for which they paid punitive rents to largely absentee English landlords) could only grow potatoes in sufficient quantity to feed their families.   The potato was thus the staple food, and the blight an utter catastrophe. When potatoes were no longer available, the poor burned through their meager savings quickly to buy grain, and when that ran out, they starved en masse. Parliament repealed the Corn Laws two years into the famine, but it was too little and too late, and also didn't address the other systemic issues (principally landlord exploitation) that contributed to the famine.  So it's pretty apparent why the genocide/famine distinction is a touchy one here:    - **Did the English commit genocide against the Irish?** Not as such.   - **Did they create the circumstances that led to the famine?** Yes, and most historians judge the government's response to the famine as woefully inadequate, to compound the issue."

The resultant popularity of Omaha Beach in media after the fact is due in no small part due to films like *The Longest Day* and the Beach's spectacular (yet fictionalized) depiction in Steven Spielberg's 1998 film *Saving Private Ryan* and subsequent depictions of the scene as missions in video games, some of which bear a striking resemblance to the film. Polls of people in European countries such as this one for France show a trend where public opinion has shifted more in favor of America's role in WWII.  General Omar Bradley, commander of First Army, seriously considered abandoning landings at Omaha Beach midway through the assault (unbeknownst to him, by 0900 small groups of American troops had made it past the bluffs and were attacking German defensive strongpoints from the rear) and re-routing his remaining forces through Utah or one of the British or Canadian beaches;  > I reluctantly contemplated the diversion of Omaha follow-up forces to Utah and the British beaches  Casualties at Omaha Beach were very severe in comparison to the other four landing beaches. Casualties on the beach itself ranged anywhere from 2,000 to 4,700; the exact total may never be known due to imprecise or incomplete record-keeping or the fact that many men, drowned by the weight of their equipment, sank to the bottom of the sea, or simply disappeared after being caught in German artillery bursts, never to be seen again.

U.S. Navy units attached to Engineer Special Brigades are not included in this total.  Another reason that Omaha Beach is particularly well-known is because of the 2nd Ranger Battalion's daring mission to scale the sheer cliffs at Pointe du Hoc using grapnel hooks and rope ladders and destroy German artillery pieces located there, and then defend against German counterattacks until relieved. The Rangers suffered heavy losses during the initial assault and subsequent defense, but succeeded in their mission. The armor (especially the DD tanks) launched at Omaha Beach generally also fared very poorly in comparison to the other beaches, being launched too far out and getting caught in the swift current;  Division|DD Tank Unit|Beach|Tanks embarked|Tanks launched into sea|Tanks discharged directly onto beach|Tanks sunk after launch or not landed|Notes :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:-- 3rd Br Inf Div|13th/18th Royal Hussars (Queen Mary's Own)|Sword|38|32|5|**4**|3 tanks sunk after launch, 1 not launched 3rd Cdn Inf Div|6th Cdn Armoured Regt (1st Cdn Hussars)|Juno|40|30|10|**5**|10 tanks were deposited directly on the beach after their LCTs were damaged 3rd Cdn Inf Div|10th Cdn Armoured Regt (Fort Garry Horse)|Juno|40|20|20|**0**|20 sea-launched and 20 deposited directly on beach 50th Br Inf Div|4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards|Gold|40|0|40|**0**|Deposited directly on beach 50th Br Inf Div|Nottinghamshire Yeomanry (Sherwood Rangers)|Gold|40|40||**0**|All swam in successfully 1st US Inf Div|741st Tk Bn|Omaha|32|29|3|**27**|3 tanks were deposited directly on the beach after their LCT was damaged; 27 of the 29 sea-launched tanks sunk 29th US Inf Div|743rd Tk Bn|Omaha|32||32|**0**|Deposited directly on beach 4th US Inf Div|70th Tk Bn|Utah|32|28||**5**|1 tank sunk after launch, 4 lost when LCT hit and was sunk  In contrast, Juno Beach inflicted around 1,000 casualties on the attacking 3rd Canadian Infantry Division (340 dead, 574 wounded, 47 captured in the Division only) Gold Beach caused around 1,000 casualties to *all* British units attacking the beach.

The kinetic energy of the projectile, while large, is insignificant compared to the actual payload.  I actually wrote an executive-level summary of railgun physics and their operation for a high-level program manager working for the Navy. (None of this involved classified material.) One potential issue is that railguns tend to use very dense materials for their projectiles, which are liable to penetrate through targets rather than deliver energy to them. This is easily solved by modifying the projectile to *scatter many smaller projectiles* near the target.   As u/jehan60188 says, 4 MJ/kg is the threshold for railgun superior effectiveness. Once the projectile is fast enough it is more effective to use the kinetic energy of the projectile rather than use (chemical) explosives. As kinetic energy scales essentially without limit with respect to velocity, railguns are inevitably more effective. They are not, *yet*, more effective, which is what motivates continuing naval research on the subject.   Chemical explosives provide a fundamental limit on the effectiveness of traditional guns, either through explosive or kinetic payloads. (There is a similar limit to the effectiveness of chemical rockets.) Electromagnetic propulsion, on the other hand, suffers from no such limit."

When investor confidence falters, for whatever reason, the economy plunges into recession.     * Austrians think that erratic Federal Reserve interest rate policy causes recessions. The Fed will reduce interest rates to spark a boom, but this leads investors to over-commit capital  to risky projects in their chase for yield. Austrians call this phenomenon \"malinvestment.\" These malinvestments then go bad, leading to recession. The boom contains the seeds of its own destruction.  2. *What should we do about it?*     * Keynesians think that active government policy can manage aggregate demand. In the simplest story, when investor confidence falters, the government can step in and fill the demand gap. When investor spirits are high, the government cuts back. This leads to stability in overall expenditure, thus smoothing out the business cycle.     * Austrians think we need tight restrictions on the Federal Reserve, because it's the Fed's fault to begin with for trying to engineer a boom. Thus we need to put restrictions in place, such as some kind of commodity standard to \"tie the Fed's hands\" and make sure it can't do anything too awful to the economy.     * Austrians also believe that countercyclical policy is wrongheaded: if the government steps in to prop up demand, then those malinvestments won't be liquidated, and one just prolongs the imbalance. If the Fed does screw up and plunge us into recession, the best course of action is to let the recession ride out and clear up any malinvestment. Engaging in countercyclical policy just prolongs the bleeding.  There's an intro. Let me know if you want more information. Neither of these schools of thought is right, in my estimation. :)"

                "content": " This is an effect of activating your sympathetic nervous system. Basically, your nerves have two settings: sympathetic (fight or flight) and parasympathetic (rest and digest). Both systems are active harmoniously, but the balance can be shifted in response to the environment.  When you're just sitting there chilling, the parasympathetic nervous system is dominant. This emphasizes functions such as digestion.  When something triggers it, such as seeing your crush, or being chased by a bear, or trying to kill a wasp that flew into your car when you rolled the windows down and now you're flailing for dear life, a hormone surge and the sympathetic nervous system becomes dominant. The physiological effects of this are what someone might describe as an adrenaline rush.  Some physiological effects of the sympathetic system are pupil dilation, increase in heart rate and contractility, and  dilation of blood vessels in your skeletal muscles and extremities which diverts blood flow away from your gut, slowing digestion."

So my yard goes pretty close to the neighbor\u2019s concrete pad where they have a basketball court set up. Neighborhood kids always go there to play and usually leave their bikes and things on my grass. It\u2019s not that big of a deal except I have had to ask them to move there stuff several times when I\u2019m mowing.   This is the first time I\u2019ve mowed this year and the grass is a few inches higher than it should be. Anyway, a kid comes over and I\u2019m mowing but he still puts the basketball he brought with him down in my grass.  I get to the basketball and just decide I can nudge it with the front of the mower and out of the way. I made eye contact with the kid several times waiting for him to move it before I got there and he never did so I figured \u201cwhatever, it\u2019ll roll.\u201d  Well I bump it with my mower over to a section of mower grass and as I continue forward past where it was there was a loud clunking and crackling like I\u2019d just run over a rock. The rock turned out to be his iPhone.   He was upset obviously that his phone was broken and I did feel bad but my thought was that he should\u2019ve said something or moved it before I got there.  He goes home and about thirty minutes later his mom shows up and tells me I broke it and am responsible for replacing it, that I should have told him to move his stuff because I am the adult.  I tell her I\u2019m sorry about the phone and politely decline her request. She just says \u201cI promise you WILL be paying for it.\u201d And then storms off. I\u2019m not really sure what her next course of action is or what she plans to do. She mentioned something about she has a friend that\u2019s a lawyer, so I guess she could take me to civil court?  Am I legally responsible for replacing the phone? Would it be cheaper than court costs if she did choose to take me to court?\n\nAssistant:"

I have her on camera walking onto my property multiple times and ultimately picking up and taking two large potted plants.  I am in the state of Washington, and my understanding is that this is, at a minimum, criminal trespassing (RCW 9A.52.080) but she also stole things which I can\u2019t find an applicable law for since all the burglary laws (RCW 9A.52.020 - RCW 9A.52.030) seem to apply to entering a dwelling.  I don\u2019t believe any of the defenses to criminal trespassing (RCW 9A.52.090) could apply since I\u2019ve only spoken to her one time when I moved in a few months ago and have never given her permission to walk onto my property.   The plants were near my trash cans but not out near the street or anything indicating that they were free for taking, and the plants have been there for months, since that\u2019s where I keep them. So it seems she could try to claim the defense:   *\u201c(3) The actor reasonably believed that the owner of the premises, or other person empowered to license access thereto, would have licensed him or her to enter or remain;\u201d*  but there was no indication that the plants were up for the taking. I also have a photo of me watering the plants showing they are my and are on my property.  So what are my options? Confront them and if they lie then tell them I have a video? Go straight to the police with the evidence? I know they are \u201cjust plants\u201d, but they are mine, they are important to me, and I feel very violated by her taking them.\n\nAssistant:"
