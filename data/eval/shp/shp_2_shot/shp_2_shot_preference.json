    "\n\nHuman: When to know you should master out of a PhD I\u2019m in my third year of graduate school (second year in my program, I switched from Medicinal chemistry/pharmacology to Biophysical and computational biology after my first year) and am seriously considering leaving with a masters at the end of this year. There are many factors I am trying to take into consideration, but these are the main ones:  * Loss of enthusiasm and passion in the field.      * I started out liking basically anything you could do with computational chemistry and biology and intended to get into computational drug design, but after my first potential advisor left the university I had to transfer departments and join a computational biology lab.      * I didn\u2019t like my initial project on \u201cprotein structure refinement\u201d. My advisor isn\u2019t super familiar with the topic and I was completely overwhelmed with the huge amount of messy data I was dealing with alone. I\u2019ve finally got a grasp on how to deal with the data, and am almost done writing the paper. However the experience really killed my interest in the field as a whole. Projects that I would have been excited to work on a year ago have absolutely no appeal to me anymore.  * I prefer a broadness in knowledge, not depth     * It\u2019s inherent to a PhD to know a great deal about an extremely narrow domain of science. However I prefer spreading my knowledge out across many domains.  * I\u2019m one of those \u201cI want to be called Dr.\u201d people     * I never considered the opportunity cost (especially being in my 20\u2019s) of a PhD when applying. I\u2019ll probably be here for a minimum of 4 more years, based on previous PhD students in this lab.     * As much as I want a doctoral degree, I don\u2019t have a practical use for one.  * I don\u2019t plan on continuing academia (or any research) after graduation.     * I really don\u2019t like most aspects of the academic environment (isolation in research, people who pride themselves on overworking,  etc).      * I would never take a postdoc position, and would be strictly looking in industry for a job. Even in industry I would be weary of any research positions.  * Jobs are mainly in academia, and there are easier paths to any industry job I would be interested in.      * I\u2019m pretty close with my family (in the upper midwest) and want to be geographically close to them (an hour or two drive at most) but PhD level jobs in computational biology are few and far between (mainly on the coasts), and would almost certainly need to move for that.      * The main field I could get into without moving across the country in industry would be data science, which is fairly  obtainable without a PhD. If I market a computational biology masters correct, I could probably a job with a masters alone.  * I have an opportunity for a job if I leave.     * I have a close friend from my chemical engineering undergraduate doing well at a wastewater systems engineering startup and has guaranteed me a job if I should want it.      * I somewhat regret leaving engineering, and could see myself working there.   My apologies for all the text. It\u2019s hard to think clearly about these things through all the sunk cost in the form of time, and  you can\u2019t exactly discuss these things openly with lab members without word spreading. Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: How does being non-religious affect chances of getting a job or tenure at a Catholic or other religious university? I am not a religious person. It's not a matter of atheist or agnostic or anything like that; I just didn't grow up with it and it's foreign to me.   Some schools that I'm considering on my job search were founded in / through a religion and explicitly say on their job postings to list in the cover letter how one might assist the school in serving in its mission for higher education, community outreach, all that good stuff, in the spirit of God / the Church / etc.   I can make such a statement, outright and honestly, without the connection to religion. The religion aspect is the distinguishing factor and where I might falter as a job candidate compared to others.  The simple question is, given my background, am I just better off not looking at religion-focused schools?  More in depth: what are the general religion knowledge expectations of a faculty member who is not of the same faith (or any faith) as the school?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: How can you make a skillet or pan hot enough to sear a crust into a steak without burning the butter? Every time I have ever tried to do the classic butter-basted crusty steak, the following happens:  1.) I get the pan really hot.  Most of the tutorials I've watched recommend placing it in a 400-500F oven for 10 minutes.  If I'm using my cast iron, this is what I do; with stainless steel, I just use the stove top because the pan handle is not oven safe.    2.) I place a large pat of butter in the pan.  It immediately (and I mean truly immediately, as soon as the butter contacts the pan) turns black as midnight and sends up a smoke signal visible halfway around the globe.    3.) I clean out the pan, put on a fresh pat of butter which doesn't burn now that the pan has cooled a bit, and sear my steak in the freshly cooled pan to a nice, appetizing zombie-flesh grey color before finishing it on the grill.  I used to just grill steaks, but YouTube inspired me to try for that steakhouse seared crust.  But every time I've tried, that's what happens.  I've tried not getting the pan as hot or heating the butter in the pan, but the pan never gets hot enough to sear the steak without cooking it through first.  I've tried fats with higher smoke points, and they work, but I miss that rich butter-basted flavor.  How do I fix this?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " wait til AFTER you sear to baste. No fats should go into the pan til after.   Try this: Sear the salted and peppered meat DRY. First one side til it releases on its own. Then the other. Til it releases on its own. Roughly 2-3 minutes per side.   THEN sear the fat cap. about 30 seconds.   Then roast in 400 degree oven for no more than 8 minutes.   THEN BUTTER BASTE. Stove top on medium, just to get butter melty and spoonable. Butter will not turn black, aromatics will infuse into it properly and then you will have a steak to be proud of.

            " I am all CI, all the time, for steak searing, so can only speak to that method.  As on overall goal/plan, you want a really hot, non stick-ish surface for the immediate sear, then butter basting later when the main browning has happened and you are just flavoring the crust.    I preheat a CI skillet for each steak or two (T-bones are big enough for one per; rib eyes can usually share real estate. I heat the CI in the oven for closer to 30 minutes, but I start in a cold oven for no better reason than convenience; there may be some small technical metallurgical advantage is heating the CI from room temp a bit more slowly as well, but convenience is my real drive, even though I live with a blacksmith who obsesses over thermal shock.  Prep your steak as you prefer to ensure that as little water (steam) is in play when it hits the skillet as possible.  Folks have strong opinions that work for them to make happy tummies; use the prep approach that makes happy tummies in your family.  I like salting well 24-ish hours out and leaving uncovered in the fridge, but I do not plan to die on that hill.    I think clean up is easier if you brush your prepared steak with a neutral oil, rather than adding oil to the pan.  That free oil which is 2 inches from the steak in the skillets is going to land on your stove and countertop and apparently breed, because I swear that I clean up a cup of oil droplets for every 2T oil used, if I put oil in the hot skillet.    The sequence is (1) preheat the skillets in a 450F-ish oven, starting from cold; (2) pat any surface moisture from the steaks and brush one side with oil; (3) cut on my electric burners on high to preheat; (4) put the skillets on the preheated eyes and plop the oiled side of the steak onto the skillets; (5) oil the top side of the steaks; and (6) apply some judgement to how long I want those steaks to cook, informed by their thickness and fat content and by eater preference for degree of doneness.  I aim for 1/4 of the cooking time on each side (that's half the time) then adding butter to do 1/4 of the time for each side (the other half of the time), basting in butter or a compound butter.    The steaks generally cool the pan quite a bit and I turn down the heat for the second half of cooking because I am just refining the sear that was already created.  Almost always, I have unburned butter and lovely sucs - omit any skillet where there is significant burning in the next step.  While the steaks rest a few minutes, I make a simple sauce by deglazing each pan and combining all the skillets' results into one, stirring in any prepared or desired \"stuff\", like tarragon or chopped cooked mushrooms or a mustard or whatever suits my notion and pandemic staples.    I think the slower, longer heating of the CI and the avoidance of any extra oil are the things that make this approach work well for home cooking.  I do commend a silicone oil brush, because you can just run it through the dishwasher.  I also should caution you that the longer CI preheating does degrade your seasoning, so you should plan a fried dish soon in those skillets, darn!",

That free oil which is 2 inches from the steak in the skillets is going to land on your stove and countertop and apparently breed, because I swear that I clean up a cup of oil droplets for every 2T oil used, if I put oil in the hot skillet.    The sequence is (1) preheat the skillets in a 450F-ish oven, starting from cold; (2) pat any surface moisture from the steaks and brush one side with oil; (3) cut on my electric burners on high to preheat; (4) put the skillets on the preheated eyes and plop the oiled side of the steak onto the skillets; (5) oil the top side of the steaks; and (6) apply some judgement to how long I want those steaks to cook, informed by their thickness and fat content and by eater preference for degree of doneness.  I aim for 1/4 of the cooking time on each side (that's half the time) then adding butter to do 1/4 of the time for each side (the other half of the time), basting in butter or a compound butter.    The steaks generally cool the pan quite a bit and I turn down the heat for the second half of cooking because I am just refining the sear that was already created.  Almost always, I have unburned butter and lovely sucs - omit any skillet where there is significant burning in the next step.  While the steaks rest a few minutes, I make a simple sauce by deglazing each pan and combining all the skillets' results into one, stirring in any prepared or desired \"stuff\", like tarragon or chopped cooked mushrooms or a mustard or whatever suits my notion and pandemic staples.    I think the slower, longer heating of the CI and the avoidance of any extra oil are the things that make this approach work well for home cooking.  I do commend a silicone oil brush, because you can just run it through the dishwasher.  I also should caution you that the longer CI preheating does degrade your seasoning, so you should plan a fried dish soon in those skillets, darn!",
            " You butter baste when finishing the steak not when searing. Get the pan hot but not too hot. Add oil, pat the steak dry and season. Place in pan. Sear both side well( several minutes a side) and place in a hot oven. If you want rare pull when 110, med rare 120 and so on. Put on high heat and add a bunch of butter and whatever else you want. The key is to add a lot of butter and keep it moving. The  water in the butter and the volume of it lowers the temp enough it doesnt burn too fast as long as you keep basting. When it starts browning you're done. Rest your meat and serve. I've done this 1000's of times during service in restaurants."

        "sft_target": " wait til AFTER you sear to baste. No fats should go into the pan til after.   Try this: Sear the salted and peppered meat DRY. First one side til it releases on its own. Then the other. Til it releases on its own. Roughly 2-3 minutes per side.   THEN sear the fat cap. about 30 seconds.   Then roast in 400 degree oven for no more than 8 minutes.   THEN BUTTER BASTE. Stove top on medium, just to get butter melty and spoonable. Butter will not turn black, aromatics will infuse into it properly and then you will have a steak to be proud of. Don't forget to let it rest.",
        "rejected_target": " I am all CI, all the time, for steak searing, so can only speak to that method.  As on overall goal/plan, you want a really hot, non stick-ish surface for the immediate sear, then butter basting later when the main browning has happened and you are just flavoring the crust.    I preheat a CI skillet for each steak or two (T-bones are big enough for one per; rib eyes can usually share real estate. I heat the CI in the oven for closer to 30 minutes, but I start in a cold oven for no better reason than convenience; there may be some small technical metallurgical advantage is heating the CI from room temp a bit more slowly as well, but convenience is my real drive, even though I live with a blacksmith who obsesses over thermal shock.  Prep your steak as you prefer to ensure that as little water (steam) is in play when it hits the skillet as possible.  Folks have strong opinions that work for them to make happy tummies; use the prep approach that makes happy tummies in your family.

    "\n\nHuman: Historically, was hummus always smooth? I've tried to find some history around it that answers my question but I fail to find anything substantial (and by searching the title question I get results a-la \"how to make silky-smooth hummus in 3 easy steps!\" which is off the bat).  There were no electric food processors around in the 13th century, not even a century ago! Did people in the Middle East work their chickpeas with mortar and pestle for hours to get lumpless hummus? I dunno. I fail to see how anyone could have cared before the age of electronics.   My curiosity comes partially inspired from recipes following \"authentic hummus\" recipes where the standard is the silky, cream-like consistency, as if silently it's become a taboo for hummus to have any other texture, not even small chickpea bits. Surely 300 years ago nobody realy cared, or at least I think so? When did everyone switch to \"authentic == absolutely no detectable pieces\" mentality?  Thank you!\n\nAssistant:": {

No, but wealthy people could have whole teams of kitchen staff in their households, and even poorer people typically had one dedicated homemaker in a married couple (not that I know much about domestic relations in the thirteenth century in the parts of the world where hummus comes from, so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).

Last week at the vets she was an angel, but today the demon came out during an injection and she bit me twice, on my index finger and middle finger. The vet sprayed antiseptic and bandaged my fingers after this happened. I took the bandages off at home.  The index finger is more or less ok, a bit of tenderness and swelling, but its not bad. The middle finger is much worse, it hurts and is warm and swollen; it really hurts when I try to bend it. It was oozing clear/yellow liquid for a few hours from the puncture (looked like urine). The oozing has stopped now.  I'm thinking perhaps I should get a prescription for an antibiotic, but my husband says I'm overreacting.   What's the best course of action here?\n\nAssistant:": {

She doesn\u2019t take any medications, she vapes and drinks alcohol, and she doesn\u2019t have any significant medical diagnoses.  I\u2019m concerned because she\u2019s shotgunning redbulls multiple times per week, and sometimes multiple times per day. I\u2019m a medic in the Air National Guard, and I\u2019m also a medical technician in a hospital. I\u2019ve tried to explain to her how awful this is but she just keeps making jokes about it. I was wondering if I could get a provider (APRN, MD, DO, DNP, etc.) to explain possible complications of this so that way I could send it to her to try to get it through her thick skull that this is bad. Thank you so much in advance, and have a blessed day!\n\nAssistant:": {

Given the accelerometer and gyroscope readings from a 6DoF IMU sensor attached to the buttcap of a tennis racket, and the fact that the head of the racket is in a known direction relative to the sensor and has a fixed distance (buttcap-to-tip of rackethead), I am hoping to calculate the speed of the head of the racket.    Given that the \"lever\" in this scenario is of variable length (human arm + racket, arm in varying degrees of extension), and that the sensor would technically be some length away from the point of rotation.

            " I had a chuckle to see another North Korea flair in this topic of all places. Cheers, /u/koliano!   This isn't my area of expertise, so a really detailed answer is beyond me. However, the Irish famine is a pretty common topic while you're studying periods of mass hunger, and it was something I saw pop up occasionally while reading about the mechanics behind North Korea's famine (1994-1998). There's something that I think might provide some helpful context for your question -- namely, how we study and think about famine has changed a lot over the last 40 years, and the line between \"genocide\" and \"famine\" has gotten blurrier as we recognize that famine is not really an accident.  So -- was the Irish \"potato famine\" a genocide against the Irish?  **Short answer:** The English didn't commit genocide by the strictest definition of the term, but they did create the circumstances that led to the famine.  **Long answer:** As others have pointed out, there's a troublesome and often politically-charged distinction to be made between genocide and famine:   - **Genocide implies intent.** It's not enough for millions of people to die: Somebody has to *want them dead* and engineer a way to do it, or capitalize on a situation likely to result in mass death. Nobody wants to be told they were responsible for genocide; it's a severe blow to the moral and political authority of the country involved. The Turks resist efforts to characterize what the Armenians call the \"Great Crime\" as genocide. Russia will tell you to fuck off when you raise the issue of the Holodomor and Stalin's being a huge asshole to the Ukrainians. The Chinese government only recently stopped censoring public discussion of the famine related to the Great Leap Forward. Nobody wants to admit to having committed genocide or -- if it's not genocide by the technical definition of the term -- anything that looks like it.  - By contrast, **famine is seen as a tragedy that nobody could have prevented.** Crops fail. Drought happens. Diseases, predators, and wildfires kill livestock. Earthquakes and floods destroy your ability to move food around. Something bad happens that interferes with your society's ability to grow, store, or transport food, and lots of people die despite your best efforts. Famine is the second horseman of the apocalypse, perennial as the grass, cold and grimly present as its brothers pestilence, war, and death. It is ubiquitous in human history and the immutable lesson is that it can happen to anyone.  Except it doesn't. Certain human societies have been strangely resistant to famine despite weathering the same shocks that caused mass starvation in similar circumstances elsewhere.   Historians and economists had a collective \"Eureka!\" moment in the late 20th century when we realized that famine DOESN'T just happen, and that it probably never has. Hunger can happen despite your best efforts to prevent it, but *famine is the result of politics*.  **Before we go any farther, we need to talk about a guy named Amartya Sen.** He's an Indian economist and historian who's written a lot of really famous and influential pieces about a variety of topics, and he was awarded the 1999 Nobel Prize for his work on welfare economics. In terms of popular reach, he's probably best-known for a 1990 essay on \"More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing,\" which addressed the result of sex-selective abortions in Asia. However, in the academic world he's arguably most famous for his work on famine in human history, and in particular a theory that sounds bananas when you first hear it, and then more and more frighteningly plausible.  I'll break it into two parts:    - **Sen argued that no famine over the last 1,000 years can be attributed to anything other than primarily man-made causes.** This took a while to get traction; we're used to saying that X famine was caused by a flood, or Y famine happened because of a drought, etc. Sen pointed out that natural disasters and crop failures are actually pretty common, but famines aren't usually the result. Left to their own devices, humans are pretty good at finding and storing food as proof against unpredictable shortages. In order to create a famine, you have to have a bad, unstable, and/or corrupt political/economic system that can't weather a sudden shock and is thrown into crisis. We've gotten used to blaming the shock (e.g., the flood, the drought), when in reality it's just a convenient excuse. The real cause is the shitty and inflexible system that existed before it.   - **Sen further argued that no famine has occurred in a democracy with a free press.** The basic idea is that government that isn't accountable to its people is notoriously unresponsive to its needs, and a free press is good at noticing and publicizing problems that government needs to address. There have been some quibbles over this, mostly related to pockets of continuing hunger in India, but for the most part this is a pretty uncontroversial theory.  Sen published his first work on famine in 1981 and has studied the issue on and off since. His work has heavily colored subsequent discussions of hunger and the political systems that create/d it, and it's a big part of the reason we're disposed to evaluate past famines differently these days. Interestingly, the 1981 piece is primarily about another famine that the British had a hand in (the 1943 Bengal famine) due to rice and transport ship confiscations setting off a price panic.  **So let's consider the Irish potato famine :** Again, I have to leave the nitty-gritty details to someone with a better command of this period than I've got, but I can tell you about the commentary that the Irish famine attracts when historians and statisticians are discussing the mechanics of hunger in modern works.  The potato blight has been commonly cited as the reason that the famine happened, and it's entirely true that it played a role. The lack of genetic diversity among the strain of potatoes being grown in Ireland at the time made the island incredibly susceptible to the blight. However, it was a classic example of a \"shock\" that revealed the underlying corruption in the economic system that surrounded it. The blight may have started the famine, but it didn't actually cause it (if that distinction makes any sense).  **So what did cause it?** Britain's Corn Laws were an aggressively protectionist series of tariffs enacted with the intent to keep grain prices high for the benefit of domestic producers. (TL:DR: Landowners didn't want to compete against cheap grain from abroad and also had to pay their farm laborers a living wage, so Parliament levied high taxes on foreign grain and tweaked them as necessary to try to bump domestic grain to what they considered ideal prices.) The Irish poor (of whom there were many, for a variety of very complicated historical and socioeconomic reasons) were largely unable to afford grain as a result of the Corn Laws, and on the generally-small holdings they farmed (for which they paid punitive rents to largely absentee English landlords) could only grow potatoes in sufficient quantity to feed their families.   The potato was thus the staple food, and the blight an utter catastrophe. When potatoes were no longer available, the poor burned through their meager savings quickly to buy grain, and when that ran out, they starved en masse. Parliament repealed the Corn Laws two years into the famine, but it was too little and too late, and also didn't address the other systemic issues (principally landlord exploitation) that contributed to the famine.  So it's pretty apparent why the genocide/famine distinction is a touchy one here:    - **Did the English commit genocide against the Irish?** Not as such.   - **Did they create the circumstances that led to the famine?** Yes, and most historians judge the government's response to the famine as woefully inadequate, to compound the issue."

It is ubiquitous in human history and the immutable lesson is that it can happen to anyone.  Except it doesn't. Certain human societies have been strangely resistant to famine despite weathering the same shocks that caused mass starvation in similar circumstances elsewhere.   Historians and economists had a collective \"Eureka!\" moment in the late 20th century when we realized that famine DOESN'T just happen, and that it probably never has. Hunger can happen despite your best efforts to prevent it, but *famine is the result of politics*.  **Before we go any farther, we need to talk about a guy named Amartya Sen.** He's an Indian economist and historian who's written a lot of really famous and influential pieces about a variety of topics, and he was awarded the 1999 Nobel Prize for his work on welfare economics. In terms of popular reach, he's probably best-known for a 1990 essay on \"More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing,\" which addressed the result of sex-selective abortions in Asia. However, in the academic world he's arguably most famous for his work on famine in human history, and in particular a theory that sounds bananas when you first hear it, and then more and more frighteningly plausible.  I'll break it into two parts:    - **Sen argued that no famine over the last 1,000 years can be attributed to anything other than primarily man-made causes.** This took a while to get traction; we're used to saying that X famine was caused by a flood, or Y famine happened because of a drought, etc. Sen pointed out that natural disasters and crop failures are actually pretty common, but famines aren't usually the result. Left to their own devices, humans are pretty good at finding and storing food as proof against unpredictable shortages. In order to create a famine, you have to have a bad, unstable, and/or corrupt political/economic system that can't weather a sudden shock and is thrown into crisis. We've gotten used to blaming the shock (e.g., the flood, the drought), when in reality it's just a convenient excuse. The real cause is the shitty and inflexible system that existed before it.   - **Sen further argued that no famine has occurred in a democracy with a free press.** The basic idea is that government that isn't accountable to its people is notoriously unresponsive to its needs, and a free press is good at noticing and publicizing problems that government needs to address. There have been some quibbles over this, mostly related to pockets of continuing hunger in India, but for the most part this is a pretty uncontroversial theory.  Sen published his first work on famine in 1981 and has studied the issue on and off since. His work has heavily colored subsequent discussions of hunger and the political systems that create/d it, and it's a big part of the reason we're disposed to evaluate past famines differently these days. Interestingly, the 1981 piece is primarily about another famine that the British had a hand in (the 1943 Bengal famine) due to rice and transport ship confiscations setting off a price panic.  **So let's consider the Irish potato famine :** Again, I have to leave the nitty-gritty details to someone with a better command of this period than I've got, but I can tell you about the commentary that the Irish famine attracts when historians and statisticians are discussing the mechanics of hunger in modern works.  The potato blight has been commonly cited as the reason that the famine happened, and it's entirely true that it played a role. The lack of genetic diversity among the strain of potatoes being grown in Ireland at the time made the island incredibly susceptible to the blight. However, it was a classic example of a \"shock\" that revealed the underlying corruption in the economic system that surrounded it. The blight may have started the famine, but it didn't actually cause it (if that distinction makes any sense).  **So what did cause it?** Britain's Corn Laws were an aggressively protectionist series of tariffs enacted with the intent to keep grain prices high for the benefit of domestic producers. (TL:DR: Landowners didn't want to compete against cheap grain from abroad and also had to pay their farm laborers a living wage, so Parliament levied high taxes on foreign grain and tweaked them as necessary to try to bump domestic grain to what they considered ideal prices.) The Irish poor (of whom there were many, for a variety of very complicated historical and socioeconomic reasons) were largely unable to afford grain as a result of the Corn Laws, and on the generally-small holdings they farmed (for which they paid punitive rents to largely absentee English landlords) could only grow potatoes in sufficient quantity to feed their families.   The potato was thus the staple food, and the blight an utter catastrophe. When potatoes were no longer available, the poor burned through their meager savings quickly to buy grain, and when that ran out, they starved en masse. Parliament repealed the Corn Laws two years into the famine, but it was too little and too late, and also didn't address the other systemic issues (principally landlord exploitation) that contributed to the famine.  So it's pretty apparent why the genocide/famine distinction is a touchy one here:    - **Did the English commit genocide against the Irish?** Not as such.   - **Did they create the circumstances that led to the famine?** Yes, and most historians judge the government's response to the famine as woefully inadequate, to compound the issue.",
        "rejected_target": " According to Cecil Woodham-Smith (in her 1962 book The Great Hunger), the English gave minimal aid mainly due to a rigid ideological belief in free markets. It seems that both political parties, but especially the Whigs who were in power during the worst of it, really believed that the market would provide all that was needful regardless of context, and that any aid would make things worse.   Their evident dislike of the Irish made this an easy belief for them to sustain."

            " Omaha Beach is often described as the most \"famous\" (both well-known among the general public and portrayed in media such as video games, board games, and films) D-Day landing beach as it was the one that was by far the most hard-fought, and the one that came the closest to failure. The resultant popularity of Omaha Beach in media after the fact is due in no small part due to films like *The Longest Day* and the Beach's spectacular (yet fictionalized) depiction in Steven Spielberg's 1998 film *Saving Private Ryan* and subsequent depictions of the scene as missions in video games, some of which bear a striking resemblance to the film. Polls of people in European countries such as this one for France show a trend where public opinion has shifted more in favor of America's role in WWII.  General Omar Bradley, commander of First Army, seriously considered abandoning landings at Omaha Beach midway through the assault (unbeknownst to him, by 0900 small groups of American troops had made it past the bluffs and were attacking German defensive strongpoints from the rear) and re-routing his remaining forces through Utah or one of the British or Canadian beaches;  > I reluctantly contemplated the diversion of Omaha follow-up forces to Utah and the British beaches  Casualties at Omaha Beach were very severe in comparison to the other four landing beaches. Casualties on the beach itself ranged anywhere from 2,000 to 4,700; the exact total may never be known due to imprecise or incomplete record-keeping or the fact that many men, drowned by the weight of their equipment, sank to the bottom of the sea, or simply disappeared after being caught in German artillery bursts, never to be seen again. Joseph Balkoski comes up with a figure of roughly 4,700 for all units that participated in the beach landing or in direct support of it;  **Omaha Beach Casualties**  UNIT|KIA|WIA|MIA|TOTAL :--|:--|:--|:--|:-- **1ST INF DIV**| 16th Inf Regt|86|528|357|971 18th Inf Regt|12|147|45|204 1st Engr C Bn|4|27|6|37 1st MP Plt|1|22||23 7th FA Bn|4|14|3|21 1st Inf Div HQ Co||2||2 32nd FA Bn||||28^a 1st Med Bn||||c. 40^b 26th Inf Regt||||c. 20^b **TOTAL 1ST INF DIV**||||**1,346^b** **29TH INF DIV**|KIA|WIA|MIA|TOTAL 116th Inf Regt|247|576|184|1,007 115th Inf Regt|33|68|2|103 121st Engr C Bn|18|31|31|80 111th FA Bn|17|26|4|47 104th Med Bn|2|8|10|20 29th Inf Div HQ Co||1||1 175th Inf Regt|1|||1 29th Rcn Trp (Mec'z.)|3|||3 29th MP Plt||||c. 10^b **TOTAL 29TH INF DIV**||||**1,272** **V CORPS/FIRST ARMY UNITS**|KIA|WIA|MIA|TOTAL 2nd and 5th Rgr Bns|96|183|32|311^c 146th Engr C Bn|84|112||196 299th Engr C Bn|71|c. 75||c. 146^d 112th Engr C Bn|8|30||38 20th Engr C Bn|3|10||13 37th Engr C Bn||||82^a 336th Engr C Bn||||30^a 348th Engr C Bn||||21^a 149th Engr C Bn||||c. 50^a 147th Engr C Bn||||c. 45^a 397th AA Bn|17|71|32|120 467th AA Bn|8|31||39 197th AA Bn|5|12||17 81st Chem Mort Bn|10|20||30 741st Tk Bn|c. 45|c. 60||c. 105^b 743rd Tk Bn||||c. 70^b 745th Tk Bn|1|||1 61st Sig Bn|1|3||4^e 5th and 6th Engr Spc Brigs||||c. 250^f **TOTAL V CORPS/FIRST ARMY**||||**1,568** **U.S. NAVY/COAST GUARD AND ROYAL NAVY**|KIA|WIA|MIA|TOTAL Naval C Dem Units|24|32|15|71 6th NBB|22|77||99 7th NBB|19|10||29 USN/USCG Landing Craft Crews||||c. 280^b RN Landing Craft Crews||||c. 30^b Naval Shore Fire Control Parties||||c. 15^b **TOTAL NAVY/COAST GUARD**||||**539** **EIGHTH AF**|KIA|WIA|MIA|TOTAL 2nd Bomb Division|10|||10 **TOTAL EIGHTH AF**|10|||**10** **GRAND TOTAL OMAHA BEACH**||||**4,720**  a: Indicated figure is casualty total only.

U.S. Navy units attached to Engineer Special Brigades are not included in this total.  Another reason that Omaha Beach is particularly well-known is because of the 2nd Ranger Battalion's daring mission to scale the sheer cliffs at Pointe du Hoc using grapnel hooks and rope ladders and destroy German artillery pieces located there, and then defend against German counterattacks until relieved. The Rangers suffered heavy losses during the initial assault and subsequent defense, but succeeded in their mission. The armor (especially the DD tanks) launched at Omaha Beach generally also fared very poorly in comparison to the other beaches, being launched too far out and getting caught in the swift current;  Division|DD Tank Unit|Beach|Tanks embarked|Tanks launched into sea|Tanks discharged directly onto beach|Tanks sunk after launch or not landed|Notes :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:-- 3rd Br Inf Div|13th/18th Royal Hussars (Queen Mary's Own)|Sword|38|32|5|**4**|3 tanks sunk after launch, 1 not launched 3rd Cdn Inf Div|6th Cdn Armoured Regt (1st Cdn Hussars)|Juno|40|30|10|**5**|10 tanks were deposited directly on the beach after their LCTs were damaged 3rd Cdn Inf Div|10th Cdn Armoured Regt (Fort Garry Horse)|Juno|40|20|20|**0**|20 sea-launched and 20 deposited directly on beach 50th Br Inf Div|4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards|Gold|40|0|40|**0**|Deposited directly on beach 50th Br Inf Div|Nottinghamshire Yeomanry (Sherwood Rangers)|Gold|40|40||**0**|All swam in successfully 1st US Inf Div|741st Tk Bn|Omaha|32|29|3|**27**|3 tanks were deposited directly on the beach after their LCT was damaged; 27 of the 29 sea-launched tanks sunk 29th US Inf Div|743rd Tk Bn|Omaha|32||32|**0**|Deposited directly on beach 4th US Inf Div|70th Tk Bn|Utah|32|28||**5**|1 tank sunk after launch, 4 lost when LCT hit and was sunk  In contrast, Juno Beach inflicted around 1,000 casualties on the attacking 3rd Canadian Infantry Division (340 dead, 574 wounded, 47 captured in the Division only) Gold Beach caused around 1,000 casualties to *all* British units attacking the beach.

Just recently I finished watching \u201cThe Good Place\u201d and after hearing all of the philosophy themes within the show I\u2019m really excited to learn more. I took a handful of philosophy classes in college and loved them. Only problem is I have the attention span of a goldfish and haven\u2019t read for fun since I was a kid.  I\u2019m not too proud to admit that I have trouble concentrating on a book with dense writing and, for all I loved about those philosophy classes, I found the lectures to be the best part as the reading was just a bit confusing for me. Additionally, I personally prefer content speaks to me on an informal level, using colloquialisms to convey complex concepts.  TL:DR: Are there any great books about philosophy out there that aren\u2019t too difficult to read/informal in their delivery? I personally prefer modern philosophy or anything surrounding existentialism, epistemology, morality and ethics.  Thanks!\n\nAssistant:": {

They're not quite to the point where it's cheaper to manufacture everything in the Earth Kingdom and ship it around the world. - It's the traditional style of their homelands. Not everyone is super patriotic, but most people would at least have some kind of fondness and connection to the culture of the place they (or their ancestors) came from. Sure, Varrick *could* get some fine red clothes from the Fire Nation (they make the best red stuff there), but he *likes* Water Tribe blue. - People in Avatar-world tend to have eye colors that match their ancestry and/or bending type. Mako has reddish eyes, Bolin has green eyes, Korra has blue eyes, and Tenzin has gray eyes. This isn't absolute - Asami actually has greenish eyes despite having Fire Nation ancestory - but it's common enough to reinforce the trends. Fashion-conscious people would gravitate towards color palettes that complement their eye colors.  These things'll probably fade over time, but for now it's only been 70 years since the end of the Hundred Years War. The world hasn't been connected that long.",

    "\n\nHuman: [MCU] Who legally owns/has the best claim to Captain Americas sheild? Rewatching Falcon and the Winter Solider and they mention the shield is a legal gray area and it made me wonder who would have the best claim.   Howard Stark and Stark Industries made it but I imagine they were commissioned to by American military so it started out as their property. Cap uses it during WW2 and continues to when he comes out of the ice but I don't think soliders own the weapons and equipment they use during service and until Sheild collapses Cap is still working for the government. He continues to use the shield until Civil War with the government's permission so do they lose rights to ownership by letting him use it for so long without contesting it? After Civil War Tony takes possession of it and keeps it for around 8 years. It's now in Sam's possession so is it his?  So in summary does Stark Industries have the biggest claim since they built it and Tony had it in his possession for close to a decade? Does Sam own it because he currently has it? Do the US government have a claim since they likely paid for its construction? Do the Wakandans have a claim since its likely made out of stolen Vibranium? To further complicate things the original sheild was destroyed so are there two separate owners? One for the old shield and one for the new.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Let's start with the very basics.  1. *Where do business cycles come from?*    * Keynesians think that business cycles are the result of swings in investor and consumer confidence, manifested in financial / stock market booms and busts. When investor confidence falters, for whatever reason, the economy plunges into recession.     * Austrians think that erratic Federal Reserve interest rate policy causes recessions. The Fed will reduce interest rates to spark a boom, but this leads investors to over-commit capital  to risky projects in their chase for yield. Austrians call this phenomenon \"malinvestment.\" These malinvestments then go bad, leading to recession. The boom contains the seeds of its own destruction.  2. *What should we do about it?*     * Keynesians think that active government policy can manage aggregate demand. In the simplest story, when investor confidence falters, the government can step in and fill the demand gap. When investor spirits are high, the government cuts back. This leads to stability in overall expenditure, thus smoothing out the business cycle.     * Austrians think we need tight restrictions on the Federal Reserve, because it's the Fed's fault to begin with for trying to engineer a boom. Thus we need to put restrictions in place, such as some kind of commodity standard to \"tie the Fed's hands\" and make sure it can't do anything too awful to the economy.     * Austrians also believe that countercyclical policy is wrongheaded: if the government steps in to prop up demand, then those malinvestments won't be liquidated, and one just prolongs the imbalance. If the Fed does screw up and plunge us into recession, the best course of action is to let the recession ride out and clear up any malinvestment. Engaging in countercyclical policy just prolongs the bleeding.  There's an intro. Let me know if you want more information. Neither of these schools of thought is right, in my estimation. :)",
            " The Keynesian school believes in something called \"active, counter-cyclical stabilization policy.\" Basically this means that when the economy is doing poorly, the government should take steps to improve the economy. Likewise, when the economy is growing too quickly, the government should take steps to slow it down.  Steps that the government takes include raising or lowering taxes, or raising or lowering government spending.  The reason government do this is because the main economic indicator of a country is its Gross Domestic Product, or GDP. GDP is made up of four components:  * C - Consumer spending * I - Investment * G - Government spending * (X - M) - Net exports (exports minus imports)  You can write this algebraically as GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)  When taxes are raised or lowered, consumer spending decreases or increases ('C' goes down or up) respectively. When government spending is raised or lowered, 'G' goes up or down, respectively. That's the basis of the Keynesian school of thought (in terms of fiscal policy; monetary policy is an entirely different demon to tackle).  Austrians, on the other hand, believe that economies are largely subject to causes and effects that are outside the control of those in the economy. In other words, the Austrian school maintains that the economy will self-correct. Moreover, any interference in the free market only serves to hinder it further."

Our nearly 5 year old, 109 lb, male pitbull has cancer.  It's bad.  Long story short, the only remedy is euthanasia.  According to the vet, surgery is off the table (he's too far gone), as is chemo (unlikely to yield a good result while only making him sick).  His name is Zeus and he is the sweetest, gentlest, lovable guy you will ever meet. Our family is devistated.  Here are the x-rays for anyone interested. There are 7 images in the gallery. https://imgur.com/gallery/HRfJodc  We have to make a decision soon, before he begins to suffer unnecessarily. Prolonging his life, at this point, is only because we don't want to let him go.  His \"brother\" is a 3 year old pitbull mix.  They are EXTREMELY close.  Do we arrange to have the other dog present while we have the sick guy euthanized?  I don't want him to not know where his brother went.... but maybe this is a bad idea.  I don't know and am desperately seeking advice.  Also, we can arrange a service to perform the euthanization here at home or we can take him to the vet where he absolutely loves to visit.

For example do you have the option to bury him on your property or is cremation something you might consider? It seems like you have a good relationship with your current vet, if I were in your situation then I'd check what their protocols are as far as allowing people into the clinic and strongly consider making a booking with them, as both you and Zeus know them.

            " Any tax over 50% is absolutely absurd and almost nobody has ever paid 94% tax on anything, whenever something that insane is introduced more loopholes get put into the law out of sheer necessity because the system can't function like that.   In addition to that the vast majority of government money is just shat away with zero accountability, so you're basically just stealing money from people to shit it away while making the laws themselves more corrupt and if you do actually get 94% effective tax rate everyone will just leave and then you have a real problem on your hands.",

            " You are conflating the top tax bracket rate with the effective tax rate.  Despite any of the historic tax increases under Obama/Clinton/GHW Bush and tax cuts under Reagan, Kennedy, GW Bush, the average effective tax rate runs about 15-18%.   When Presidents have \"cut\" taxes by lowering the tax rates, they also eliminate a lot of deductions so the actual money collected as a percentage of income remains roughly the same.  And when Presidents increase tax rates, they insert a lot of new tax breaks so again the actual money collected as a percentage of income remains roughly the same.  Here's an example.  Before the Reagan tax cut people could write off their credit card interest and the price of a cruise could be expensed if there was a short business in-service was conducted.  Those were eliminated.  When the Trump era tax cuts happened a lot of home business expenses were eliminated.  IMHO, the best way to raise taxes on the rich is to leave rates alone but cap a lot of deductions and tax unearned income like dividends and capital gains at the same rate as earned income.",

            " Problem is that billionaires don't get to be billionaires with saleries. Their CEO wages are pretty reasonable and for example Bill Gates salary was $0 in their last decade as CEO at Microsoft.  And it's also not just salary income. These people don't earn or deposit their wealth on bank accounts. Their wealth is tied in assets like stocks. And when stocks rise in value these people get richer and pay zero tax on that zero income. Rise in valuation is not taxable income.  When they need money they will loan from a bank and put those billions of stock assets as colleteral. Now they are paying loan interest that is tax deductible and withdraw just enough money from other assets to pay for these loans. Meaning they get richer while having zero taxable income.",

But sure, let's assume you are correct. Let's do a quick test run on this with someone who would become the next billionaire. So let's say we have Beff Jezos and he starts up a tech company. He needs to seek funding in order to grow and he sells of 25% of his company for 10 million dollars, this makes his company worth 40 million, of which he owns 75%. Uhoh, Beff has just observed a 30 million dollar jump in net worth, where is he going to come up with his 26 million dollar tax liability? He doesn't have that cash. The company has barely even gotten started and the owner is worse off than he was before he sought investment.   If we instead observe the income when the asset is sold... and have a capital gain tax on that income we might have gotten literal billions over time while potentially employing thousands of other tax paying people.",

The people preventing that are our career politicians, who have net worths of millions upon millions in the name of \u201cpublic servitude.\u201d These are people you have voted in just as much as I have. Why aren\u2019t we attacking them instead of regular people?  Socialism is still not economically sound as it reduces the amount of diversity in financial portfolios and centralizes processes that can have drastic effects if it crumbles. In my opinion, your idea would have been better if the math was realistic, didn\u2019t attack a demographic for wanting more control over their finances, took into consideration that corporations are only out to benefit shareholders (aka the people), and considered that people contributed to the wealth of billionaires who provided a value product/service.

The other thing is you're going after the wrong type of personal gain. You sort of allude to this but I'm not sure. The people who are running away with the bank don't make income.   All of the 0.0001%'s cash comes in the form of realized capital gains and low interest loans that are quickly repaid as they acquire assets. Raising income taxes will not hit realized capital gains.

            " Problem is that billionaires don't get to be billionaires with saleries. Their CEO wages are pretty reasonable and for example Bill Gates salary was $0 in their last decade as CEO at Microsoft.  And it's also not just salary income. These people don't earn or deposit their wealth on bank accounts. Their wealth is tied in assets like stocks. And when stocks rise in value these people get richer and pay zero tax on that zero income. Rise in valuation is not taxable income.  When they need money they will loan from a bank and put those billions of stock assets as colleteral. Now they are paying loan interest that is tax deductible and withdraw just enough money from other assets to pay for these loans. Meaning they get richer while having zero taxable income.",

I agree that the rate may need to be higher but 94% would just tip the scales from billionaire private citizens to billionaire politicians.

He needs to seek funding in order to grow and he sells of 25% of his company for 10 million dollars, this makes his company worth 40 million, of which he owns 75%. Uhoh, Beff has just observed a 30 million dollar jump in net worth, where is he going to come up with his 26 million dollar tax liability? He doesn't have that cash. The company has barely even gotten started and the owner is worse off than he was before he sought investment.   If we instead observe the income when the asset is sold... and have a capital gain tax on that income we might have gotten literal billions over time while potentially employing thousands of other tax paying people.",

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: If a leader is democratically elected, the people are absolutely to blame for the bad things he or she does either domestically or abroad People always talk about how people are different from politicians, and you are not supposed to judge a person based on what their politicians do. However I would argue that this is simply a tactic used to avoid responsibility. I do not want to point fingers at specific countries in my actual post, even though I will probably do so in the comments anyway, so my apologies if the names of these fake countries sound cheesy to you, but anyway, here we go anyway. Imagine the following hypothetical scenario:  The people of Awesomeland elect President X, who wins by a landslide. Then, President X makes some very unpopular choices domestically, and many people say:  \u201cIt is what it is, it\u2019s not up to us.\u201d   Yes it is, you specifically gave him power.  But OK, to make up for his shitty domestic choices, President X now invades Evilstan. A lot of Evilstanjans are killed by airstrikes and Awesomeland soldiers. Their economy is crippled by sanctions.  Yet the people of Awesomeland will argue, that the average Awesomelandian should not be blamed, because they\u2019re just people.   In reality, no. Every single Awesomelandian who voted for President X now has blood on his hands.  Again, not directly naming any countries, so as to not get shit in the comments.\n\nAssistant:": {

Who is allowed to run as a candidate, who receives the media/news attention, and who has the money to advertise all matter. A lot.  Political science has studied voter behavior for decades along with psychologists. We know that there are a lot of things that influence people, whether they know it or not.

I don't have issues with chroma-subsampling and the pixel density is similar to my previous LG 34GN850 widescreen monitor. The big difference is the connectivity as it has 4 HDMI 2.1 ports but not a single display port let alone VGA/DVI. The screen is also not curved so the upper corners seems very far from me so I use the free Microsoft Fancy Zones utility to layout 4-5 windows across the screen in a productive / accessible way."

    "\n\nHuman: Kid put his stuff in my yard; ran over it with my lawn mower; mom wants me to pay. So my yard goes pretty close to the neighbor\u2019s concrete pad where they have a basketball court set up. Neighborhood kids always go there to play and usually leave their bikes and things on my grass. It\u2019s not that big of a deal except I have had to ask them to move there stuff several times when I\u2019m mowing.   This is the first time I\u2019ve mowed this year and the grass is a few inches higher than it should be. Anyway, a kid comes over and I\u2019m mowing but he still puts the basketball he brought with him down in my grass.  I get to the basketball and just decide I can nudge it with the front of the mower and out of the way. I made eye contact with the kid several times waiting for him to move it before I got there and he never did so I figured \u201cwhatever, it\u2019ll roll.\u201d  Well I bump it with my mower over to a section of mower grass and as I continue forward past where it was there was a loud clunking and crackling like I\u2019d just run over a rock. The rock turned out to be his iPhone.   He was upset obviously that his phone was broken and I did feel bad but my thought was that he should\u2019ve said something or moved it before I got there.  He goes home and about thirty minutes later his mom shows up and tells me I broke it and am responsible for replacing it, that I should have told him to move his stuff because I am the adult.  I tell her I\u2019m sorry about the phone and politely decline her request. She just says \u201cI promise you WILL be paying for it.\u201d And then storms off. I\u2019m not really sure what her next course of action is or what she plans to do. She mentioned something about she has a friend that\u2019s a lawyer, so I guess she could take me to civil court?  Am I legally responsible for replacing the phone? Would it be cheaper than court costs if she did choose to take me to court?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: My neighbor trespassed and stole two plants while I was out of town Like the title says, my across-the-street neighbor walked onto my property when I wasn\u2019t home and stole plants sitting next to my house on the side of my driveway. I have her on camera walking onto my property multiple times and ultimately picking up and taking two large potted plants.  I am in the state of Washington, and my understanding is that this is, at a minimum, criminal trespassing (RCW 9A.52.080) but she also stole things which I can\u2019t find an applicable law for since all the burglary laws (RCW 9A.52.020 - RCW 9A.52.030) seem to apply to entering a dwelling.  I don\u2019t believe any of the defenses to criminal trespassing (RCW 9A.52.090) could apply since I\u2019ve only spoken to her one time when I moved in a few months ago and have never given her permission to walk onto my property.   The plants were near my trash cans but not out near the street or anything indicating that they were free for taking, and the plants have been there for months, since that\u2019s where I keep them. So it seems she could try to claim the defense:   *\u201c(3) The actor reasonably believed that the owner of the premises, or other person empowered to license access thereto, would have licensed him or her to enter or remain;\u201d*  but there was no indication that the plants were up for the taking. I also have a photo of me watering the plants showing they are my and are on my property.  So what are my options? Confront them and if they lie then tell them I have a video? Go straight to the police with the evidence? I know they are \u201cjust plants\u201d, but they are mine, they are important to me, and I feel very violated by her taking them.\n\nAssistant:": {
