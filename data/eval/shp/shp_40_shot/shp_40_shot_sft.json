I know they say that you should absorb all that information and I'm sure in an ideal world it could happen, but realistically you're going to have to cut out a lot of memorization and just get the abstract written. This is what I did.  First, I bought the biggest binder I could find that had the see-through pockets on the front. Sounds like you will need two of these.  Then I went to the school's library and printed off every article I needed including the weekly reading schedule. I stapled these and used a three-holed punch and put them in the binder in order. I then put the weekly schedule in the see-through part of the binder.  Next I got a dedicated notebook and wrote my schedule for all of my classes including assignment due dates. It went with me everywhere. I even wrote out a weekly schedule where I blocked out time slots for each class to get assignments done and I stuck to it religiously.  I highly recommend doing this. It will take you about a day, but the time is well worth the effort.  When it was time to work on assignments, I would pull the article I needed. I had three highlighters. Pink for things I knew I had to remember. Green for pertinent information. Yellow for new ideas or general information I thought might be helpful for inclass discussion. I would use a pen to block out passages of text and highlight them accordingly. I never underlined, I found blocking around the text allowed for readability. Sometimes I would annotate my thought in the margins which aided me in inclass discussions.  After I finished that, I would write my abstract going back through the article using everything I had blocked out. It really helps you to develope a knack for summarizing. I would save these and use them to study for tests.  I ended up getting A's in both of these classes. I was tired and stressed, between work and school I averaged about four hours of sleep a night. My GPA stood at 3.8 so it was definitely worth the sacrifice. Manage your time wisely and remember you can sleep when you're all done with that nice degree hanging on your wall."

I am a graduating Ph.D. who is a little undecided about his future in academia. One possibility that especially interests me is a faculty position at a teaching-oriented institution. I have many questions about what that job looks like and what I should do to get there, and I appreciate those of you who will take the time to give your insight. But before jumping to the questions, let me give some context:  **CV**: I will be graduating at the end of this academic year with a Ph.D. in computer science from a large state school. My focus is in machine learning, which is a very hot area at the moment, and should be for the foreseeable future. I have a short but high-quality list of publications which include a best student paper award at a smaller conference as well as an oral presentation at what is arguably the top venue in my field. I am supported by my university's highest graduate fellowship, and I have two letters from well-regarded professors from other universities external to my own. I don't have a great idea of exactly how competitive my CV is or what sort of interviews it will get me, but my advisors seem to think that I should be applying to postdoc positions at top institutes.  **Interests**: I'd say that I have a love/hate relationship with research. I enjoy the outcome of a project: writing up my work, presenting it, polishing it relentlessly. But I don't especially enjoy the bulk of the research process. If I am being honest with myself about my abilities, I do not believe that I am as technically proficient as others in my area, which means that progress comes slower and with more of a struggle. I'm still confident that I can produce good research! But the process as a whole isn't particularly enjoyable.  I don't know that I would want to leave research completely behind, but I am certain that I do not want a career *focused* on research. On the other hand, I am quite interested in teaching. One of the things I really enjoy about being a researcher is talking about complicated ideas and trying to convey them clearly and simply. Isn't this a huge component of teaching?! I was a lecturer for an entry-level course early in my graduate career, and it is a process that I found enjoyable enough. So the signs are pointing me in the direction of an academic career at a teaching-oriented institution.  **Questions**: All of my experience with academia has been at large research universities. As such, I have many questions about what an academic career looks like at a school with a teaching mission and about how to get there from where I am now.  In all of the following questions I understand that there may be different answers for *private* colleges and *public* institutions. I am very interested in understanding that divide. Also keep in mind that my area -- machine learning -- is in something of a boom right now. Does that affect, e.g., the likelihood of finding a good position?  1. Teaching professors are being replaced by adjuncts. Is it even wise for me to try and find a tenure-track position at a teaching college at this point in time?  2. What sort of opportunity will I have to do (or not do) research at a teaching school? If I never publish again, is that seen as a bad thing? If I want to trickle out a paper every couple of years, is that doable?  3. How bad is the pay? I am coming up on 30 without any savings for retirement, so this isn't just a superficial concern; though don't get me wrong, I'd like to be able to afford some international travel. I understand that there is a gap between private and public here. Is this true, in your experience?  4. What opportunity does a faculty member at a teaching school have for \"extra-curriculars\", e.g., running a startup or consulting? It isn't uncommon for computer science faculty at research institutions to have a startup; is this different at private schools or places with a teaching focus?  5. Is doing a research postdoc in my best interest if I want to look for a job at a teaching school?  6. I have heard that a publication or two in a pedagogical journal or conference is a must for finding a good position. How severe is this need, and should I start working towards that immediately?  7. I can understand the gap between a top research university and a second-tier school, and so if I were going into a research career I'd obviously want to shoot for a top place. Is the idea the same for a teaching school? Are the students at a top place that much better than at a second-tier school?  This was a lot to read, and I appreciate you taking the time to go through it. If you have any input for some of the questions, or even an answer to a question I didn't ask but should have, it's very welcome. Thank you!\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " I'm a recently tenured professor in the math department of a fairly selective SLAC, and I've been involved in several different hiring processes at our institution.  Here are my answers to your questions:  > Teaching professors are being replaced by adjuncts. Is it even wise for me to try and find a tenure-track position at a teaching college at this point in time?  In general, highly-ranked liberal arts colleges try to avoid hiring more than a small number of adjuncts.  This is much more of an issue at large state universities.  Students come to small liberal arts colleges because they want to interact closely with actual faculty members, so hiring adjuncts undercuts the prestige and appeal of the institution.  > What sort of opportunity will I have to do (or not do) research at a teaching school? If I never publish again, is that seen as a bad thing? If I want to trickle out a paper every couple of years, is that doable?  Research is a significant component of the requirements for tenure at most SLAC's.  Of course, research expectations are not as high as they would be at an R1 university, because the college recognizes that you spend more time on teaching than you would at a university.  If I had to put a number on it, I would say that the expected rate of publication at my institution is roughly half of what it would be at a university.  So if you never publish again, you would absolutely be unable to get tenure at most SLAC's.  Trickling out a paper every couple of years is also probably not enough, though of course the rate of publication for researchers tends to depend a lot on field and even subfield of specialization.  > How bad is the pay? I am coming up on 30 without any savings for retirement, so this isn't just a superficial concern; though don't get me wrong, I'd like to be able to afford some international travel. I understand that there is a gap between private and public here. Is this true, in your experience?  I don't have a good sense of this, but you ought to be able to find specific data about it on the internet.  Make sure to factor in cost of living adjustments when comparing pay at different institutions.  > What opportunity does a faculty member at a teaching school have for \"extra-curriculars\", e.g., running a startup or consulting? It isn't uncommon for computer science faculty at research institutions to have a startup; is this different at private schools or places with a teaching focus?  This seems very computer-science specific, so I can't really answer it.  I don't think any of the computer science faculty at my institution have a startup, but this may be related to their research areas as opposed to any institutional policies or culture.  > Is doing a research postdoc in my best interest if I want to look for a job at a teaching school?  Absolutely.  In my field, at least (mathematics), I would say that we pretty much expect most tenure-track applicants to be coming off of a research postdoc.  Doing research at a small institution can be difficult, so we are really looking for people who already have an established research program, which is much less common for those coming directly from a Ph.D. program.  It's also possible to go from a Ph.D. program to a visiting position at a SLAC, followed by a tenure-track job, but it can be more difficult to build your research program during a teaching position than during a research postdoc.  We have also occasionally hired tenure-track STEM faculty directly from Ph.D. programs, but I would describe these as exceptional candidates with clear research momentum.  > I have heard that a publication or two in a pedagogical journal or conference is a must for finding a good position. How severe is this need, and should I start working towards that immediately?  At least at my institution, I wouldn't say that publications in pedagogical journals are particularly common or carry very much weight.  What is required is some evidence of enthusiasm for teaching, such as a teaching award while in grad school, participation in teaching-oriented outreach activities, experience with curricular design, a history of innovative teaching, and so forth.  Publication in a pedagogical journal would probably count in this regard, but it is by no means expected or even particularly common.  I also have the sense that my institution would not count publications in pedagogical journals as being particularly relevant for tenure, but I suspect that this varies from place to place.  > I can understand the gap between a top research university and a second-tier school, and so if I were going into a research career I'd obviously want to shoot for a top place. Is the idea the same for a teaching school? Are the students at a top place that much better than at a second-tier school?  Yes, absolutely.  You can get some sense of this by looking at the demographic data (e.g. acceptance rate or median incoming SAT scores) for various institutions.  Top liberal arts colleges will have a greater share of talented students, particularly students who are heading for Ph.D. programs themselves."

Finished my PhD with a solid amount of top tier publications in my field (STEM), post-doc at a high ranking university for a year, and now I\u2019m on my second post-doc at a higher ranked university.  &#x200B;  In my post-docs, though, things just slowed down, and I haven\u2019t been able to publish anything. There are a number of reasons for this. I was spread thin on different projects and never found time to finish anything. I was less motivated to output without my thesis looming ahead. I had an absent post-doc advisor. I\u2019ve been just doing the things that need to get done. Things that I used to really like doing I find very dull and dread doing now, which is why I'm writing this post and not something else.  &#x200B;  Next thing I know, it\u2019s almost 2 years later and I have little to show for it; I\u2019ve barely even submitted a paper. I\u2019ve been told by a few people that this part of academia just sucks, but I think it sucks enough that I really don\u2019t want to keep doing something I don\u2019t like, especially because I\u2019m afraid that TT won\u2019t be any better. On top of all that, I\u2019m afraid my 2 years without publishing can\u2019t be made up for with my PhD publications and anything I do next. The thing is, outside of work things are going super well - which I know is a problem for a lot of post-docs. But I love the city I moved to, have supportive partner, made lots of great friends, have a great social life, picked up new hobbies.... It's just my job that's really draining me.  &#x200B;  So now to the real problem I want to ask about (although I'll take advice on the rest). I\u2019ve always been working for a faculty position, and I don\u2019t know what to do without that. People who\u2019ve left academia, what do you do know? When did you realize that you wanted to leave and how did you go about finding something else? Are things better?  &#x200B;  tldr: always been on track for faculty position; now I wanna jump ship, but I have no idea where to land.\n\nAssistant:"

At least for a bit longer before you do anything drastic.  It sounds like pretty much everything in your life is going great, *especially* career-wise, and all you are dealing with is a lack of motivation, confidence, and perhaps some slightly depressive symptoms (which likely aren't that bad if your life outside of work is happy). Having a slight slump in your publication output if your track record is extremely good is basically irrelevant, as long as you get back on track at some point, which you almost certainly have the ability to do if you've made it this far and if you put your mind to it. What seems to be more the issue is your confidence and your grit to overcome this (possibly minor) problem.   In terms of confidence and motivation, basically every single person in STEM goes through this (maybe everyone in academia). You may need to specifically allocate time to just doing \"fun\" things (I don't mean outside of research, I mean related to your field, but perhaps not necessarily your active research). Maybe you need to read that interesting textbook  you never got around to, or do some fun side coding projects, or try some outlandish ideas, or find cutting edge conference talks to watch on youtube, or... It's hard for me to suggest without knowing your exact field, but the point is you want to spend some time being excited, even if it's not exactly on what you're currently working on. And sometimes this is where great progress comes from.   The point is this is an active decision you need to make: \"I am feeling demotivated so I am going to spend some amount of time on things that excite me.\" Also, don't fall into the trap of saying you are too busy for this. That's nonsense - you've already told us that your output is lower from being demotivated, so improving your motivation will increase your output. You've also told us your life outside of work is full of hobbies and social time, so you are not too busy.  Next, please recognize that academia is a cushy job. Yes, it's full of things that you don't want to do, but so are all jobs. That's literally what jobs are most of the time. Industry jobs are also full of things you don't want to do. I'm not saying it's impossible that you could be happier in industry, I'm just saying that the fact that you want to leave without even knowing what you're leaving *to* sounds too naive for the level of certainty you're showing in this post.  Lastly, it just generally seems irrational to me to put in place a 10-15 year plan, succeed at it greatly, then jump ship right before the finish line due to some (possibly minor) difficulty. This is especially true given that most of the time it's easy to go from academia to industry, but the reverse is much harder. Stick it out a few more years - if you truly have put all possible effort into making things work and find that you still want to leave, then industry will still be waiting for you. If you leave now and realize it's a mistake, that is going to be much worse. You probably have \\~50-60 years of life left ahead of you - don't make the typical late 20's early 30's mistake of imagining this next few years is *so* important that you can't spend it doing something you don't like for the sake of avoiding decades of regret."

But I'm honestly curious - what would you do in this situation? At what point, if things don't improve, do you tell the PI that it's not worth it to have an undergraduate in the lab?  I'm a postdoc in chemistry/chemical biology at an R1 University. I currently have two undergraduates working under me, one of whom joined the lab ~8 months ago (Undergrad A), and another who is shared between our lab and a collaborator at the University and started ~5 months ago (Undergrad B). Both are pare of a prestigious, specialized program in biochemical sciences and are clearly very bright students, at least in the classroom. Undergraduate A was actually a student in a course I taught this past semester, and earned by far the top grade in the class (no, I did not help him outside of class time in a way I would not have for any other student).  Undergraduate B, since starting working in our lab, has been a very good researcher. Sure, he's made mistakes but (1) nothing that can't easily be remedied or repeated rapidly and (2) clearly wants to learn, and asks the type of challenging questions that push me to learn more as well.  Undergraduate A, on the other hand, has had some issues. When he started in the lab, things went smoothly - sure, I was practically holding his hand, but that's par for the course until they have experience with common techniques/procedures we use every day. Then, during the middle of the semester, he simply stopped showing up (with several things in progress that I then had to take care of). Understandable, considering that he apparently took something like eight classes this past semester - but I was given no notice or warning, and basically no communication for almost two months.  The semester ends, and he comes back to the lab - great! Except within the first two weeks, it was apparent that he'd pretty much forgotten everything he'd learned previously. I had to do the hand-holding all over again. Some old issues I'd attributed to him being busy with classes - like asking him when to sign up for a particular instrument (e.g. \"When can you do X? Okay, great, I'll sign up for time) and then not showing up (him: \"Oops, I forgot/I had class then\"). Messes were left behind, reagents left out, room-temperature sensitive proteins left on the benchtop overnight...  So about a month ago, I sat him down to have a chat about being more conscientious in the lab, making sure he's here to do X when he says he will, keeping good records, etc. He said he'd get better, dropped a lab class (I did not ask him to do this) that was taking up a lot of his time, and we resumed research.  Since then, the same issues have continued. I have been extremely busy - who isn't? - so I've maybe been a little short with him at times. However, he doesn't ask what he should be doing, when, or how; when I ask him what he's doing, he tells me very little (e.g. him: \"I started X.\" me: \"Okay, how far along is it? Where is it? When will it be finished?\" him: \"It's going; it's in the freezer. I'll let you know.\"). When I tell him that we should plan on doing experiment Y this week, and he should have X going on in the background but it is not a priority, there seems to be a total disconnect - he does X, completely ignores Y, and no tangible progress is being made. We finally got good proof-of-principle data for the project I've got him working on a couple of weeks ago; I wanted to repeat it more carefully this week. Instead, he spent the week practically avoiding me, and re-expressing every protein we've ever used (even though we do not need more of anything at this point). Reagents are still left out; messes are still being made and not cleaned up; common lab responsibilities are ignored.  Perhaps the last straw was last night. He'd left for the day, apparently, and asked me to take care of something that was in progress - via e-mail, around 8 PM (I normally would not have still been in the lab; I work early hours, rather than late into the night). Luckily I was still in the lab due to a long experiment (that was frustratingly botched by an equipment failure), and took care of it. I e-mailed him and told him I took care of it, but not to come in over the weekend. I am/will take care of things he has in progress; I just don't have the patience for dealing with more right now.  Then, this morning, I sent him what I consider to be a warning e-mail. As politely as I could, I brought up the issues and told him he needed to improve. I'm expecting the PI to come in soon, and plan to tell him a little about it just so that - if problems continue - it doesn't come out of nowhere to him.  At this point, I honestly think I give him another month to shape up, or I talk to the PI and tell him I'll do the project myself. What do you, fellow academics, think? Ever had to deal with a flaky and irresponsible undergrad?\n\nAssistant:"

International journals have standards for authorship, and by those, your boss should not be first author.  Collecting data (through his clinic), providing manuscript revisions, and presumably providing funding are things that would make him a legitimate co-author, but typically in biomedical papers, this would be as the last author called the senior author.    That being said, he sounds like an ass and I have no idea what types of job protections you have.  People saying you just need to explain to him the rules of a journal have no idea.  He knows what the rules are, he does not care.  If your medical center has a research ethics/integrity office, this is where you would file a complaint, but if you are dependent on this person for a job, it will end bad for you unless you have protection from some type of union or tenure.

I am normally a calmn person but I am finding myself angry at a student for a nonsensical reason.     I am teaching a CS course. In this course we provided undergrads with a template in Javascript so that they could do a demo. The assignment uses a sophisticated data structure that is common in geometry processing that we provided students so that they can do their assignment.     Using the DS is not complicated but it takes a lot of effort and care to make it work properly which is why we give it to them instead of asking them to code it.     One student came during office hours to ask for help, and I am more than happy to help them out. I went over multiple examples on paper on how the algorithm they need to implement works. I suggested multiple different possible implementations to see if one would click. I asked the student to walk me over a few steps of what they should do, to try to gauge what they were confused about.     This student is a PhD candidate taking an upper year undergrad course as part of their degree, take this into consideration for what I am about to describe, this is not a first year undergrad but someone who already graduated and is at the PhD level (albeit in a different discipline to mine).     After an hour of trying to help the student understand the assignment they said two things in that conversation that struck a cord in me (politely, the student was never rude in any way).      1) Can I get extra marks for making a writeup of what I understand about the assignment?     Which absolutely not, the course is about application and being able to code the algorithm, failing to implement the algorithm (which many other students have implemented) is a failure in the assignment, period, why would you be entitled to marks for a writeup when there is no written component to the assignment?     2) They mentioned that they were struggling for time and they thought they might not finish the assignment (not asking for an extension, they just mentioned it as part of the conversation and did not dwell on it, they did not ask for any additional considerations). And they also said that to \"understand the algorithm\" they would code the entire thing in python (without a 3D visualizer like the one we gave them for js), without the sophisticated data structure they are supposed to use (i.e. he wants to brute force the solution in python without any acceleration queries). I tried to gently advice them to not waste their time and just sit down and understand the assignment proper.     I did not say anything in that hour, but even though it's been hours I am so... angry? Like I want to shout at this student and tell them they are being positively stupid. They want to waste hours of their time replicating 10% of the assignment (the result), when the whole point is for us to test them on their use of the data structure. Understanding the data structure IS the assignment, if you get it you can get the solution in 30 minutes. They are a PhD student in a subdiscipline of CS, I feel they should be embarrassed to be scared of properly learning the course material and finding copouts and crutches to get by instead of properly studying.     But I have no stakes on this, if they fail the assignment it's on them, not on me. Why am I so upset at this student self sabotaging by not realising they are using python as an unhealthy coping mechanism to not deal with the anxiety of learning new languages and algorithms?     Have others felt this way? Is this normal? Do I need to seek counselling? I have never gotten so angry at someone over something so inconsequential to my own status.\n\nAssistant:"

You will probably find your advisor/lab/project annoying or worse at some point regardless.  Make sure you can afford to live where you are studying. Look into additional health benefits, food benefits, etc to help reduce costs. (I know several people who had expensive unexpected surgeries in grad school.)  I switched from a career in industry to something a bit outside my experience for my PhD. As a result of being naive, and having a very enthusiastic advisor, we ended up piling way to many techniques that we didn't know how to do into my project. I learned a lot of things, but one unpublishable example of each thing working one time is not helpful. A lot of overly-complicated experiments failed in some way or other and others published simpler versions of the same grand project because they didn't try to build an overly elaborate experiment with many unfamiliar techniques. Try to avoid experiments where it takes several months of work to get a 1 N worth of data collected.  Engage other people outside your lab with your work. Give talks, presentations, get feedback, and don't be scared of criticism.

I know what the thesis will be, more or less inside and out. I have a committee, including 'important people in the field'. It's more than half done, I have most of the materials, I just can't push myself to finish it for a number of reasons.  The main trouble I have is that I think parts of it (parts that are really important for motivating it and pushed hard by my advisor and important to motivation to the thesis/funding) are largely 'crank-ish'. That is to say, I think they are really grandiose, nonsensical, and delusional. I can't make much sense of these claims when I actually look into the details of how it would work. When I ask him reasonably basic questions about the problem it is addressing, it's mostly apparent that he doesn't understand basic aspects of the problem and how they could or couldn't work. Generally speaking, I feel like someone working with a scientist from a science fiction movie where they say cool sounding future stuff, but when I look up what they're talking about it's mostly gibberish or reheated ideas that aren't quite coherent.  I have also had problems more than a couple times in the past where his skills/opinions don't line up with his claimed past in pretty brazen/flagrant ways. I don't want to get too specific, but stuff has been flubbed in ways that really shouldn't happen to anybody who isn't a complete beginner, and he'll get angry or deny it when I point out the obvious mistake that is happening. On the other hand, I can totally say the opposite as well, where I can say almost for a fact that he has to be brilliant in some categories, even if not when it comes to basic skills/critical thinking in others. This just makes things more confusing, since I pretty regularly hear things I know are 100% wrong or nonsensical in categories that are more well understood.  I really don't know what to do. Just trying to talk to people (including my advisor) over their egos is super intellectually exhausting to begin with, and now there is an added layer of me feeling potentially coached to pretend that what I'm working on makes more sense than it actually does or becoming delusional or a crank myself, which I really don't want. It's wreaking havoc on my mental health and sort of feeding itself as a problem on my psyche, and making it harder and harder to make progress. I don't want to get up in front of people and try to argue it's a good idea in ways that I don't think make sense, but I also want to get a PhD to make good on all the time I have put into this, and it's tearing me apart.  I am seeing a therapist/taking medication now, but it's only helping a tiny amount. I just really don't know what to do.\n\nAssistant:"

I have a personal bond with the last chapter of my PhD thesis\u2014I pulled it out of my ass during a make-it-or-break-it time of my degree, and I view it as the project where I gained the most amount of independence in science.  I did not leave on good terms with my PI.  She was toxic.  In the end, I had to choose between finishing my project and leaving the lab with my sanity intact.  It was difficult but ultimately I chose the latter, even though I wanted really badly to finish developing the last bits of my story.  Fast forward two years later: my ex-PI has reached out with a manuscript.  She has added a few new authors, to which I have no objection.  What I do object to is that one of the new authors has been made a co-first author (I am first co-first author), when the manuscript still appears to look very similar to the chapter that\u2019s already in my (publicly available, \u201cpublished\u201d) thesis.  How similar?  In my thesis I had at least 4 full-page figures, and these were all reused, with maybe a few quants redone and a couple of single-quant supplementary figures added.  I asked why I wasn\u2019t informed of the addition of the co-first author and was dismissed with a non-answer.  Fine, it\u2019s your lab, do what you want.  It\u2019s not even that I\u2019m objecting to this addition necessarily.  It\u2019s that I had no say nor was I ever informed of this, not even in the body of the email in which the manuscript was sent.  I have even reached out to the other co-first author and even they said that they were under the impression that they would have second authorship until days before the manuscript was sent to me.  This is an example of the toxicity that I am thankful to have escaped.  My ex-PI rushed me to give my consent for submission, which happened this week.  I now wonder if it\u2019s completely stupid for me to withdraw my name from the paper?  My reasoning:  1) The two years since cutting my PI out of my life have been liberating, and my mental health has never been better.  She gets back in touch this week and has already wreaked this much havoc.  Withdrawing my name means I cut off my last tie with her forever, sparing me of having to be in touch with her during the revision/resubmission period.    2) I have successfully transitioned myself out of academia.  I do not necessarily need this publication on my CV.  3) As I mentioned, I do have a personal connection with the story.  If I withdraw, then my name is associated only with the version of the story I really care about, which is the version in my thesis (of which, of course, I am rightfully sole first author).  4) Everyone else gets a bump in authorship so it\u2019s not like their work goes unnoticed\u2014maybe even the opposite?  Am I missing something?  Is this a stupid thing to do?  Is it even possible to do at this point?  Are there any glaringly obvious negatives (outside of me missing out on this publication)?  Thanks for sticking with me to the end of this post\u2014appreciate it!\n\nAssistant:"

Of course, horticulture might not be rice paddy cultivation but it's still agriculture.  Nonetheless, he finds signs that this is a worldwide dynamic that shows up where ever you have a geographic or temporal transition between densely settled agriculture and a lower-density space that makes \"less civilized\" lifeways possible.  One space he keeps coming back to is the Eastern/Midwestern US of the 1500s and 1600s, when the post Columbian contact plagues and their associated population collapses gave the survivors plenty of elbow room to make this transition."

He believed myths, fairy tales and legends are not so much about their actual explicit content but rather about unconscious structures of human mind hidden beneath. The structures in his view were constructed from systems of binary oppostitions (up-down, living-dead, old-young etc.).   In a nutshell, L\u00e9vi-Strauss thinks myths could act as a sort of simulation where you can let interact these oppositions and solve dilemmas and conflicts human mind comes into. A recurring motif in a lot of myths is a \"a mediator\" or \"a trickster\", something that defies the binary categories , something between that can bring the oppositions closer, such as fog (not a liquid nor gas, not transparent nor opaque) or scavengers (not herbivores nor predators) etc.  Sunshower also looks like such mediator because it's both rain and sunshine, it's cold from rain and it's warm from sun rays... This would connect it to the \"trickster animals\" menitoned in the wiki article.  I can recommend you read something about L\u00e9vi-Strauss' structuralism but I warn you it's a bit speculative approach in anthropology.

Adams and Mt. Hood (They both have different names in the various local languages, so I'm keeping it simple and using their contemporary Anglo names).  Mssrs Lewis and Clark didn't necessarily know what to make of such tales, but come to find out, some 200 years later, geologists and hydrologists have definitively affirmed that such a thing did in fact occur; that there was once a giant sort of natural bridge across the Columbia Gorge, that there was a massive Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake roughly 150 years prior to the L and C Expedition, and that said massive earthquake definitely caused the collapse of said giant natural bridge, which is kind of a shame, since it must have been one of the great natural wonders of the world when it existed."

The field has been expanding it's methodology for identification and classification significantly over the past 10-20 years and this has caused some disruption in the timeline placement of some species. With the introduction of DNA (Human Genome Project) mapping and the relative cost of analyzing fossil DNA with comparison to Sapien Sapiens reducing, the data is better suited to be put on to the internet rather than distributed through hard copy.       Also, your timeline might be a bit exaggerated for what you are trying to accomplish. I'd suggest sticking to the past 10 million years. Limit the data that you are putting forward to them, concentrate your efforts a bit.       To get to your question though:  \\- I'd first start off with asking them if they believe in a 3 billion year old earth. If they don't, then you'll have an expanded task to bring them to evolutionary theory.  \\- Secondly, and if they are in agreement about the age of the earth, I'd ask them if they believe in Selection Pressure affecting other organisms? (ie domestication of wolves leading to different dog breeds, etc) Whether it be through natural selection or artificial, it doesn't matter, the point is 'do they know what it is and do they agree that it exists'. It's an important foundation to evolutionary theory.  \\[The eye is another good explanation of adaptive selection\\]  \\- Then I'd follow up with a basic explanation of 'this same process affected apes'. Climate change in southern Africa caused some species to transition to bipedalism (fewer trees, growing savanna) in search of food. This started slowly and later developed into 100% bipedal motion. (As evidenced by hip/pelvic bones, and the spinal cord entry into the base of the skull)  \\- Successful in this new environment, a wide variety of species began to fragment with specializations for various food groups. Some maintained leafy or nut diets, while others adopted a more omnivore approach.  \\- Through 8-2mya, we have fossil evidence for significant diversity in hominids, approximately 10 or so different species existing across Africa. Various selection pressures led to tool making (Habalis), better diets led to running (Erectus), which led to expansion out of Africa, which led to expanded specializations (Neanderthal, Denisova, etc).  \\- Its currently uncertain as to where the first Sapien appeared, but it is narrowed to either northern Africa or Mesopotamia. Sapiens effectively we're better at hunting and adapting to all environments as the ice age ended and therefore are the only hominids to survive.  \\- It's also known through DNA that European Sapiens have on average 3% Neanderthal DNA and Asian Sapien's also have an average of 3% Neanderthal DNA, but different DNA strands were carried within each line. Whereas, African Sapiens are are pure Sapiens (as best we know it).  \\- Sapien evolution hasn't stopped. There are several genetic groups of Sapien, and for contrast I like to use the Inuit (thicker, shorter bones) and the Sherpas (there cells are better at handling lowered oxygen levels).       There are several references you can use online (videos, infographics, etc). I'd recommend having this saved and ready to access before talking with them.       I will try to reply to this post with links to all of these points."

That's a myth, though.  Adult human beings have always been the biggest bad asses around, even if animals like lions and such are bigger and stronger than us.    A bite from a lion *might* kill a human being, but a stab from a spear *will* kill an adult lion. Can you think of where on your body you could be stabbed and not need medical care to live?  Even basic care like a bandage or a guy to hold pressure is beyond a lion.  As long as we're in groups, we're untouchable.  That's why babies cry, because they need to be part of the group. If they're on the ground in the middle of a field, they're vulnerable to exposure even if they're quiet and still and no predator finds them.  If they cry, they might attract a predator, but hopefully mom or dad will show up with weapons and a safe group first. They're dead for sure if they're quiet, but they have a chance if they cry.  Similar situation for warring tribes, but that was much less of a problem when *Sapiens* was evolving, since there were a lot fewer of us.  Babies crying might be aggravating, and I've had two, I've been there, but it is *the* mark of our dominance over this world.  Our babies, some of the most useless and dependent children evolution has ever produced, scream at the top of their lungs without any innate fear because they don't have an evolutionary need to be afraid because daddy and mommy will banish the darkness with fire and banish the predators at the point of a spear."

You can see broad examples of everyday egalitarianism even in hyper-modern communities by examining any social dynamics with no clear rulers or hierarchies and where those within such dynamics come to general consensus on decisions without dictation (many friend groups do this).  There is a catch in the semantics you use, as the very term \"formal civilization\" is/was defined by the very people (us) who both exist within and define \"civilization\" to begin with. Again, anthropologically speaking, we can examine multiple forms of human society and without coloring our language needlessly with terms like \"formal\" in regards to assigning values of success or legitimacy. That being said, egalitarian tribal/band societies have proven both successful and legitimate throughout the entirety of human history and into the present. There is something to be said about the rise of civilization being prompted by the advent of intensive agriculture (high-energy/low-nutrient monocrops) and carried on a wave of subsequent population growth (due to the nature and abundance of this food) that has, both intentionally and unintentionally, eclipsed other indigenous human societies and manifested hierarchies of competition and conquest (generally for resources, including power). In essence, \"civilized\" societies were more numerous, voracious, and ruthlessly competitive (as the nature of such society necessitates such expansion) and thus have annihilated or drowned-out other societies. These other societies, however, still exist and, more/less, quite successfully despite their struggles."

If any resident anthropologists with expertise about the region know about this, please chime in about the plausibility:  EVERETT:\u00a0I originally went to the Piraha as a missionary to translate the Bible into their language, but over the course of many years, they wound up converting me, and I became a scientist instead, and studied their culture and its effects on their language.  DUBNER:\u00a0The Piraha live in huts, sleep on the ground, hunt with bows and arrows. But what really caught Everett\u2019s attention is that they are relentlessly happy. Really happy.  EVERETT:\u00a0This happiness and this contentment really had a lot to do with me abandoning my religious goals, and my religion altogether, because they seemed to have it a lot more together than most religious people I knew.  DUBNER:\u00a0But this isn\u2019t just another story about some faraway tribe that\u2019s really happy even though they don\u2019t have all the stuff that we have. It\u2019s a story about something that happened during Everett\u2019s early days with the tribe. He and his wife and their three young kids had just finished dinner. Everett gathered about thirty Piraha in his hut to preach to them.  EVERETT:\u00a0I was still a very fervent Christian missionary, and I wanted to tell them how God had changed my life.  So, I told them a story about my stepmother and how she had committed suicide because she was so depressed and so lost, for the word depressed I used the word sad. So she was very sad. She was crying. She felt lost. And she shot herself in the head, and she died. And this had a large spiritual impact on me, and I later became a missionary and came to the Piraha because of all of this experience triggered by her suicide. And I told this story as tenderly as I could, and tried to communicate that it had a huge impact on me. And when I was finished everyone burst out laughing.  [THEME]  ANNOUNCER:\u00a0From WNYC and APM, American Public Media, this is Freakonomics Radio. Today: The Suicide Paradox. Here\u2019s your host, Stephen Dubner.  DUBNER:\u00a0All right, so Dan Everett was sharing this sad, intimate story about his step-mother\u2019s suicide with the Piraha \u2026  EVERETT:\u00a0When I asked them why are you laughing, they said: \u201cShe killed herself. That\u2019s really funny to us. We don\u2019t kill ourselves. You mean, you people, you white people shoot yourselves in the head? We kill animals, we don\u2019t kill ourselves.\u201d They just found it absolutely inexplicable, and without precedent in their own experience that someone would kill themselves.  DUBNER:\u00a0In the thirty years that Everett has been studying the Piraha, there have been zero suicides. Now, it\u2019s not that suicide doesn\u2019t happen in the Amazon \u2013 for other tribes, it\u2019s a problem.  EVERETT:\u00a0And as I\u2019ve told this story, some people have suggested that, well it\u2019s because they don\u2019t have the stresses of modern life. But that\u2019s just not true. There is almost one hundred percent endemic malaria among the people. They\u2019re sick a lot. Their children die at probably about seventy-five percent. Seventy-five percent of the children die before they reach the age of five or six. These are astounding pressures.

But many posters like /u/magicsauc3's response actually reflect a number of academic theories currently out there about why the Neanderthals might have buried their dead. As well as the point that since the Neanderthals didn't leave any writing behind we can't ever know for sure what was going on in their heads. So even academics are still just making educated guesses. As long as posters admit they are not speaking authoritatively, for posts like this it is hard to require \"accurate\" answers because there aren't any.   But for a more academic approach, you can read this article, which discusses whether they were intentional and the different arguments about it.. Essentially, the primary hypotheses are:   1. Burying dead for practical reasons: prevent scavengers from coming around, bad smells, disease, etc. 2. Accidental burials: Bodies just happened to end up in holes because they died there, scavengers drop them there, or it was a trash pit and bodies were among other trash thrown in there (this last point arguing against items found with bodies being offerings.) 3. Burying the dead because of sentiment: there may have been no concept of an afterlife but they still didn't want to watch a loved one rot and/or be consumed by scavengers & bugs.  4. Burying for religious reasons: there was a concept that some part of the person continued after death, which is why some sites may indicate the presence of grave goods. Heavy emphasis on later more well understood burial practices of *Homo sapien sapiens* being a continuation of this line of thinking/belief.   You may have seen the recent interest in a study about Neanderthal burials. The primary reason it was exciting was that the authors claimed it definitively proved the burials at their site were purposeful. The bones had no evidence of being gnawed on by scavengers and they argued that the holes were not naturally made."

One culture might see reliable river transportation as a problem to be solved, and another may not. One culture might derive value from the commodification of resources and another might derive value in largesse and sharing: both of those cultures will solve the knock-on problems of those value judgements very differently. So if one culture develops industrial capitalism as a result and another develops potlatching, they can't be judged in the same way, because ultimately they're expressions of a totally different set of problems to be solved.   Like another poster mentioned, a lot of seemingly simple solutions to common problems are technology. Birchbark or dugout canoes are technology. Trap building is technology. Enthnogeography is technology. Social hierarchies built around trade and hunting are technology.   If we look at technology only as the stuff that created ocean sailing vessels or spaceships, then we're falling into the trap created by enlightenment and imperialist thinkers that were asking the question \"why did white people win history\" instead of \"how did cultures perceive their needs and solve their problems related to those needs.\""

Michael Taussig, who is a bit out there and a bit dated but still worth considering, argues in *The Devil and Commodity Fetishism* that stories of run-ins with the devil in the sugarcane fields of Colombia and the mines of Potosi are basically critiques of capitalism, with the capitalist cast in the role of Satan.

They understand there is a lot of sentiment from local tribes about this sort of thing. I really don\u2019t care for those in the tribes advocating for the collections of these bodies for four reasons.  1. When a body is located anywhere in california, there is 3-6 tribes disputing who\u2019s it belongs to. This alone is a waste of time. It\u2019s almost entirely speculation of which tribe the body was associated with, usually it will go to the closest tribal region. (If its found in Coastal Miwok territory, it will be deemed Coastal Miwok unless proven otherwise).   2. The borders defined are based on modern delineations for the most part. In California specifically borders changed a lot. Tribes would be constantly changing their influential spheres often merging and separating from each other making it redundant to assign the remains of a body to a certain region just based on modern delineation.  3. There was so much information about native american history that has been destroyed or misinformed. I have a real pet-peeve when I go into information museums, put on by local tribe members, who don\u2019t have accurate information. For example when I go into the Maidu historic center, I should  be seeing the unique culture and history of the Maidu, not the highly stereotyped horse riding plain indians, and accompanied by headdresses. While those features are interesting to place them in the context of California Natives is incorrect and disrespectful to other Tribes identity. In short, scientists really help shape what knowledge we know. Not all Indians made acorn pancakes, some had rich culture in diving for abalone shells. Some avoided the mountains due to greater predators. All very unique identities that many tribal members ignore.   4. When the research has been done, in almost every case, researchers have been willing to return remains in mostly enact and respected conditions. If there is a truly unique case, where the remains need to be preserved or presented in a museum, the tribe should be in full support of the academic community.  These litigations of who has the right to the remains it really disrupting for a lot of people. If a body is found on a construction site that could be the remains of a tribe, there has to be an anthropologist,  a tribal representative, lawyers, construction managers, police investigators, and all the work, excavation, and removal of the body, are all postponed and can cause a a lot of short tempers in the summer heat.  It is only a few loud tribal members who are so against the academic collection of remains who make it difficult. A lot of people of the community don\u2019t have an opinion to chime in."

In today's world there are some practices that superficially resemble religious rituals:  * If the Olympic torch goes out while enroute to the stadium, it must be relit from a backup flame that was lit at the same place as the torch and is transported in a support vehicle. * In many countries, while handling the flag you should not let it touch the ground, and worn-out flags should be disposed of respectfully. While this has been codified into law in a few countries, presumably the idea came long before the law. * Many athletes eat a specific meal before an important game not part of the usual training, or wear specific items not part of the standard uniform.  However, if you were to ask any of the people involved in these practices what their religious beliefs are, I imagine they would in the aggregate have the same religious beliefs of the populations from which they come, and compartmentalize their religion from the above sort of practices. E.g. an athlete would think of their superstition differently from how they think of their religion.  **Do anthropologists have a word for these kinds of practices?** When researching cultures distant from themselves in time or in familiarity, especially where there are few written records, how do they determine whether a practice that that culture carried out (other than functional or aesthetic I suppose) was a religious practice, or whether it was something more like this?\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " This is a big question.  A popular place to start would be Geertz's \"Religion as a Cultural System\". It's a pretty good read; I'll post his definition of religion here:  > a religion is: (1) a system of symbols which acts to (2) establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by (3) formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and (4) clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that (5) the moods and motivations seem uniquely realist  And that's a good one! But if you know anything about Geertz, you know that, for him, everything cultural is about symbols and the way symbols are shared and affect behavior.  Are there any other definitions?  In the introduction to a recent-ish collection of essays on the anthropology of religion, Michael Lambek gives the following summary of ways anthropologists have defined religion:  > In place of substantive definitions, is religion better seen as an ongoing function of society or mind, rather than a distinct object within the former or discrete product of  the  latter?  Is  it  society's  means  or  moment  of  recognizing  (or misrecognizing)  itself, as Durkheim argued, or perhaps of motivating its members, as Weber proposed? Is it culture\u2019s means or mode of establishing truth and anchoring reality, as suggested variously by  Berger and Luckmann , Geertz, or Rappaport? Is religion social hierarchy\u2019s means of asserting its legitimacy and mystifying the workings of power and exploitation,  as  conveyed  in  the  Marxist  tradition?  (During  the  Cold  War,  the  famous  Hungarian  mathematician  Paul  Erd\u00f6s  impishly  referred  to  God  as  The  Supreme  Fascist.)  Is  it  the  inevitable  product  or  by-product  of  the  workings  of  the  mind,  whether  of  fantasy  and  projection,  as  in  Freud,  or  as  elaborations  of  the  rational  impulse to distinguish, classify, compare, mediate, order, and unify things in the world, as in L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Douglas, or theorists of rhetoric or cognition? Is it the places where the mind acknowledges the limits of its own understanding, or is it the recognition of authentically transcendental experiences, the acknowledgment of manifestly extra-human  sources  of  well-being  (and  misfortune),  beauty  (and  horror),  power  (and  abjection), goodness (and evil), truth (and perplexity)? Is it only when some set of these diverse functions conjoin in perduring symbols and practices or manifest in ritual performances, or when the mental products and experiences coalesce and are rationalized and stabilized in scriptural traditions, material artifacts, or formal institutions that we speak, or should speak, of \u201creligion\u201d?   Clearly, there are many things that one author would consider religious and another would not, and things that they would both consider religion but mean entirely different things by that designation.   The entire intro is free to read, if a bit dense. Still, I find it a good overview of the ways anthropology has approached religion because it challenges us to rephrase the question \"What *is* religion?\" to \"What can anthropology contribute to studies of religion?\" and vice versa.  Like any big meta-level term, spending too much time delineating what *is* religious and what *isn't* will say a lot more about the definition of religion I've chosen to use than about the phenomena at hand. \"How do you define religion?\" is a sort of Rorschach test for theorists; their answer will tell you a lot about how they view human culture. Thus, it can better to ask instead:  *If I interpret this ritual as religious, how does that help me understand it?*  If I define a given ritual as \"religious,\" I would rarely do so to make any solid, ontological claims about its nature. Such claims should derive from my observation of the practice and participants' understandings of it. Rather, I am positioning the practice within a larger body of knowledge about \"religion\" generally, as if to signal to you, the reader, what lens it should be read through.  Generally, anthropologists will engage with the discourse on Religion when they are interested in the institutionalization of beliefs (e.g. ritual specialists, dedicated spaces, formal ways of passing down knowledge), in public rather than private ritual (e.g. ceremonies with open participation and with a commonly understood meaning ), in explicit engagement with otherworldly beings (e.g. with a god in \"heaven\"), or in ways people rationalize and construct their cosmology as a whole.   As such, while it's possible to interpret *anything* as a religious act, and, indeed, there are many who would understand everything they do to be religious on some level, that doesn't mean it will be the most fruitful way to discuss a practice.   An athlete's pre-game meal, for instance, is usually a personal ritual not shared with others and not formally \"official,\" and it needn't involve some higher power or have any significance to the rest of the player's life. Likewise, the torch ceremony has no meaning outside the Olympics and is watched but not participated in.  If I start talking about these things the way people have talked about \"obvious\" example of religion, will it get me anywhere? Will it contextualize anything? Probably not.  But what happens when this player says a short prayer before eating that meal? They've tied themselves up in a larger, socially shared, cosmologically significant practice. It might be interesting, then to consider how this ritual is an individual expression of a cultural idea, i.e. of religion."

From this source and others, I would endorse the general view that in equatorial regions, where plant productivity is higher, women tend to produce 50%-80% of more the calories consumed, while within mid and high latitudes, where plant productivity is lower, men's food production tends to increase. There is an extensive literature on this topic and I'll share here some sources that I would recommend looking at. Before getting your hopes too high, know that measuring food production and food consumption is very difficult, and that almost each paper on this topic has used different methods and assumptions to produce final figures. Some papers consider the relative weight of food produced by men and women, others the relative calories, for example. Some are based on long-term observation, some on very short field visits. The values that are produced are certainly subject to a lot of measurement error, and in many cases, it is completely unknown what methods the original ethnographer used! For people who do modern and serious work on this topic, it involves close behavioral observation, weighing of food, nutritional analyses of the food, and ideally, long-term observation allowing for estimates of food production across seasons. Remember that hunter-gatherers are opportunistic and diet varies locally and across seasons, and rare events (such as killing a large animal) can have a huge effect on any estimates made. Here are some additional publications (there are many) that would be worth reading that address some of these issues:   Seasonality in a Foraging Society: Variation in Diet, Work Effort, Fertility, and Sexual Division of Labor among the Hiwi of Venezuela A.

Even when I do calligraphy with a quill it doesn't work well if I hold it at too much of an angle. Carving and pressing clay also mean that smudging isn't an issue.   I can't really think of any other benefit/detriment when it comes to direction for writing. Writing systems seem to have developed independently in different places. So if you're thinking about how to take spoken words and impart them into a fixed medium there is no practical reason why those symbols need to go in any particular direction. Either direction works just fine as long as everyone learning the system does the same thing."

The White Sands footprints is the latest of these and seems nicely definitive, I have not been able to find any real challenges to the dating or identification, but it does raise a bit of a problem in that the Clovis culture, aside from matching up neatly with some bits of paleoclimate research, is pretty widespread and Clovis points are plentiful. Meanwhile the pre-Clovis sites are a handful of what appear to be temporary campsites, not exactly Altamira. What I have read (which is almost exclusively popular rather than academic) seems to gleefully point out that \"Clovis First\" is finally dead without noticing that this seems to open up a massive gap in the material record.  Is this a problem of misidentification, in that sites that were \"pre-Clovis\" were incorrectly dated and now might be reassessed? Is it possible that the Clovis culture itself is wrongly dated and so it isn't so much \"pre-Clovis\" as Clovis point makers being in the Americas much earlier than was thought?

Neanderthals are thought to have needed about twice the calories per day that *H. sapiens* needs.  This leads to all sorts of implications for infant survival, resource competition with us (and other Neanderthal or Denisovan groups), reduced survival in lean times, and more.  This idea has been around for a while, but it's been gaining more traction in recent years as we gain a better understanding of Neanderthal life and physiology.  One of the advantages of this hypothesis is its simplicity and how neatly it fits into the combination of factors that took place around their extinction (eg. climate changes, competition from a novel species, etc) and helps to explain otherwise puzzling things, like the low and very dispersed population density of Neanderthals.  As with all answers in evolution, ecology, and anthropology there is likely no single factor, but a combination of factors that all play a part, and when those factors come together in just the wrong way the effects are far more dramatic on a species than the would be separately.  If you want as complete an answer as you're likely to get to this and other Neanderthal questions, pick up a copy of Rebecca Sykes' book *Kindred*.  She's an anthropologist who compiled what's currently the most comprehensive look at their lives and extinction based on scientific evidence.  - Steegmann, et al 2002 *Neandertal cold adaptation: Physiological and energetic factors*   - Froehle & Churchill 2009 *Energetic Competition Between Neandertals and Anatomically Modern Humans* - PDF link   - Cole 2017 *Assessing the calorific significance of episodes of human cannibalism in the Palaeolithic* - if you ever needed to know how many calories you'd get by eating someone, this your reference   - Venner 2018 *A New Estimate for Neanderthal Energy Expenditure* - Master's Thesis - PDF link   - Sykes 2020 *Kindred: Neanderthal Life, Love, Death and Art* - book review"

It's a drop cookie with chocolate dough, chocolate chips, toasted marshmallows, and Milk Bar's Graham crust pieces.  What I did for the marshmallow this time is lay them out on a sheet tray, torch them, ziploc them and freeze them until mixing time.   The marshmallows have two issues.  1.) Most of them still get destroyed by the mixing paddle. The first time I did this recipe, I just threw in plain marshmallows straight from the bag and they got demolished. I thought that if I toasted them for a more genuine smores flavor, and froze them to harden them, they would survive mixing this time. But even after freezing, they are still very delicate from being so airy, and most get ground up and stretched out mixing into this cookie dough. Maybe I'm altering the sugar structure too much by torching then? Some puff up considerably from the application of heat. Would it be better to try untoasted, frozen marshmallows next time?   2.) In the oven, the marshmallow tends to melt and spread out, and if this is a marshmallow bit that was at the edge of the cookie, it might start to caramelize on the sheet tray it's baking on.  I know that I'm far from the first person to put marshmallow into a cookie, so what am I missing here?\n\nAssistant:"

A couple hours ago, when my final bread came out of the oven, it was pretty dense and almost flat (there were some air bubbles inside, but very few).  I'll try to recreate what I did.  **Yesterday**  - Mixed 100g of bread flour with 100ml of water. Added a pinch of store-bought sourdough starter. - Covered with a towel, let it rest over night.  **This morning**  - Saw the poolish has risen. It had been about 12h. - Added 250 ml of water. Added salt. - Added 400g of flour (bread flour + whole weat flour + some all-purpose flour). - The water got completely absorbed, so I added an extra ~50ml of water. - Cover and let it rest for 45 mins. - **After 45 mins**, the mixture doesn't look active at all. I do a first fold. Cover again. - **After 15 mins**, the mixture doesn't look active at all. I do a second fold. Cover again. - **After 15 mins**, the mixture doesn't look active at all. I do a third fold. Cover again. - **After 30 mins**, I put the dough on the table, and shape something that vaguely looks like a _boule_. Transfer to my dutch oven. I start heating the oven to max heat.  - **After 45 mins**, the dough has been raising for a total time somewhere between 2.5 and 3h, I put it in the oven. Temperature 260C for 30 mins. - **After 30 mins** in the oven, I remove the lid of the dutch oven. Give it 15 etxra minutes.  The resulting bread is relatively flat and dense. The flavor is good, and the outside crust is exactly how I like it, but the inside of the bread is disappointing.  I'm planning to do it again tomorrow, so I need help identifying what I missed.

I stop whisking when it looks smooth, but after a second of sitting there, or if i scrape the bowl to bring everything together, it curdles. It\u2019s like the mixture around the sides and underneath is curdled but the stuff on top is smooth.  It smooths out when I add the flour, but it takes a lot of beating and I have to put it in the oven straight away because it starts looking lumpy if I let it sit in the bowl for even a couple of minutes.  Does anyone have any ideas as to why this happens?\n\nAssistant:"

This is usually why I'd avoid silicone bakeware, unless I happened to be baking low-temperature dishes where insulation could be a desired quality, which is rarely actually the case.  If I were to recommend you something, it would be using a baking stone or baking steel; the heavy amount of mass causes things to make less noise as you drop and slide metals against each other, which you can just keep in the oven all the time, and combine this with a good heavy bottom pan such as cast-iron skillets, and the probability of anything voilently bending or vibrating becomes pretty low, although yes it does still happen.  I would also just highly recommend just putting in some ear-plugs, having worked in construction, those really help me with loud noises. Essentially it tries to block out loud noises, while keeping quieter noises within the audible range, so you can still hear people talk for example."

Whether I am making croissant, Danish, or  puff, I use cold butter right from the walk in and beat it  with a rolling pin until it is pliable. I get great results from this, the butter ends up pliable and remains cold.  Over the years, I have worked in many bakeries and restaurants, and used many brands of butter. Occasionally, we will get a batch of butter that breaks when it is hit with the rolling pin.  It kind of falls apart instead of becoming malleable.  This is not a regular thing, but some brands seem to do it more often then other brands. At my current job we use the beloved Plugra, and I just had a case of Plugra that did this same thing.  Someone once told me that this is a result of the butter having been frozen, but I am pretty  sure that this is not the real cause. Our Plugra arrives frozen sometimes, and still works beautifully. Someone else told me it has to do with how quickly the milk is cooled after being pasteurized in the production stage. Does anybody out there know for sure what causes the butter to behave in this way? To be clear, it still works fine for pastries when it is like this, it just is a mess and is less pleasant to work with. Thank you for your input.\n\nAssistant:"

If it\u2019s a warm day, or the cows have a lot of saturated fat in their diet (like palm oil), the butter will tend towards a higher melting point. If it\u2019s a cold day, the melting point will likely decrease.

Just for the hell of it I tried a few different ways to beat meringue and I was still able to get it to stiff peaks even though most people say not to do these  &#x200B;  \"**If you get even a drop of yolk in start again**\": This is probably the one that kick started my testing. I accidentally pinched the yolk and got some in with my last egg. I decided to go ahead with it because those were the only unrefridgerated ones I had. I had no issue. HOWEVER, there is a certain amount of egg yolk that you can add and cause it to never get stiff. So there is some truth to this, just not as absolute as everyone said.  &#x200B;  \"**Never use cold eggs**\": No issue with 3 cold eggs. It took roughly the same time to beat to stiff even when they came straight from the fridge. This was also an accidental testing because I forgot to leave some out and decided to not wait.  **\"Always keep your equipment Fat and oil free\"**: I was able to beat 3 egg whites and a table spoon of veg oil with no issue. I also separated the eggs by letting the egg white drip through my fingers. I also used a plastic bowl (which can trap oils). No issues with doing all of those together.  &#x200B;  \"**Put sugar in bit by bit to not knock out the air**\": I tried putting in 1/2 of it and also tried dumping it all in without issues. It was much more convenient and I didn't notice any improvement or quality from slow feeding in sugar.  &#x200B;  \"**Always dry out your egg whites before beating them**\" : To be honest I've never heard of this before so I've always just started beating the moment I've separated. I tried it by letting it sit for an hour or 2 and didn't notice any difference.  &#x200B;  **I'm curious from other bakers here if there are any validity to these myths** or if they are causing a side effect somewhere down the line (flavor, texture etc) that I'm not realizing. My 'testing' was only regarding beating into stiff peaks, not anything else.  &#x200B;  My suspicion is that if you were beating with a whisk maybe these would be useful tips, but with a stand or hand mixer I think these tips aren't set in stone\n\nAssistant:"

(There are lots of things you can do to make each L of displacement generate more heat, but that's a separate subject.  All things being equal, more displacement = more heat = more power.)  Edit: good point from galoluscus in order to be clearer.  While displacement is a measure of how much air/fuel can be moved once per revolution, the amount of air /fuel that is actually processed by the engine is half that in a 4 stroke.

My friend was making his 3 hour drive back home yesterday, having borrowed his family's 2008 Honda Pilot, doing about 90 down the highway when the car basically catastrophically fails, accelerator immediately stops functioning, all the warning lights come on, and he pulls over immediately. He gets it towed somewhere and the guy says the timing belt snapped. (Entirely owner error: it's his mom's car and she never got the belt replaced as per routine maintenance guidelines). Like I said, it's a 2008, and I think he said it was 114k miles.   From everything I've read, it sounds like it's almost certain the engine is shot (interference engine and all that). Currently the car is still at that shop. His family knows nothing about cars and is just trying to weigh their options right now.  From my understanding, they can either buy a replacement engine and pay to have it put in (from what I saw online, probably $2-4k for an engine, plus labor). Or they can just sell it. This is where I'm not really sure what the options are. Obviously it can't be sold as a drive-able car. What kind of value would it have as just parts? I can't imagine very much.   Any knowledge, information, advice, recommendations etc is appreciated. It seems like it's gonna be shitty no matter what - but hey, that's why you keep up with routine maintenance. If there's another option that I'm missing, please let me know. Otherwise, it's just a matter of weighing the pros and cons of the two available and deciding which to do.\n\nAssistant:"

I recently paid ~$600 to get all my brake pads and front two rotors replaced on my 2014 Hyundai Sonata at a national chain maintenence shop (I know it's way cheaper to replace brake pads myself, I just don't trust myself to do it right). One day later, my brakes gave out while I was driving on one of my city's busier highways. I was honestly pretty lucky to be able to pull over without hitting anybody/getting hit. After pulling over and regrouping (read: letting out a therapeutic amount of expletives), I limped the car back to the maintenance shop (after hours) with a combination of the little brake pressure it had left, the parking brake, and pure faith.  I went to the shop first thing in the morning to drop off the car key and explain what happened to the manager. He's a friendly older guy and a bit of a smooth talker, for sure. He seemed surprised. I went to work - After not hearing from them for a few hours, I called around lunch time to ask about the car. He told me that one of the rear slider bolts was completely missing and the caliper had slid out and pushed on the brake lines.   When I picked up the car after work, I asked how the slider bolt could have gone missing. He was pretty adamant that it had fallen off the car after I had left the shop (I probably drove a total of 25 miles, maybe), possibly due to it not being tightened enough by a incorrectly positioned torque wrench. I asked if it's possible that the bolt was left off altogether when they reassembled the brake unit, but he was very clear that the \"kid [he] trained [him]self\" wouldn't have left the bolt off because it was a routine repair.   They replaced the caliper for free (he says a $500 value) and called it even. I decided not to press it because I didn't feel that I knew enough to challenge it any further and I knew I could call the corporate customer service line once I got more information.  So, friendly reddit car guys, should I be pushing for a refund of my original $600 payment? Could the slider bolt really have falled out of my brake mechanism? Is this mechanic just covering his ass?

Hey folks, so we have had a broken down Ford Ranger Splash with minor body damage sitting on our property since around 2010 which was given to us by a coworker of my mom's who was in the process of moving out of state and didn't have the resources to bring the vehicle with them so we had essentially taken the truck off their hands to help them out without any intention on fixing it back up to driving condition. Due to lack of necessity, we never acquired the title, registration, or any of the vehicles documentation which leads me to my question.  I now have a friend who is willing to take it off of our hands for free as a project vehicle, and plans to eventually restore the vehicle. My friend is aware of the document-less vehicle he will be acquiring but what I am wondering is that since there will be no paid transaction or official transfer of ownership when he comes to pick up the vehicle, are there still any documents, paperwork such as an abandoned vehicle affidavit or anything along the lines that my friend may eventually need from us?  A potential future issue I can foresee has to do with my mom longer being in contact with the original owner and we have no way to get ahold of them in the event of my friend needing  information/documentation of proof of original ownership. Does anyone with more knowledge on the subject have any input on how best to go about transferring the vehicle over to my friend?  I probably could and should have shortened my question a bit, but if you guys need any further info. please feel free to let me know. Any advice is welcomed and very much appreciated, thanks.\n\nAssistant:"

My vehicle isn't telling me either way (don't we wish they could talk sometimes. )  If it's needed,  I'm in a 2005 Chevrolet Trailblazer EXT with the Vortec 4200 inline 6. Got about 128,380 miles on it. Next oil change calls for 130,000-something miles but didn't give any particular date. (Or it's faded out.)   It was late December when I got it done, and thanks to being able to take my work truck home, I've maybe put 1000 miles on the Trailblazer.

Your vehicle can't talk, but you CAN get a good idea of how healthy the engine is. There's a place called Blackstone that will analyze the oil, looking at the types of contaminants and the lubricity characteristics. They can even tell you things like if your air filter is insufficient or there's a crack in the intake plumbing based on what they see in the sample. They will also be able to tell you if you need to shorten or are able to lengthen the service interval. It's not expensive ($30-$40 IIRC), and all done through the mail.

But why is a magnetic oil drain plug more important than spending $2 on any of 1,000 other random parts.  Cars contain tens of thousands of parts and every single one of those parts has a budget that they need to stay within in order to hit a certain price point for the total vehicle. Would a magnetic oil drain plug be nice, yes it would.    But the REAL question here is, would it sell more vehicles.  If you compared it to spending a few bucks more on the climate control knob to make it have a more satisfying click.  I'd argue that the climate knob having a nice click will sell more cars than a magnetic oil drain plug.  In fact, I'd wager that the vast majority of car buyers (even ones that change their own oil) have no idea if their car has a magnetic grain plug or not prior to purchasing the vehicle.

On to your specific question, try to hedge your bets: if you've parked in someone's driveway and are just popping up to their door to drop off the food: leave the car running. If you're going to be gone more than 3 min or so, turn the car off. Idling for long periods is bad for the engine, and wasteful.

Alternatively, you sell it and go buy a 3 year old CPO car fresh off a lease and keep it for another 3 years, net cost is $15k. On average you will lose $5k in value on that newer car anyway.

Generally speaking, if you want higher RPMs, you'll maintain stroke, but replace the rotating assembly with more-stout forged pieces. You'll also be looking at aftermarket cams, valve springs, retainers, and potentially the valves themselves.    However, the thing that could be the biggest issue is one that's often forgotten: oiling. Spinning a factory oil pump gear set faster than it was designed for can often lead to starvation, cavitation, or fatigue issues.    Extra RPMs are hard (and potentially expensive) to achieve, with few exceptions (e.g. Honda.) The thing that makes building high-RPM Honda engines so easy is the universality, interoperability, and ubiquity of compatible OEM parts, as well as a giant offering of aftermarket parts."

I have a head injury  and I think I did a bad job of trying to explain this concept to my neice.    So my niece and I Were having a conversation about sweets. She is not allowed much sugar... I'm not complaining. Her mom gets to decide what is allowed, but i want to answer G's question well.   She had heard her mother and I arguing that though my Italian meringue recipe had 1.5 cups sugar & 6 egg whites, it expanded to 6-8 cups and therefore 2 tsp of merengue has a very small ammout of sugar relatively speaking (i havent calculated the grams)  So her question was:  Aunt Jenn, how can some foods have less sugar but taste as sweet as something with a lot?   I had a Really, really hard tome coming up with a simple explanation that was easy to understand.   I think the answer also has something to do with both the carrier of the sugar, and in the case of the meringue I believe it is because it is whipped in a foam so your taste buds get a full dose as it sticks and spreads in your mouth in an unctuous way... It would be close to the same sweetness if you ate a marshmallow (only most of the sugar would go down to your stomach before you really tasted it... which would make you eat more sugar  Another example i have two non-dairy coffee creamers of the same brand but different spices. Each has 3 grams of sugar but one tastes Super Sweet. I think it is the pumpkin spices.   I think it also has to something do do with the mouth feel and how long the sugar lingers and spreads?  Like creamy things vs water. Water leaves your mouth faster.   Dark chocolate might have 3 grams if sugar and taste sweet (because if the oil?) But m&m's are loaded and tast about as sweet (well no bitter notes).  Different spices enhance, drinking seltzer cleans the taste buds and allows more impact.   I tried explaining that if she sucked on a lollipop for 2 minutes, or if she crunched it up and swallowed it that same two minutes, the sweetness would seem equal to her taste buds (if not sweeter with sucking).  I don't think i did a good job due to head injury plus I'm not a food scientist., and this is something i want to explain well.  Google has not been helpful. \ud83e\udd2c  SO: If you *know for sure* i am wrong i need to know..  But if i am right about tricking your taste buds to think there is more sugar, i would love to know    that i am right i would appreciate an explanation for a 6 yo  **I would love to do a science - learning experience with her,**but the only thing i can think of is demonstrating it via the lolipop explanation, only using a jelly bean...  Maybe have a 1/4 tsp of powder sugar vs 1/4 tsp regular sugar?   Or putting some sugar in two different substances (but i have to then explain it in a simple way & I dont know what two things i should put it in).  She is very smart & loves experiments.

                "content": " Yes, most definitely.  A really minimalist but effective basis is the famous Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat cookbook and show from one of the chefs that came up in Alice Water's fine restaurant. More comprehensive books would be The Food Lab, How to Cook Everything, and On Food and Cooking.  Here's my own personal theoretical framework, as a moderately skillful home cook that has cooked things that occasionally get praise like \"I dreamed about that dish for several nights\". It's just a hodge podge of what I've picked up, predominantly focused on learning from people like Kenji Alt-Lopez, Harold McGee, Herve This and similar.  Taste is on your tongue. Flavor is in your nose. Your brain combines these into a unified sensation, where texture and appearance matter substantially as well.  Taste is: salty, sour, sweet, bitter, umami.  Flavor is countless volatile organic compounds.  To some extent tastes balance each other. Increasing saltiness and sourness at the same time doesn't taste overly sour or overly salty, just more intensely delicious. Good recipes know what they're trying to target on the 5 tastes and use ingredients in a way that allows you to amplify and balance.  Flavor is more open ended, and where you can go nuts riffing your own ideas.  Besides this, there are a handful of simple physical facts that make a profound difference in your understanding of what you're cooking.  What we commonly call browning is a complex chain of things called the Maillard reaction. This is essential to building flavor in many if not most savory dishes. It's also what makes bread taste delicious even though raw flour is basically inedible. While the reaction begins happening at lower temperatures, 350F is the inflection point of where it starts happening rapidly. As a simple example of how useful this fact is: you can quite easily get a roast turkey to have great crispy skin as well as juicy interior. Use a thermometer to understand where the interior is at. Use your eyes, nose, and scraping with a utensil to understand where the skin is at. If the skin is browning faster than the interior is coming up to temp, back your oven down to 325F or lower. If the interior is getting mostly there but the skin is looking lackluster crank it up to 425F or use the broiler.  A very simple but important related fact is that a liquid mixture will not, on the average, rise above the boiling point of the liquid. You can boil broccoli all day and it won't brown. Put it in the oven and you get something entirely different.  Likewise, collagen, the connective tissue in meat begins decomposing into gelatin around 160F if it's in a moist environment. Again this is an inflection point, and there's a bit of that at lower temps. Fat begins to render (liquify) at around 130F, depending on the specific fat. Proteins denature (read as, go from translucent to opaque, and shrink in the direction of the fibers) at temps above 110F. These facts combine to tell you how to cook nearly any meat properly. Cuts of meat high in collagen should be cooked via moist cooking methods, and taken to fairly high temperatures to allow the fat and collagen to turn into a gelatin that coats the meat fibers. Compared to a steak the meat is way past well done, but the mentioned processes compensate for this producing that utterly tender fall apart texture of stews and great BBQ. Conversely, lean cuts should be handled carefully to avoid overcooking, at which point you'll have all the tight overcooked protein fibers and nothing to compensate for it.  Lastly, you can look at mirepoix, sofrito (of all it's variations across the med and americas), the cajun trinity, etc and see these are all the same fundamental idea and purpose, just a different flavor combination. Same for how a roux is commonly used to provide both flavor and thickening. Once you start seeing these big picture patterns across different culinary traditions, you can improvise your own things that hit the same notes of flavor and mental association (though do not ignore where specific traditions diverge).  Past that it's about learning technique, and how the results of choices in technique generalize. A great example is garlic. Whole vs sliced vs diced vs crushed produce different balances of sweet vs sharply sulfuric flavor. How long you cook garlic, onion, or similar things changes the balance of sharp vs caramelized sweet flavors.  Anyhow, that's a bit of a ranty brain dump, but reflects the big anchor ideas in how I approach cooking. I don't bill myself as a skilled chef. I am good enough to cook food on a regular basis that makes people literally do a double take. It's very near the top of my list of most satisfying things I've learned how to do."

I think this was largely so good because the recipes were sourced from interviews with top chefs. The posole and jambalaya are still two of my all-time favorite recipes to make. * Amazing Ribs \\- kinda specialized, but good at what it is. I don't actually grill but I use this site as a good baseline to make any type of BBQ food in the oven/stovetop. * Rick Bayless / Diana Kennedy - Mexican is my favorite cuisine to cook. Many of these recipes are too hard to scale down or too difficult to source the ingredients, but the ones I can do, I've really enjoyed. * Serious Eats - I find that Serious Eats can actually be pretty hit or miss, with a lot of great recipes but also many that add complexity for no reason (I don't think the fish sauce and orange juice actually improves Kenji's chili recipes, for example). But it's often a great starting point.  Does anyone have recommendations? I'm open to cookbooks, too.

My Family owns a farm in Alabama and we produce crops year round. One of the problems we run into is waste. I hate waste. I've turned waste at our farmer's market into food donations (Jimmy Hale Mission, various smaller church groups, feed for local pig farmers etc...) and compost for our farm ( pea hulls, past expiration produce etc...) This is beneficial for the wholesale produce business because we are located in the central hub of our state with lots of resources.      .   What I would like to do for my family this year is to negate waste at our farm. Being a farm we don't have the same access to outings as our wholesale business,but what we do have access to is a canning facility. The local government has provided a place were farmers can come and use the kitchens to \"process\" produce into preserved food, or pies or whatever their imagination allows.      .    I have a few farm hands with some outstanding recipes for salsa, pickled(everything) seriously some of the best tasting canned stuff I've ever eaten. However they are farm hands, not professional recipe developers. What I would like to do is hire a culinary student to help us develop recipes, methods, techniques in order to turn what would be waste at our farm ( misshaped veggies, excess supply, rejected orders...) into a line of products that people will be able to enjoy. The produce is still fresh, high in nutrition, and other wise perfectly edible but sometimes it doesn't meet the pretty requirements for people to buy in a grocery store or at their local curb market.    My questions:  * Obviously what am I missing?    * How much should we pay a student or graduate to develop recipes, techniques, methods so we can get our line rolling? This will be part time work to train the locals to run the operation. It will be summer work, and I know students could really use the experience and cash so I would like to use them, but please advice me otherwise if this isn't the best idea.    * Has anyone developed a line of syrups, jams, jellies, dressings etc and is willing to offering advice?   I really love this community, and thank you for you advice!\n\nAssistant:"

It can be someone young but they will need to have some serious skills and knowledge to develop a canning process for you. Getting it wrong will waste product, time, and money.   You're essentially talking about getting into food processing so you have to nail down the regulatory details as well so you don't run afoul of the FDA or local health departments. You may need a HACCP plan, preventative controls, etc. A student can't write those for you.    EDIT: I thought of something else. Consider seeking the part time services of a retired process control specialist. Depending on where you are you might find one willing to help you out at a reasonable price. If they're a consultant, forget it, you will pay a huge sum. But if they're just retired and willing to work a few hours a week to help you get some products running then you might be able to make it work financially."

I know that ideally, each vegetable has a different  temperature, roasting time, and possible pre-cooking method to really get a great flavor, texture, etc from roasting. But if you're mixing a bunch of different vegetables together, you can't really capitalize on this easily. So, what are good ways to get them to be nicely cooked and flavorful?  Some things I'm wondering specifically:  * How do you determine a good roasting temperature and time when you have a mixture of root vegetables (which I've read should roast low and slow) and more moist vegetables (which I've read should go high and fast)? I figure I could roast the root ones first and then add the moist ones and turn up the heat, but if it could be even simpler than that, that would be great. * When you're seasoning with herbs, they can go in from the beginning, right? But if you're using spices (turmeric, cumin, fennel, coriander, etc) are those better toward the end so they don't burn? * Is it better to salt first to draw out moisture? Or salt after? * When using things like garlic, ginger, scallions, and shallots, is it better to add them only for a short while at the end so they don't burn? Or just cut them larger? * I've seen some methods cover the pan until about the last 10-15 minutes of cooking, and then remove the cover. What benefit does this have?  If it helps, some of my favorite vegetables include carrots, beets, sweet potato, parsnips, squash, bell peppers, zucchini, leeks, chard, spinach, bok choy, green beans, and broccoli.  Also, I figure that some of the answers will vary based on taste and preference, but I'm just interested in hearing about what people know and what you've experienced so that I can guide my own experimenting.\n\nAssistant:"

I miss Mexican food, Creole food, and some good ol' Western food. What's open to me using a Chinese kitchen and Chinese ingredients? I'd rather stay away from imported goods whenever I can.  They're quite pricey.  **Chinese kitchen**:  - Flames on the stove are crazy hot.  Cooking something like a steak, or even a chicken breast or a pork chop, is quite tough without messing up ('medium-high' to 'high' would be the lowest setting on a Chinese stove, and then there's only one tiny flame in the center).  - No oven.  We have a little toaster oven, which is good for melting cheese and making toast... not much else. Temperature is hard to control, basically impossible to roast stuff.  **Chinese market**:  - In this area of the country (Shenzhen, Guangdong), the quality of beef is pretty terrible unless you're paying a hefty premium.  Lamb is almost non-existent.  Pork and Chicken are cheap and plentiful.  - Seafood is awesome.  Fish are of the regional variety, and there's always tons of crab, shrimp, and crayfish.  Can go to the market and get it live.  - Fruits and veggies depend on what's in season.  Okra, for example, is available but only for a brief period in the summer.  **Ingredients in Western Food that's Available:**  - I got a pretty good selection of dried herbs and spices: Bay Leaf, Parsley, Rosemary, Thyme, Basil, Dill, Garlic Salt, Garlic Powder, Cayenne Pepper, Chili Powder, Fennel Seeds, Cinnamon, Paprika, Nutmeg, Tumeric, Mustard Seed, Black Pepper    - Fresh Herbs: Cilantro, Parsley, Lemon Grass  - Sauces: Hot Sauce, Tabasco, Worcestershire Sauce, Mustards, Mayo  - Dairy: Butter, Milk, American Cheese   As for oil, olive oil's available but crazy expensive so I'd rather stay away.

I have a very close family member, female aged 31, I was actually their maid of honor at their wedding, who I am starting to have serious questions about. She has a history of lying/manipulating but obviously no one expects someone to lie about something so serious. Here is the timeline :  February 2014 she told me she had cancer- Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, that the doctors were just keeping an eye on it. She was engaged at this point and left her fiance, left her kids with my mom, and started travelling and dating a coworker. Her children still live with my parents. She said she had to have a full hysterectomy to make sure she didn't get pregnant again, but she had it done out of state.  Summer 2014 she said the doctors had missed something and that it was actually Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia and that she only had 6 months to live. She cut her hair really short, started exercising pretty intensely. Said she didn't want to do treatment because she would rather just travel.  Early 2015 she was travelling nearby and came to visit for one day. I wasn't able to spend any time with her now fiance because she had him stay in a hotel while she stayed at my house. She had a syringe and some medicine that was in a tupperware container she said was a clinical trial she was apart of. She also walked with a limp- like her leg was really stiff- she said that is where the cancer was concentrated. Summer 2015: She and her fiance decide to get married. I sobbed the entire time. She was smoking a lot of pot and using cannabis oil, which she claimed was helping her like beat the cancer. She was also juicing, working out a lot, and just trying to be really healthy. She was still smoking and drinking also, but I figured if she had months to live I wasn't going to stop her.  Early 2016: She was still defying odds at this point for me. She and her husband visited, she had an awful cold which I think was from being so sick. On their way back home (a few states over) they stopped somewhere because she was so sick that she had to go to the hospital. Said the cancer had spread to her kidneys, stomach, colon, and lungs.  2016: Basically the entire year she would dodge questions if I asked, would say she was thinking about getting treatment, was living in a different state every 2 months but said her doctors were transferring her stuff to new doctors when she moved. She works in mines and as a pipe fitter and has to work to keep insurance. She had a full body mri and cat scan in september and said the leukemia was pre b cell.  2017. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in addition to the ALL. She said she was doing chemotherapy in February, then a bone marrow transplant, then more chemotrherapy. I offered to fly up and to be a bone marrow donor because I am registrered and we are the same blood type, but she didn't want anyone there. She had to get some dental work done before they would start the chemotherapy. In November, she had some kind of surgery- I think to remove her ovaries. She is also really hard to get details out of and I have no way of talking to her fiance for information. My sister, who is an ARNP, accused her of faking at this point. She sent a photo of her medication as proof that she wasn't lying-- Ondansettron, clindamyacin, amitriptyline, triamcinolone, and a bunch of supplements. My sister didn't believe her and cut off all contact. In mid 2017 she said they found a 3 inch mass in her breast.  2018: She had radiation treatment that ended in February. She said they did a full body scan the week after her treatment ended and she was cancer free and that her leukemia is in partial remission, that it is inactive right now and they dont think it will reactivate for at least a few years. She said she had brachterapy for 3 months.   Is there any way this is all true? If you have any questions, please let me know. I am just in such a state of shock.\n\nAssistant:"

The hair tested was dated between 10/31/2018 and 07/31/2019.

If you can see what is obstructing the airway, lay the person down, arms to the sides, and sweep it out with a finger. First response should be the Heimlich maneuver.   To do this place your hands around the person in a ball shape at the stomach. When you push into their stomach, be sure to move the direction of your fist in a curved upward motion. If the person is too large that you cannot reach around properly, do this same motion at the chest. The same should be done if the person is pregnant.   If they become unresponsive, unable to breathe or unable to breathe normally, perform CPR. Go to their side, check their pulse at the neck on your side, if no pulse is found within 10 seconds, begin CPR immediately.   To perform CPR correctly, place your hands, one on top of each other, on the breastbone. Square yourself over the body, use the heel of your hand to press down 2\u201d for any person over 8 years old. Try to keep the most even rhythms possible, repeating compressions at a pace of 100 to 120 per minute. Make sure the chest rises back up before pressing back down.   If the person is an infant, cradle them on your forearm facedown, use the hand to support the head and a leg hanging to each side of your forearm. Have the head slightly lower than the rest of the body. Deliver five back blows to the infant using the heel of your hand in the upper back area between the shoulder blades. If the infant doesn\u2019t spit out the obstruction, sandwich your other hand over the child and flip. Perform chest thrusts between the nipples with two fingers. Only go 1.5\u201d deep for an infant. Make sure the chest rises back up before pressing back down. Do five thrusts before flipping back over for back blows.   Obviously this is ideally performed by someone certified but if you cannot have official training, try to best familiarize yourself with these procedures.

Weight: 1lb 10oz at birth, now 3lbs  Meds: Fentanyl & Lasix  He has yet to properly poop. He had a few MLs of breastmilk in his first few days of life but stopped when the first bowel movement never came. He's been on TPN only ever since.  He had necrotizing entercolitis by 2 weeks old that caused a perforation in his large intestine. They surgically repaired it and created stomas for an ostomy. He's never had more than a few poop smears and tiny \"seeds\" come out. A week ago he passed a meconium plug out of his bum.  Now for the past few days his belly has become distended. They did a contrast&xray study that didn't show any blockages so they don't think an exploratory surgery would help. They are putting a medicine (I'm not sure the name at the moment) into his stoma to try to break up whatever might be in there and get things moving. That was started almost 24 hours ago and hasn't worked yet. They were previously just trying saline. They've also started an antibiotic in case the belly distention is another infection. So far the 24 hour culture result looks good, waiting on 48 hour.  He's been on a ventilator since birth and we can't feed him or start a course of steroids for his lungs until he poops. We really have to just keep waiting? This isn't normal even for a micropreemie, right?  What questions should I be asking his care team? Is there something we are missing you can think of? Thanks so much. I'm extremely worried.\n\nAssistant:"

You may PM me with this info, if you are not comfortable with saying out here. * How much bowel did he lose?  * Specifically how old was he when he first was diagnosed with NEC?  * Does he have \"bowel sweat\", meaning liquid that seeps out of the stoma but is not stool?   * When was his last surgery?  * Why did they tell you they could not give him steroids?   * What kind of ventilator settings is he on, if you know?  * Did he have an infection at birth?   * How many doses of surfactant did he receive?   * To confirm, he's never been extubated, correct?   * Does he have a PDA/how large?  Have they tried closing it, and with what?  Why did he deliver early (maternal vs baby reason?)  No, this is not normal, by a long shot, for a micropreemie.  I am also extremely concerned about a lot of different factors, but his lungs and gut are pretty darn high on that list.  I am guessing that they are putting mucomyst in the stoma to try and break up anything in there, but I'm concerned for why he needs that.

These can be sudden in onset, people often state they feel they are going to die or develop a feeling of impending doom (you mention this). The symptoms with these can be racing heartbeat, profuse sweating, tingling to fingers and toes, feeling of loss of control, nausea, dizziness, etc. They can feel like they last an eternity although most are only a few minutes and the nausea can persist for a while after. This is what it sounds like, and can be caused by stressful situations or a number of physical maladies as well (although this is less likely). Low blood sugar, hypothyroidism, etc can cause it.   Some people mention vasovagal response. This, in my opinion, is a possibility but less likely. In those situations, most get lightheaded, have narrowed vision, can get dizzy but this isn't the predominate symptom, and feel they are going to (or do) black out. This can happen with physical injuries, which is why I still consider it a possibility. If you happened to hit the foot or in some people cases were thinking intently about the injury, it could cause a vasovagal response.   Other possibilities are causes of vertigo; migraine, abrupt position changes, infection; etc. This seems less likely.   In the end, it's hard to tell what exactly it is.

When I talked to the surgeon, he indicated the coroner would give us the final answer, but then signed off on \"no autopsy\" without telling me. Then lost the body for days. I'm not sure what details are most important here, so I'll try to sum things up clearly. I need to determine if I should pay for a private autopsy, the problem is money is tight. However, if it's likely someone messed up, I want to take action. This hospital has something of a reputation when it comes to problems with infections, and previously they messed up on a friend of mine, their mistake nearly led to the amputation of her arm. Luckily that time they caught their mistake, and the $250,000 medical bill wasn't placed on my friend.      Male     66     5'10\"     215 lb     had been on 5mg oxycontin for a bruised rib, took something like 30mg total a day      Rough timeline:  * Day 1 he went to the ER for an infected toe. They referred him to another ER because the infection had spread to the bone and they needed to amputate. His GP said he had no diabetes. He may have had a case of bronchitis.  * Day 2 he's dealing with bad conditions at the hospital where his surgery will take place due to overcrowding in the non-covid section of the hospital while they give him antibiotics prior to surgery.  * Day 3 surgery takes place, surgeon reports everything went quickly and smoothly. Dad texts me after, saying everything went well. I talked with him and he sounded tired, but didn't seem out of the ordinary post-op.  * ~14 hours later, a nurse says he was talking with my dad, he was joking with the nurse and the nurse \"got his pain level down\" and continued his rounds. An hour after this, my dad starts to gasp for breath, starts coding and they move him to the cardiology section where he passed.  Some possible weirdness:  The surgeon led me to believe there would be an autopsy, though he never directly stated there would be one, as he said my dad was relatively young and the surgeon didn't know what could have gone wrong. However, the surgeon had either already signed off on no-autopsy or did shortly thereafter. Going back to our conversation, the surgeon never said \"there will be an autopsy\" he just said \"the coroner will have to tell us what happened\" or something along those lines.  I waited for a couple of days to hear back the results, but the hospital then lost my dad and the stuff he had brought in with him, they lost him for something like 4 or 5 days, with us calling every day after the 2nd day after his passing trying to find him and his phone so we could get his contacts and notify people. We still don't have his phone, so we haven't been able to notify all of his friends as the majority of their contact info is in his phone and we don't have it yet.\n\nAssistant:"

All the following assumes you live in the US:   I believe the specifics varies by state/county, but any unexpected death (with or without surgery) is by default a coroner's case.   This means, someone at the hospital (doctor or nurse) is legally obligated to call the county coroner and report the death.  The coroner has the discretion to order an autopsy, i.e. say yes or no they believe one should be done.  In this situation, I would think they definitely would, and the body would be transferred to the coroner's office to do it.  Even if the coroner says no, they don't require one, the attending doc of the patient can request an autopsy (to be done by the hospital.)  I guess in your shoes I would do the following:    Contact the surgeon and ask if the case was reported to the coroner.  If not, why not.  If they did call, what did they say about an autopsy.       Then ask how you go about arranging a private autopsy.  The surgeon might not know, but should be able to get you in contact with people in the hospital who can help you find out.     Any respectable surgeon would want to know what happened just as much as you do.    If you find him being evasive on the subject or refusing to return your calls, contact the hospital administration.  Admins know medical legal risk and this is absolutely a red flag in that regard."

After stopping I developed MGD, IBS, brain fog, floaters; career ruined feel awful. Hello docs,  I took isotretinoin (I believe it was absorica) at age 18 in 2013, was reassured by doctor that it was quite safe and side effects are temporary, to notify him if serious/life-threatening issues arose.   The course of the medication:  mo. 1: 40mg - dry lips + a little dry skin  mo. 2: 40mg - dry lips + drier skin  mo. 3: 50mg - dry lips + skin, joints aching, knees sore  mo. 4: 40mg - knees still sore, eyes a bit try (used eye drops)  My doctor wasn't worried about the side effects at all, my blood results were all good and normal, but the side effects bothered me so I quit. 2 weeks after quitting joint aches went away, but my eyes became incredibly dry (couldn't look at a computer for longer than a few minutes without severe burning pain).  Eyes progressively got worse, then afterwards (a month or so), I developed IBS.  Around the same time, my eyes developed awful floaters everywhere :( Nothing looks the same, it's awful. I also started noticing that I have a horrible memory and I struggle badly with brain fog.  Due to memory loss + dry eyes, I had to change my career. I've been diagnosed with MGD (meibomian gland dysfunction), a permanent and progressive degenerative condition of the glands in the eyes. None of this runs in my familial history at all and I didn't have any of these issues before I stopped the drug.  Now almost 6 years later I am still dealing with all this damage that only seems to be getting worse! Severely affecting my ability to have any kind of quality of life. I feel awful all the time with pain and this damage is just horrible.  Here's some medical info:  Age: 23  G: Male, race: caucasian  Blood pressure: 132/84, heart rate: 80  All blood tests are within normal ranges, tested for autoimmune markers, all normal. I've seen an ophthalmologist, a neurologist, psychiatrists, a GI doc, and my GP. When I went back to tell my original dermatologist that I developed IBS, eye issues, and brain fog AFTER accutane he said it was 'just a coincidence' and he didn't think it was related to the drug!  Yet after joining a facebook group and talking to other people (a couple have posted here asking about it) so many other patients have the same issue!  ***TL;DR:*** So, my question is, I have all these horrible life-ruining damaging effects that started after I stopped taking accutane, my dermatologist says they are unrelated but I was perfectly healthy before. What causes these post-accutane effects to start after you're not even taking the drug? Why are more doctors not taking this seriously and telling you that the side effects can happen not just during, but also after you stop it?   Thank you!\n\nAssistant:"

NETs+Syndrome.  I realize this might be against the rules since it is not a question but I felt I should share. Sorry mods if this is not acceptable and remove if necessary. ______  Several years back I made a few posts on r/AskDocs aka \"Ask A Doctor\" looking for help with symptoms that had been getting progressively worse for a few years. They were quite detailed and each time I got a little bit of basic advice and suggestions but nothing that helped resolve or figure out the issues. I delayed going to a doctor and then even when I did, I downplayed the symptoms.  I deleted most of the posts for privacy reasons after advice was sought and received but the last one I posted remains (it got no responses and was specifically about flushing and did not contain some of the other symptoms so I didn't think to delete it)...   https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/69w3ai/flushing_tingling_of_face_and_body_help_please/  It is not the best representation of the help I was seeking but I figured I would link it.  ____  I finally sought help from a specialist a few months after that and after plenty of testing and multiple referrals, I was diagnosed with Stage IV Neuroendocrine cancer and Severe Carcinoid Syndrome. It was bad enough progressed that I was told by the doctor team and surgeons who initially treated me after the diagnosis, that they were shocked at my condition and were surprised I had not had either a heart attack or liver failure yet. One doctor even stated that if I had kept going without seeking help I would have been dead within 6 months for sure.  While the situation is far from resolved (I have gone through multiple surgeries and treatments since) and while there is no cure or resolution currently, I am now way better off than I was before and am a research patient contributing to cancer research for young Neuroendocrine patients. I may be dealing with this the rest of my life but I am alive and contributing to research that may help others.  ____  I post this because I want to make it clear that /r/AskDocs is great as a sounding board and to get general advice but it is no substitute for actually seeing doctors and pushing for help. One of my first posts someone stated that I should push my doctors on the matter if I was that concerned. I wish I had done exactly that sooner. Instead, I kept seeking advice on r/AskDocs, and downplaying my situation in the real world.  I read a lot of posts on this subreddit and often see people seemingly dismissing going to an actual doctor or stating they don't think it is helpful and expecting the subreddit to figure out their problem. If you do not trust your doctor find a new one, but please folks, SEE A REAL DOCTOR FOR YOUR ISSUES. And PLEASE communicate fully and don't downplay things. This subreddit may help you get ideas for questions, and maybe even find possible solutions, but it is NOT a substitute for a real doctor.   Take my case as an example. I delayed and delayed, and kept posting on this subreddit hoping for answers and while I did see real doctors, I did not push my situation or give as much detail as I should have. I downplayed it and figured that if no one on /r/AskDocs seemed to know what it was, it probably was not serious.  How wrong I was.\n\nAssistant:"

Hello,  Firstly, I had no idea I was allergic to wasps. no other known allergies to anything. Very healthy, 32 year old non-smoking female, living in Florida. I got stung 3 times by a wasp on Friday (72 hours ago) while doing yard work. Whole nine yards: my entire body came up in hives (down throat, face, chest, arms, stomach, legs), I couldn't breathe, was taken to ER by paramedics who confirmed my airway/ tongue was severely swollen. Had 1 epipen in ambulance, 2 epipens in ER. They sent anesthesiologist to begin intubation, but then my airway opened. Had a recurrence the next day (Saturday) 19 hours later (hives, throat/ tongue swelling)-further 3 epipens delivered. Again, they sent intubation team but my throat hadn't actually closed, which was a relief. Sunday went by with some hives, but nothing major. Today (Monday) I was released from ICU onto a general ward at 10am. Discharged at 4pm with 20mg prednisone and Bendryl. Have to schedule emergency referral with immunologist which of course I'm making a priority.  Back at my house tonight I was eating dinner. Hives came up, I got shaky and hot. I took my steroids/ Bendryl and tried to stay clam. But I'm worried a huge reaction will occur again and shut my throat again. Is this likely?  I don't understand why I'm still getting symptoms over 72 hours after the initial stings that caused the anaphylaxis. Admittedly my airway is fine ( a tiny bit tight but nothing like that awful closing feeling), but of course any slight twinge with my throat and I start convincing myself it will shut suddenly.  I'd love some advice on this. Trying to stay calm, but I'm just so scared my throat will close off in my sleep or something. Is it usual for these symptoms to continue for so long after the initial attack? Will they ever stop?  I don't normally even worry about my health but this was a horrible shock. Thanks for any help.  :-)  P. S. I know this is not the worst medical problem. Sorry if I seem selfish asking all these questions. I just need some expert input and it's quite hard getting hold of an immunologist/ allergist by official channels at this time of night!!!\n\nAssistant:"

It is, after all, a toxin designed to incapacitate or kill.   The only way our bodies can neutralize these is by mounting an immune response to neutralize the venom. So you will feel run-down almost flu-like for the next few weeks. During this time, there will be amounts of venom in your system. The amount varies obviously according to 1. species 2. site of envenomation 3. host response (you).   The 3rd point is important as it depends upon your own immune system as to what responses occur. Ectopic people, who have allergies against seemingly everything, may have nasty recurring episodes as their immune system cranks up into overdrive.   Do be aware that you have effectively now \"primed\" your immune system to this sort of venom, and thus with a subsequent exposure, it could trigger an even more powerful response. Yes, this is how vaccines work, but we control what the body reacts to. These venoms can trigger all sorts of cross-reactivities, so be vigilant (not paranoid!).    Steroids are first-line to control and modulate your immune response, antihistamines to ease the symptoms and adrenaline is your last-ditch-buy-me-20-minutes-to-ER lifeline.   EpiPen is NOT a curative drug.   You dose yourself, then GET TO EMERGENCY, not continue with your day. Let me stress again, it is ***NOT*** curative, it buys you *time* to get to definitive care.   From the sounds of it, you may have a rough few weeks ahead of you. You should set up a support and management plan. Let people who are around you know of the situation, and what signs to look for. Let them know that its possible you may need to be hospitalized."

A few days before quarantine began, I decided to sort of  experiment a bit with my sexuality instead of just being bi curious, and hooked up with a guy on grindr. I was really nervous and we decided to just go slow with him giving me oral. I asked him several times before we got together whether he was STD free and he told me yes multiple times,.

Ive basically cried my eyes out and been stuck in a huge depression.

                "content": " I\u2019m sorry this happened to you.   It was not stupid or reckless. You took precautions, asked about STI status and used protection. The person lied and that is a serious breach of trust and that is not on you.   Using a condom greatly reduces your chances of infection. The scenario you described would have a very low chance of transmission. In addition, there is no way to know, but if this person was in treatment and treatment was effective they might have a suppressed viral load, which means that changes of passing it on to another person are basically zero.   It is very very unlikely that you have HIV. However, I urge you to get tested for your own peace of mind. I know it might seem to you preferable not to know but knowing your status can only empower you to make decisions about what\u2019s best for you. If you are negative then you can stop feeling anxious and stressed about your status. If you are positive you can start treatment and with proper treatment you can expect to live a full life. Testing for HIV is more likely to be accurate 3 months after exposure and it sounds like that is the case for you, so try to get tested as soon as possible. If less time has passed you can still try to get tested but let your doctor know about this exposure and follow their recommendations.   This does not mean you should not have explored your sexuality. There are several things you can do to be more protected. The obvious is having sex with a partner that agrees to get tested for STIs with you. Going to the STI clinic together might not seem like a very sexy first date but I think it would give you the peace of mind to be able to enjoy the experience later.   There is also something called PrEP or pre-exposure prophylaxis. It is a medicine people take if they believe there is a chance they could be exposed to HIV. Basically you take this medicine daily and if you are later exposed to HIV, having taken it greatly lowers your risk of contracting HIV. It would be a way for you to explore your sexuality with even more peace of mind. You should still use condoms as this does not protect against other STIs and is not 100% effective but it is very helpful.   There is also something called post-exposure prophylaxis. It is a combination of medicines you take after you have been exposed to HIV. Taking these meds right after the exposure greatly protects you from becoming infected with HIV. The sooner after the exposure you start this the more likely it is to work.   Good luck."

The fact that I\u2019m so young with osteoporosis is another story.   Anyways, I\u2019ve gone to my male endocrinologist twice now. Both times he has made me feel slightly uncomfortable. He gets very close when talking to me. Has complimented my hair, called me a young beautiful woman. And both visits he has had me stand up while he runs his hands down the sides of my body along my hips and thighs, he takes the side of his hand and pushes between my boobs, etc.   I would just like to ask if this is normal for an endocrinologist? I mean I like to think the closeness and compliments are to make him more personable. And with feeling my body he is trying to feel my bone structure to make sure I\u2019m healthy. But I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to be naive. Typing this out makes it sound very creepy.   Any endocrinologists out there that can comment or people who have experienced the same?\n\nAssistant:"

I think he is physically molesting you and passing it off as a physical assessment.   Does he have a chaperone (another person, usually a nurse) in the room when he examines you? This is standard practice when doing any kind of intimate examination. I would never touch a patient\u2019s thighs (especially not a younger female patient\u2019s thighs as a male doctor) without having a chaperone present.   Find a different endocrinologist- ask you GP to re-refer you. I would also advise that you report this doctor - he may be doing this to other patients, and may do worse in the future if he is not stopped. Your GP can help with this.   Sorry that you have had this experience, the trust between patient and doctor is very important. Abusing this trust is a very serious issue."

He made it and is still alive and in good spirits 6 days later. Can someone help me understand? Hi all. My father in law has been sick recently and was sent home on hospice. He has diabetes and about a month ago had a leg amputated above the knee. He has osteomyelitis, pneumonia, MDRO, UTI, and 50% injection rate after a mild heart attack (2 months ago). Last week he was transferred to the ICU from a rehab facility. He was on a ventilator and receiving dialysis daily. He was on a few blood pressure medications and 2-3 antibiotics for his multiple infections. They told us that the prognosis was not good and recommended hospice. Our goal was to get him home to pass with family surrounding him. They doctors had told us that they tried to take him off of the vent the day before and he couldn\u2019t tolerate it longer than an hour. They were saying that there was a good chance that he would not be able to make it through the transport home because he couldn\u2019t be transported without the vent. So on Friday they took him off of the vent and he made it home. Once home they took him off of IV Levophed. They were expecting him to pass shortly after. However this didn\u2019t happen.   Now, 6 days later, he is still alive and in good spirits. He has refused any pain medication and says he doesn\u2019t have any pain. His lungs still sound really bad and he\u2019s requiring frequent suction because he\u2019s coughing up a lot. His o2 saturation has been in the upper 90s. His BP and heart rate are low (couldn\u2019t give you exact readings).   I\u2019m just confused about all of this. They weren\u2019t expecting him to even make it home. He made it and he\u2019s still alive 6 days later. I understand that he is most likely going to pass soon. I\u2019m not in denial about that. I\u2019m just confused as to why he has lasted this long. He was requiring dialysis daily. I figured after a few days he would have passed. I feel almost guilty like we should have waited before making the choice to take him home on hospice. I feel like he might have had a chance for even a slight improvement to give him more time. I guess what I\u2019m trying to understand is, they told us he was in critical condition and was going to die very very soon, as in most likely the same day he gets home. Is the fact that he\u2019s still alive indicative of any improvement or proof that he wasn\u2019t as sick as they thought he was? This has all thrown us on a rollercoaster of emotions and I think the guilt is setting in for all of us.\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " I'm a hospice nurse.  We see these kinds of situations all the time.  The criteria to qualify for hospice is not that the patient is expected to die immediately (and, frankly, at that point it really defeats the purpose of hospice), but that, if the patient's disease runs it's expected course, the patient likely has 6 months or less left to live. It doesn't mean that the patient will definitely die in six months, but it's based on the referring physician's medical judgment.   Patients come home on hospice and the idea is that we try to make the most of the time they have left, as well as managing any symptoms they have.  Oftentimes, a patient's routine medications that are not helping symptom-wise are discontinued.  Many times, patients feel better after stopping some meds that can have uncomfortable side effects.  We also work with a hospice pharmacist to treat symptoms and the medications we use can greatly improve a patient's overall well-being. Sometimes patients feel better just getting out of the hospital and being at home with family.    We currently have some patients who have been on hospice for more than a year.  We've had patients in the past who have done so well that they've been discharged from hospice.    It sounds to me like your situation is one where the medical team had determined there really isn't anything more they can do to try treat/cure the underlying illness so they recommended that he go home and be made as comfortable as possible. Of course, specific questions should be directed to the treating physicians but your hospice nurses are also a good resource for answers as to what his current condition is.   I'm sorry your family is going through this. I encourage you to talk to the hospice team, they will be working to make the most of the time your loved one has left."

The only thing they found that was out of the normal, other than ground glass opacity in her lungs, was that her intestines were full of fecal matter, even though she had normal bowel movements 4 times that day before going to the hospital.\u00a0  We followed up after the hospital with her primary. All the doc said was that it sounded allergic or viral. I asked if she should get tested for vitamin and mineral deficiencies. We're vegan, as I told them. I wanted to see if she was anemic, b12 deficiency, maybe some other imbalance. They reluctantly humored me. She showed marginally low iron, and low vitamin c.\u00a0 I got her suppliments, but neither was hugely out of range and she still feels abnormal and weak. She feels nauseous, shaky, fatigued. She said it feels like her stomach quivers when she tries to eat.\u00a0  I don't feel like the docs are taking her concern very seriously, because shes a heavy person. They continue to mention poor diet. She does NOT have a poor diet. She has a crafted, tracked, and measured food program that she has been training with for 4 years.\u00a0  I'm at a loss for how to help her, but if we can't figure it out, it's going to ruin her training and competitions.\u00a0 Any advice would be extremely helpful and appreciated.\n\nAssistant:"

And the answer to that is unknown. What he has going for him is that he is young and has no other medical conditions but that's it. Otherwise he has a part of his brain, which we don't know unless we had his medical records, that is affected. I'm not a neurologist, but the brain is complex and it's difficult to assess in any case. Only time will tell and possibilities include that he may have lost his cerebral function, but his brain stem might be intact and that's why he is still breathing, heart pumping etc.  But all in all, we can't give you any more insight or advice other than watch and wait.

This is really just a question I never thought to bring here until right now, when my phone decided a news byte I needed was someone growing hair out of their gums.  Which reminded me of something that happened ages ago that I've never found an answer for.  When I was a kid, a hair fucking grew out of my tongue.  Towards the back, too far for me to really reach.  I discovered it when it got tugged by my back teeth.  Screamed my head off; still remember how much it hurt.  My grandparents were watching me at the time and they were just like \"...what the fuck is this child's damage?\"  I reached far back enough to try and feel around, and the end broke off (you know how it does when you use tweezers, and you don't get the root, but the hair breaks off?) just a bit, but enough to confirm that yes, this was a hair.  However, I realized that convincing people that there was a hair growing out of my fucking tongue was going to be an uphill battle, so I resolved to deal with it.  I have no memory of what happened after that, but I assume it didn't bother me again because I surely would've lost my resolve if it had; the pain was intense.  I also remember the explanation I came up with as a kid: I must have eaten something that cut my tongue and somehow it scabbed over and trapped a hair I'd accidentally gotten in my mouth.  In hindsight that seems only slightly more likely than a hair actually growing out of my tongue, but it was far less terrifying, so I went with it.  Except it happened again.  Not sure if it was when I was a teen or a young adult; old enough to take the pain of it without losing my shit, but long enough ago that I can't place it on any sort of timeline.  Same thing happened; enough of the end broke off that it stopped getting snagged and never bothered me again.  Honestly?  While I always remembered it, I'd assumed for a while that it was just one of those weird kid memories you eventually realize didn't actually happen.  Sure I could remember it clearly but I can also clearly remember things I know I'm not remembering correctly.  And hair just...doesn't grow out of the back of someone's tongue.  But the second time I was well past the age for that.  No matter how much I google, I only get results for the disgusting but irrelevant condition colloquially known as \"hairy tongue.\"  And one site that claims to have medical photos of hair growing out of tongues, but one looks photoshopped and the other one looks like a dog with stitches in its tongue.  And a lot of dream interpretation sites. I'm fully expecting any responses I get to accuse me of making shit up (to what end, I don't know) or misremembering, and I get it.  I'm just hoping someone here will say \"Oh I heard of that happening to a guy\" or whatever.   Hell, at this point I'll take \"Sometimes people with X disorder have vivid hallucinations of hair growing out of their tongue.\"    This has been bothering me for 30 years.\n\nAssistant:"

Age: 20f  Height: 5'7  Weight: Not sure. She is very thin.   Conditions: Depression, anxiety.  Medication: She takes Cymbalta. 20mg.  Symptoms (physical)  * Weight loss * Tremors/shakiness * Loss of bladder control  Symptoms (Mental)  * Spaciness (unaware of her surroundings, almost like she's going around in a daze) * Forgetfulness * Extreme sensitivity * Regressive like thoughts/actions (I know of no other way to describe it.)  I am posting out of concern for my daughter. Over the past year or so, I have watched her maturity seemingly decrease. She was always young at heart in the sense that she enjoyed certain childish things, but wouldn't solely depend on these, and had interests that were more \"her age\". In the last few months, she has not only denounced some of her old hobbies/interests, but can't even seem to grasp or comprehend what she used to be able to. For example, she used to be a speedy, comprehensive reader, sometimes being able to finish a good 300-page book in a day or two. Now, she struggles to even move from page to page, and has to re-read the same sentence over and over again. This has greatly affected her college. Her speech has become simple, scattered almost. She tells me that she doesn't remember the bigger words, which are really just the everyday words people use. The way that she describes her thoughts is forced. It takes a lot for her to put together a sentence, and sometimes it makes no sense (Ex. She uses a word that has a different meaning than what she's trying to say).   As far as her ability to care for herself goes, she is still pretty self-sufficient, but loses control of her bladder, when she used to always be in control of it before. Wets the bed sometimes (accidentally), and experiences a lot of leaks. Has started wanting to eat with her hands and drink exclusively out of straws/baby-like bottles (Water bottles that resemble that of a baby bottle where she only has to suck instead of sip/drink normally). Has become OBSESSED with stuffed animals and childlike items. This is very distressing for me as her mother to watch. It's like I'm watching my adult daughter go back to a childlike state. All of these things I have discovered throughout the months either unintentionally/accidentally, as she tries to do most of these in private. Some of these things such as her spaciness (especially regarding her school performance) she has told me herself, but I am now putting all of these symptoms together and starting to become worried. Is this a sign of some kind of neurological disorder? Could this be some other manifestation of her depression/anxiety? I've never heard of an adult regressing like this due to those illnesses, but I realize I am not very educated in mental illnesses or their effects. Please help me make sense of this, I feel like I'm slowly losing her.\n\nAssistant:"

When they woke me up in the office I was extremely belligerent and was thrashing around and screaming like crazy. When I got home I punched my husband in the face and tore apart our entire apartment in a fit of rage (I am NOT a ragey person). Then I passed out on the ground. Husband called 911. Paramedics brought me to hospital. I got 4 of narcan, no response. Smelling salts not much of a response. Then woke up lated and was belligerent again in the ER, refused to let them do head CT, I was screaming about being raped. I got admitted for observation. I woke up in the middle of the night, went to the bathroom, got dizzy and passed out again. They did head CT and it was normal. The next morning I had paranoid delusions, I was convinced the FBI was monitoring me and they were going to take away my daughter, paranoid the nurses were poisoning me, ect. I ran away from my room and it took them an hour to find me. Then they gave me olanzapine and I slept for like 20 hours straight. Woke up normal with very little memory of what happened. ....so my question is how the hell did general anesthesia do this to me?  I have been under general anesthesia about 5 times in the past for various procedures and this did not happen. I had another dental procedure 3 weeks prior with somewhat similar results. I did a root canal under moderate IV sedation and while I have no memory of it, the dentist told me I was fighting them the entire time, hence why we did general anesthesia for the second root canal. I do not have a history of violence other than during these two root canals.   These are the meds I was given according to the anesthesiologist: 15mg midazolam PO, Once IV was started, you got 150mcg fentanyl and 20mcg dexmedetomidine titrated, 150mg propofol for induction, You got another 100mg propofol after intubation because you were bucking on the tube, 10mg dexamethasone. Most of these meds between 1:07 to about 1:20. Sevoflurane maintenance until about 2:30 and toward the end I gave you another 25 mcg fentanyl and 15 mcg dexmedetomidine to do awake extubation, Along with 4mg ondansetron  I will need more dental work in the future but both of my experiences with anesthesia for dental treatment has been, well, horrific. Moving forward I'm terrified this will happen again. What could have caused this? What in anesthesia makes people go psychotic? How can I avoid this?\n\nAssistant:"

Please, if too complex for reddit, even a recommendation for what type of doctor I should be seeking as I have gone in circles. Tired of snake-oil recommendations and woo from friends, surely there has to be a logical answer.  **26, 118lbs, 5'5\",**  **female, non-smoking/drinking/recreational drugs. Take gabapentin 300mg for sleep/pain and lorazepam as needed for anxiety.**       **medical issues/hospitalizations/surgeries in rough timeline:**     * scoliosis - moderate * frequent URI/sinus infections/strep. * tonsils and adenoids removed, ethmoidectomy * multiple thyroid cysts, deemed benign * IBS * periorbital cellulitis - multi day hospitalization. Came out of the blue and rapidly. * endometriosis - laparoscopy & ablation/excision (lesions on colon thought to cause IBS symptoms.) * Uterine infection - no cause determined (negative STD panel) overnight hospitalization. Also came on rapidly, no tampons etc. involved. * enlarged liver/spleen found while following up on uterine infection, eventually resolved * pneumonia * Bigeminy suddenly that won't stop - can't sleep, dizzy. Persists for 3 weeks, goes away, comes back and persists for 4-6 weeks. ER gives IV & oral beta blockers that do not do anything. Eventually resolves a week or two after visit.  * multiple unexplained full body rashes, no known contact with any allergen, severely itchy & leaving blood spots under the skin for several days after disappearance of rash. Doctor suggested immune response to an unknown virus both times.  * severe migraine which I previously had no history of, enough to warrant ER as I didn't know what was happening. SUCKED!! BAD!!  **I'm posting because I am at my wits end. Beyond that medical history, my symptoms are cyclical with a few known triggers, since around age 12 and progressively worse, and are as follows:**     * insomnia - does not respond to sleeping medications (i.e. ambien) cannot \"sleep in\" even if going to bed very late. Difficulty both falling and staying asleep. * fatigue - constantly at least mild, often severe. Especially worse if I lose any of the precious small amount of sleep I do get. Not \"sleepy\" necessarily, but physically exhausted and weak. * Dizziness - especially upon standing. Vision goes black, head heavy, heart races, and I have to sit or lean against a wall with my eyes closed until it passes * lactation from left breast only, for years * poor circulation (nerves?) arms and legs go numb with slightest pressure. Cold/numb feet, legs turn purple in the shower. Doing hair is challenging as arms quickly become numb/weak when held up. Hands go  white or purple.  * joint and muscle pain, sometimes severe, especially hands, wrists, hips, knees.  * chest pain * tender muscles, as if strained or bruised with no known cause * trouble concentrating, poor memory * blurred vision. Suddenly/rapidly needed glasses at age 23 after perfect vision for whole life, even stronger prescription needed 2 years later. * hot flashes * nausea * feeling of being about to faint - cold sweat, vision blacking out, weakness, facial tingling, spinning. Have to lay down for the rest of the day when this happens, usually comes on the onset of illness.  Different from dizziness in that it distinctly feels like I am struggling to stay conscious and can hit any time. * Frequent, or even continuous URI, including one going on 5 months now. Including flu like symptoms, sinusitis, fever (99-103 recorded) sore throat/glands. At one point neck glands so swollen and severely painful I could not eat or speak for 2 days flu/strep negative.   All symptoms can be there in varying degrees/combinations on a daily, but within tolerable limits. On bad days I am essentially bed-bound with flu-like symptoms and severe fatigue, often diarrhea. This is always triggered by going to bed too late (for me this means no later than 9pm,) by too much physical exertion, or by traveling (anything stress related, even if I enjoy it.) I am doing less and less of the things I used to enjoy because it's not worth the sickness I know will come from staying out late or taking that walk, etc. I fear I will end up not being able to do my job which is fairly active, I spend all my afternoons and now some weekends as it is in bed recovering.     I have seen infectious disease, neurology, ENT, rheumatology, gynecology, and more. Multiple GPs. I can't get anyone to spend more than 5 minutes with me, and everyone seems to view any symptoms as acute and are not interested in my medical history. I.e. URI symptoms being a cold that should resolve in a week or two, though it has already been several months with no improvement and even worsening.     Results of any MRI, EKG, CAT scan, etc have been normal aside for what has been mentioned in medical history. Blood tests (CBC, nutrient, etc) all normal except occasionally low potassium, minor. Negative for flu every time, negative for tick borne illnesses, normal thyroid function, everything normal. Once I had low Vit D and took supplements to get it back up, did not improve symptoms, but no longer have low D. Only thing abnormal is occasionally low blood pressure.     **Please tell me where to go.**\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " Am a doc. Some of these comments are a little too focused. People seem to have experienced some of the same symptoms and associate it with their own diagnoses. I would not put too much weight in that.  My recommendations:  1. Begin by collecting thorough records from every place you have been. Ask for all lab results, doctor's notes, and imaging results as your new doctor is requesting to review these. You don't need to read through all of this, in fact it may just stress you out more as it can leave a lot of unclear information, but you want to be prepared with all of this.   2. You seem to have already done this to some extent. Write out all your past medical history and do so chronologically. Even better if you type out all the things listed on the first two pages here https://www.medschool.lsuhsc.edu/medical_education/undergraduate/spm/SPM_100/documents/HistoryandPhysical_000.pdf  3. Look for a special diagnostics clinic in your state. These are rare and usually found at big academic medical center, but may be worth it for you. They spend more time and specifically avoid the issues you mention of not looking at the whole history. Also most specialists just want to look at one side of the picture, these clinics offer a more balanced view. It is worth a many hour drive if you can find one of these in my opinion. Bringing one and two is critical to the success of those visits also.  4. Think about seeing a psychiatrist. I am not saying this is all in your head or anything like that. I know when I\u2019ve had a rough day I can feel miserable, and it can compound on itself. Having certain symptoms, then trying to live your life through that and also not having answers, is very stressful. It can make whole new symptoms pop up that have to do with stress rather than any underlying disease. Seeing someone can help clarify what symptoms are downstream consequences of stress and fatigue. It can also help with coping with not having an answer, and with the fact that an answer may not guarantee a solution.  I hope these thoughts help and wish you luck and support in this difficult journey."

Back in December, I started having more frequent panic attacks to the tune of 3-4 per week. My ARNP prescribed me 1.5mg of Ativan/Lorazepam daily and assured me that this was one of the weaker benzodiazepines and that I shouldn\u2019t have an issue coming off them even after years of use. After being at 1.5mg for about a month, I found out that Ativan is actually pretty potent and is certainly not easy to just quit. I was livid and started tapering myself off immediately. After a few months, I got myself down to .25mg per day.  Unfortunately I\u2019ve been stuck at .25mg for nearly two months now, if I try to drop any lower than that the muscles in my neck and back seize up and it\u2019s extremely painful. To make matters worse, due to Ativan\u2019s short half-life I\u2019ve now been experiencing interdose withdrawal. I told my prescriber about my problem, and he emailed me saying he\u2019d send over a script for 2.5mg Valium which is supposed to be much easier to taper from due to its long half-life. He didn\u2019t instruct me on how to transition and frankly, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d trust him to give me the correct info. He\u2019s been pretty careless with my meds in the past as well.  I\u2019ve read multiple things that indicate that you can\u2019t just swap Ativan for Valium in the equivalent dose, that it has to be done gradually. But I\u2019m not sure how to do that or if it\u2019s even necessary considering how low my dose is.   What would also really help me is if someone would explain why this needs to be a gradual transition, the pharmacology behind it. Is it because the GABAergic activity mostly comes from the metabolites of the drug and you need those to build up in your system?

If you don't match what the advert asks for, it dumps the resume. Trust me, this infuriates us as well. Try adding a section to your resume: Job Requirements and cut/paste the requirements section from the job ad into it.  2) Now you've got to a real human, along with perhaps 40 others. We're going to sift that down to maybe 3 to 5 for a phone screen. We'll do that almost entirely on your experience, and how relevant it is.  3) You got a call (from me quite often) - hooray! OK, at this point we're just trying to determine if you are slightly like the character we read about on the resume. If you can answer some basic stuff from your resume (What did you like most about...What interests you about....that sort of stuff) then we'll get you in for an interview (or right now set up a series of interviews via Teams or Zoom)  4) Interview proper. This will be with HR, the hiring manager, and at least 2 team members. Sometimes there will be technical questions, and yeah, we probably will ask you to show you can code a simple problem if you are applying for a software job, or design a simple circuit if you are hardware...  So....in a roundabout way, Im coming back to the last part of your question - what makes the difference? Stage 2 above is the only part where your qualifications and experience are all that important. You want to stand out above the crowd...but be aware that the thing that will do that most is directly relevant experience - internships, co-op positions, projects ...even hack stuff. If you have a masters that is DIRECTLY relevant, and someone else has 6 months of intern experience doing the job, then you probably both get a call. Masters/PhD in something tangential, not so much.  Hope this helps"

Some wind turbines froze due to the extreme cold, but some nuclear, natural gas, and coal plants also \"froze\" during the winter storm.   From APnews:  > ERCOT said Tuesday that of the 45,000 total megawatts of power that were offline statewide, about 30,000 consisted of thermal sources \u2014 gas, coal and nuclear plants \u2014 and 16,000 came from renewable sources.  2/3 of the electricity outage comes from thermal (\"normal\" with the exception of nuclear) and 1/3 comes from renewable.  Renewable energy froze in Texas, but so did everything else. Once the pipes in the natural gas or coal-fired plants froze, that plant went offline, and it required electricity to get unfrozen and started back up. If the infrastructure is not prepared to handle the cold, it may take a lot longer to unfreeze things.  Wind turbines are used in Antarctica; they aren't impossible to use in the cold. It is possible to weatherize power plants to insulate them from extreme cold. But this costs money, and it becomes a tradeoff of probability of occurring and cost to mitigate. The term \"once in a 100 year storm\" is thrown around a lot. At what point do you spend the money to \"insure\" your infrastructure against an improbable event? Apparently a similar type of outage occurred in 2011, but no significant changes were implemented.  There are a few complications that are harming current rescue/mitigation efforts. Texas is separate from the US electricity grid (from WSJ). Presumably, this is to \"have ownership in Austin, not Washington\" and to prevent \"burdensome\" regulatory compliance. I suspect that the regulatory compliance may better mitigate the effects of the cold, but this comes at a cost as mentioned above.  Texas may have connection to the federal grid to get emergency electricity, but some Texas laws prohibit selling excess electricity (not a problem right now) or buying electricity from other parts of the federal network (big problem right now). (Still reading through Texas code to find the exact source.) Again, that prevents the mitigation efforts.  Long story short is that Texas' infrastructure was not prepared for a prolonged winter storm and cold spell. My opinion is that a connected grid and compliance with federal regulations would have probably prevented this disaster from occurring.

In this case, one problem could be: documentation on this brand/model of waterjet shows that the pump is seriously overdue for a major overhaul maintenance procedure, and it is ill advised to start the pump without it. This procedure involves taking apart the pump to pieces, replacing many parts, then reassembling. This is typically done by the manufacturer and costs $XXXX to do. I got a hold of the pump maintenance procedure and engineer/technician/other coworker Bill says he has experience with this sort of stuff and we could do it in house and pay only for the replacement parts, $XXX, but we run the risk of irreparable damage to the pump.

Some history:  The MSRE (Molten Salt Reactor Experiment) that ran from 1965 until 1969 and went critical on U233 proving LFTRs (Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor) viability.  This is fact, not fiction.  The pressurized water reactors we use today were originally designed for use in submarines.  When time came for us to use nuclear reactors for civilian power generation, we were already heavily invested in this type of reactor.  There was a strong incentive not to \"reinvent the wheel\".   There was funding for the ARE (Aircraft Reactor Experiment), which was the first molten salt reactor, which eventually led to the MSRE.  The MSRE went critical on U233 and proved LFTRs viability.  U233 is bred from Thorium and is the actual fuel of a LFTR.    Eventually the air force realized it was idiotic to put a reactor in an airplane, and from a military perspective, U233 bred from Thorium proved far too difficult to weaponize due to inherent U232 contamination which has daughter fission products that are strong gamma emitters and destroy bomb electronics as well as delivering lethal doses of radiation in minutes meaning weapons would have to be assembled/handled remotely, not to mention that satellite gamma detectors can see such strong gamma emissions clearly making it impossible to hide such a weapon.   From a military perspective LFTRs are worthless.    That is why the Nixon administration pulled funding for the MSRE and fired Alvin Weinberg (who invented and held the patents for the reactors we use today) from his post as head of Oak ridge National Laboratory,  when he refused to sit down and shut up about how LFTRs were superior in every respect for power generation.  The Nixon administration instead choose to pursue the liquid metal fast breeder a sodium cooled reactor in hopes they could breed PU239 from U238 for use in weapons.  That is the history of why we are using old navy submarine reactors for our nuclear power generation.  **Ok so why aren't we using LFTRS now?**  --------------------  (1) There is no incentive for the nuclear industry to invest in the development of a new type of reactor. They construct reactors at cost and make money on the sale of fuel rods, much like an inkjet printer business model. With a LFTR you don't have to fabricate the fuel, just toss in the Thorium and go. This goes against their business model. The status quo is good for business.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVSmf_qmkbg&feature=youtu.be&t=4841  --------------------    (2) Under the current legal and regulatory framework it would be impossible to build one in the USA,  it would require billions in lobbying  to make it happen, and again their is no financial incentive for any company to do that.  (There is a video of Kirk Sorensen discussing the challenges with requirements for safety features that are both unnecessary and impossible to implement in a LFTR that are required for a LWR, I am having trouble finding the video and time stamp for this.)  --------------------------   (3) Lack of military application, LFTRs breed Uranium 233 from Thorium 232, but always produce some degree of Uranium 232 contamination. Because of this it is unsuitable for use in weapons. It will not get military funding.    Robert Hargraves is a study leader for energy policy at Dartmouth ILEAD.  Robert Hargraves graduated from Brown University (PhD Physics 1967)  http://www.thoriumenergyalliance.com/downloads/American_Scientist_Hargraves.pdf  *\"The uranium-233 produced from thorium-232 is necessarily accompanied by uranium-232, a proliferation prophylactic. Uranium-232 has a relatively short half-life of 73.6 years, burning itself out by producing decay products that include strong emitters of high-energy gamma radiation. The gamma emissions are easily detectable and highly destructive to ordnance components, circuitry and especially personnel. Uranium-232 is chemically identical to and essentially inseparable from uranium-233.\"*  ...  *\"Only a determined, well-funded effort on the scale of a national program could overcome the obstacles to illicit use of uranium-232/233 produced in a LFTR reactor. Such an effort would certainly find that it was less problematic to pursue the enrichment of natural uranium or the generation of plutonium.\"*  *\"the proportion of U-232 would be about 0.13% for a commercial power reactor. A year after separation, a weapons worker one meter from a subcritical 5 kg sphere of such U-233 would receive a radiation dose of 43 mSv/hr, compared to 0.003 mSv/hr from plutonium, even less from U-235. Death becomes probable after 72 hours exposure. After ten years this radiation triples.\"*  *\"resulting weapons would be highly radioactive and therefore dangerous to military workers nearby. The penetrating 2.6 MeV gamma radiation is an easily detected marker revealing the presence of such U-233, possibly even from a satellite.\"*  *\"For personnel safety, any U-233 material operations must be accomplished by remote handling equipment within a radioactively shielded hot cell. This can be designed to make it very hard for any insiders or outsiders to remove material from the hot cell.\"*  Thorium Energy Cheaper Than Coal - Robert Hargraves  https://www.amazon.com/THORIUM-energy-cheaper-than-coal/dp/1478161299   -------------------------------------------------------     (4) It is opposed by fossil fuel, renewable, and existing nuclear industries as it would render them all irrelevant.  (this is my personal view, as unlimited cheap energy from any source goes against the best interests of these industries)  ----------------------------------------   (5) Greenpeace and hippies hate anything with the word nuclear in it, and they refuse to listen to facts about LFTR technology. It is like arguing with a brick wall.    https://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/nuclear-reaction/the-mythologies-of-thorium-and-uranium/blog/48625/    https://theecologist.org/2014/mar/26/exposing-thorium-myth  Jan Ber\u00e1nek is the leader of Greenpeace International's Energy Campaign.  https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/business/global/20renthorium.html  \"Environmental advocates, including Greenpeace International, also dismiss thorium-based systems as a distant dream\"  http://energyfromthorium.com/rees-article-rebuttal/  So he employed five witnesses in his case against thorium and LFTR, each intended to show that there is hype or deception involved. They are:  ...  Neil Crumpton of Friends of the Earth  Jean McSorley, senior consultant for the anti-nuclear campaign waged by Greenpeace.  If I am not mistaken Jill Stein the last Green party candidate opposed LFTR for similar reasons but I am having trouble finding that video/article I read.    ------------------    (6) People are ignorant and aren't demanding our government invest in LFTR technology. Many have this attitude that if it were that good we would be using it already so it must be a hoax or a scam like a water powered car. It's sad really the thought we could uplift the developing world out of poverty and boost our standard of living tremendously, all from a technology that was proven more than 50 years ago, and NO ONE CARES.  (Source personal experience)  --------------------  (7) It would likely take perhaps several hundred billion dollars to go from a small prototype reactor that was built more than 50 years ago, to a 1000MW commercial reactor.  It would take government funding with a military budget to make this happen.    (This was from a private discussion with pro LFTR nuclear engineer, and the several hundred billion was the ballpark estimate he gave me, though this is just a guess)"

A couple of things for me is to do everything I can to separate work from non-work time. I always dress \u201cup\u201d for work, and change clothes to comfy home clothes as soon as I\u2019m done. I do this even if I don\u2019t have any video meetings that day. I always put my work computer away fully over the weekend even if it\u2019s easier to leave it all setup on my desk. I listen to different kinds of music genres depending on if I\u2019m working or if it\u2019s in my spare time. Taking a walk / run outdoors at the end of the workday is a good way to create separation too. Exercising in itself is also a good way for me to decompress and de-stress - but with the caveat that it can become a coping mechanism (which is not necessarily a good solution to become dependent on it to be able to function mentally). Me and my team also do a quick check-in every morning and at the end of each workday (video chat usually)\u2026 to just quickly run through what we\u2019re working on today (and what we\u2019ve achieved during the day, respectively). This helps us all to define the workday by formally starting and ending it together.

When it comes to therapy, it\u2019s something I generally think everyone should *try* at least once. As long as it doesn\u2019t need to go deep into long-term psychotherapy and so on. Just having someone to vent your thoughts to, about the most \u201cunimportant\u201d (to others) shit, with full confidentiality can be a wonderful thing.

I am only one of a few engineers at a very small company and in the interview and job description I was told there would be 50% - 75% travel, a week home every two weeks of travel is what they said.  I really enjoy the work and I think if I were to stick with this job it would be extremely beneficial to my career, specifically with networking. All of our clients are the big web giants of the industry, think Microsoft, Amazon, Google, etc. and I get the opportunity to work with top engineers daily at these companies that manage work sites at a national level. This gives me a lot of hope through making connections and hopefully getting a job with one of them a couple of years down the road.  The issue is that I\u2019m almost two months into the job and it has been 100% travel, I work 10-11 hour days, and the pay is mediocre and not even a raise from my last job, $64k.  They are hoping to not be as busy after thanksgiving and have some weeks of no travel but I\u2019m not sure how things will be any different. I only took the job because it\u2019s a great way to finally get my foot in the door and was really my only option. To make things worse, we found out my wife was pregnant right when I accepted the job and I don\u2019t think this much travel will be an option for me after my first kid is born. My wife is very depressed being alone and pretty much cries herself to sleep every night. The reason I think the pay is so bad is because my brother has a very similar job but does not even travel nearly as often, has no engineering degree or any degree for that matter, and he gets paid $85k+. I would have pursued that job but I don\u2019t think it would have as good of a future for an engineer. The only way I would see my job being worth it is if I was making $95k+ a year and could see a future where my family will live comfortably, I just don\u2019t know if that\u2019s asking too much since I\u2019m so early in my career. How can I possibly negotiate with my bosses about my wants? If I left this job I would have no clue how else I could move forward in my career. It would just be nice to have a week working from home every once in awhile, like I was promised, that my wife and I can look forward to.\n\nAssistant:"

And the way they got that reputation was by actual, whole-scale slaughter of people who resisted them. If a Mongol army knocks on your doorstep, you surrender. If you do so, your civilians are usually spared but the garrison will be put to slaughter. If you resist, it means death for everybody. Does not matter how small of a resistance it is. Im quoting from John Man's *The Mongol Empire*:  >The Khwarezmian massacres were all one-off applications of a decision to use terror for strategic purposes; not genocide, the killing of a people, but the killing of towns \u2013 a tactic that deserves its own term: urbicide. It wasn\u2019t personal or obsessive. It was dispassionate, cold-blooded murder, with one purpose: to win as quickly and as cheaply as possible.  That was their tactic. Much like other sedentary civilizations, the cities of Khwarezmid empire was huge. Bukhara, the capital had 300,000 in population. Samarkand, Bukhara, Merv and Gurganj were the most important and populous cities of the empire. Otrar was the city, where the governor who killed the trade caravan Inalchuk, was at. And when we see the fates of these cities, to the ones that surrendered and ones that resisted, we see the pattern of urbicide, as described above.  Otrar the city was left mostly alone. The Mongols had strict orders to take the governor alive and they did after a long siege. Bukhara had the same fate. The people opened the gates unwilling to die for the sultan and the garrison retreated into the Ark, the citadel. The population was enslaved but the garrison was wiped clean. Men were pressed into the vanguard to serve as cannon fodder or military service. Women and children into enslavement and the artisans pressed into service. This was the way the Mongols did things. Ortar and Bukhara were special cases due to their status. To see the Mongols warfare in action, we need to look at the other cities that were in their path.  The best case would be the comparison between Herat, which surrendered and the cities that didnt, namely Gurganj(Urgench currently), Nishapur and Merv. Herat's populace was spared except for its 12,000 strong garrison which was killed. Merv is what we will focus on since it shows the complete ruthlessness of the Mongols when facing resistance. Urgench was described as the hardest fight the Mongols faced and when the city fell the Mongols were in no mood for mercy. Quoting from the book again:  >By the time victory came in early 1221, the invaders were in no mood for mercy. Citizens with any skill \u2013 100,000 of them \u2013 were led away as captives, the rest slaughtered. Juvaini speaks of 50,000 soldiers killing twenty-four men each. That makes 1.2 million.  Merv is a very important look because the resistance wasnt huge or even considerable. In January 1221, 800 mongols arrived at its walls and probed the defenses. They were chased off but about 60 of them were captured and killed. When Genghis heard the news, Merv's fate was sealed. Part of the army was dispatched, which was about 7000 strong. They faced a garrison of about 12,000. With the Mongols terrorizing the countryside, Merv which usually had a population of 70,000 had almost 10 times that. Since they already killed the captured Mongols, they kinda knew their fate. And they bolted the doors and waited. The Mongols themselves, were only too happy to wait. For six days, they did nothing but patrol the walls. Seeing no other choice, the governor sued for peace. The Mongols asked for 200 of the wealthiest citizens just like they did in Bukhara, and took their wealth. Then, they entered the city and sat upon vengance for the killing of the Mongols by the governor. As usual, enormous care was taken to separate artisans from the general populace but they let loose their reign of terror otherwise. Quoting again:  >Then the killing started. The place was ransacked, the buildings mined, the books burned or buried. Merv died in days, and lost almost everything and almost everyone. As Juvaini records, the Mongols ordered that, apart from the 400 captured artisans, \u2018the whole population, including the women and children should be killed, and no one, whether man or woman be spared. The people of Merv were then distributed among the soldiers and levies and, in short, to each man was allotted the execution of three or four hundred persons.\u2019  A cleric states that he counted 1 million and 100,000 dead in Merv after the Mongols left. Quite possibly inflated number but goes to show you the ruthless tactic of killing to spread terror that the Mongols practiced.   Source:  John Man, The Mongol Empire."

Thinkers almost always contradict in some way as they each are, in the end, creating their own proofs for an untruth, and even single theories often have obvious points of contradiction and inconsistency. But in any case, that dispensed with, the term \"Aryan\" as we think of it in the strains of racial pseudoscience where it is most commonly associated with Nazism is most significantly a result of the writings of Arthur de Gobineau, a Frenchman with pretensions of aristocracy (self-styled as Comte de Gobineau) writing in the mid-1800s, and best known for our purposes for this work *Essai sur l\u2019Ine\u0301galite\u0301 des Races Humaines*.   Gobineau wasn't doing anything particularly new in his approach to writing on ideas of race and his work reflected common ideas of a noble Germanic race which was superior to all, terms the \"Nordic\" myth, and which traces back at least another century to the writings of another Frenchman, Henri de Boulainvilliers, and which subdivided the people of France into the Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean types, placing the Nordics at the top, and exemplifying them as, put succinctly, the \"descendants of ancient Germanic tribes, the originators of all civilization, and the only peoples capable of leadership\".  Gobineau took this and expanded on it, but writing in the 1850s, added onto it new ideas which had entered into the intellectual milieu of the time, and one of these was the use of the term \"Aryan\", which although first applied in India, was a linguistic term created by a British official to describe the ur-language shared by a vast swathe of the globe, what we would now term Indo-European. The idea of Aryanness language was promoted by several figures before Gobineau, but he made it essentially his own with the way he melded it to racial thinking. The logic of course was quite simple, if the Nordics were the originators of all civilization, and Aryan language the roots of all language, presumably the Aryans and the Nordics were the same thing. But of course he doesn't stop there either, adding in ideas about purity of the blood and corruption caused by mixing of the races.   Whites were the superior race, Aryans the best of the whites, and mixing with the inferior races - \"White\", \"Yellow\", \"Black\", which he based on the three sons of Noah -  risked the very existence of civilization itself. The purer the Aryan blood, the better the civilization, the weaker, the worse. Aryans had propagated far and wide - settling Europe, Iran, and India -  hence why traces were found even in the latter, but even in Europe, where the Germanics represented the purest specimen remaining, they faced great dangers of decline which Gobineau already believed to be well advanced and needed to be arrested quickly. Gobineau was hardly ignorant of the place of India in all of this, and in fact based much of his work on readings of the *Rig Veda* which he believed supported the story of Genesis. Figueria summarizes other Sanskrit literature he drew on thusly, using them as evidence for the eventual degradation of the Aryans in india due to dilution from long intermingling with the \"aborigines\":  >The *Mahabharata* bore witness to the manner in which Indian society had been invaded by foreign elements.9 Savage vices, absent from the *Ramayana*, appear full-blown in the history of the Pandavas, who had been raised to divine status in order to veil the blood sins of their mothers. In other words, Gobineau read the epics as chronicles of non-Aryan promiscuity and Aryan battles to avoid the dilution of their bloodlines.  This he held up as a warning for what Germany was going through, and the threat to Aryan purity of the Germanics, which they needed to work to stop.  Later thinkers built off this further. Ernst Haeckel's *The Riddle of the Universe: At the Close of the Nineteenth Century* would prove to be an especially influential one in his specific focus on tying in the Aryan Myth with Germanic nationalism and ideas of *Volk*, and the preeminence of the blonde, blue-eyed ideal, which of course are so closely entwined with the popular image of Nazi ideas which would come later.   But perhaps none is a more important bridge between Gobineau and the Nazis than Houston Stewart Chamberlain, who wrote *Foundations of the Nineteenth Century*. An Englishman by birth, he was fascinated by *Germanness*, marrying Wagner's daughter, and writing German propaganda through the First World War. *Foundations* pushed the Aryan Myth heavily, and was a work admired by Hitler himself, and of many things, is known for being a key part of the attempt to demonstrate that Jesus was, in fact, not Jewish but of Aryan persuasion, which of course ties into the virulent anti-Semitism pushed by all of the writers mentioned here, Chamberlain being a key part in developing Hitler's belief that the Jews needed to be entirely removed from German society.  It also of course it worth mentioning the American Madison Grant who wrote *The Passing of the Great Race: or The Racial Basis of European History* which likewise played in important part in the propagation of the Aryan Myth, and played a key role in the creation of the eugenics movement in early 20th c. America.  But in any case, that is the rough summary of it all. \"*Aryan*\" was a term latched onto by 19th century thinkers for their writings on racial pseudoscience as it fit well with their ideas of a master race, a ruling class, which had once been spread far and wide. Gobineau, as did others, used esoteric and wildly ahistorical readings of texts and evidence to support this view, explain away incongruities, and place their Germanic ideal in the place of this master race in their way of thinking. Although India was a key part of the origin of the term \"Aryan\", these racial thinkers were careful to explain why India itself, of course, was not the exemper of the Aryan race, and instead held it up as an example of how far the white race could fall.  **Sources**  Evans, Richard J.. *The Coming of the Third Reich.* Penguin, 2005.

Your question states that you are interested in 'Europe', so I hope an answer based on English practices is of at least some help.  In terms of English burial practices, these 'vampire' burials are often the result of a suicide. A key bit of context here lies in understanding beliefs about the dead body. In both pre and post Reformation theology, the body continues to be of great importance even after death, as it is the earthly remains which will be resurrected into holy bodies on Judgement Day (see 1 Corinthians 15:35-58). Though body and soul have been separated, the body is still of central importance to the departed (one of the reasons that Catholic funerals tend to involve burial, not cremation, in order to receive the best chance of resurrection).  This leads to a situation which can seem a little bizarre to the modern mind, wherein individuals can be punished *after* their death through ill-treatment of their corpse. Famously, Oliver Cromwell and other figures involved in the regicide of Charles I were disinterred from their graves in order to be 'posthumously executed' (in this case, by beheading). ^1  Suicide was regarded as one of the most unforgivable crimes in early modern England. It represented a rejection of God's gift of life, with no opportunity to repent - it was an assured route to Hell, and an enormous shame to the community, where even the living relatives of the suicide would be punished. A posthumous coroner\u2019s jury would try cases of suicide, and if found guilty, the individual in question would have all of their movable goods and any leases on land surrendered to the crown, or a holder of a royal patent which granted them the right to such windfalls. ^2  When it came to interring the body of a suicide, several considerations are at play. It was considered so important to be buried 'decently' (involving proper covering of the corpse in a shroud, a peal of bells, and a minister to officiate) that even if a corpse of a stranger were to be found within the parish, funds would be raised to have them buried decently in consecrated ground. ^3 This decency was not afforded to a suicide. At best, they could be expected to be buried just outside of the consecrated land of the churchyard, but there are also numerous cases of the 'vampire burials' you describe.  Burial at a crossroads was considered to be a particularly apt site for the burial of a suicide. It lacked the respect and reverence of a consecrated site, where the body would constantly be travelled over by traffic. A stake was often driven through the body in such burials. Two factors are at play here - the denial of Christian burial, and the playing out of superstitious beliefs about the unquiet dead. This process of 'vampire'-style burial served as a warning to the community and defiled the sinful body, but also had practical considerations designed to ensure that the harmful influence of suicide did not remain within the community \u2013 the stake prevented the ghost from walking, and the crossroads were intended to diffuse the evil influence of the defiled body in order to reduce the harm it could cause.^3  It's outside the scope of my field to answer what other causes may produce this type of burial, and whether the motivations were significantly different in other parts of Europe. However, in England at least, these style burials are closely associated with punishing a suicide, and preventing harm to the remaining community.

                "content": " So, Switzerland was one of the last countries where women gained the right to vote, though it was not the last one. Excluding those that \u2013 you know \u2013 do not vote or don't have hardly any women as citizens and do not vote like the Vatican, Liechtenstein was actually the last country in Europe to do so in 1984.  But while in the case of Liechtenstein, this relates to the fact that their structures are not as democratic elsewhere and their ruler has way too much power, in Switzerland the reason it took so long is due to their direct democratically political structure and due to the fact that Switzerland as the every neutral country they are has not undergone and experienced the major political shift or revolution other countries have undergone at the beginning of the 20th century. Take it's neighbors: Austria, Germany, and Italy all underwent what can only be classified as a political revolution at the end of WWI and it was very much within that context, and political movements like the Social Democrats which had been previously fighting the old order gaining power that women received the right to vote. France took considerably longer but them introducing women's suffrage in 1945 was also preceded by what arguably can be seen as civil war and a sort of political revolution.  Switzerland had had a suffrage movement dating back to the 19th century. While its 1848 constitution did introduce a federal structure that was decidedly very, very federalist as opposed to centrist and provided the groundwork for the political system of Switzerland, it was interpreted in a way that suffrage only extended to males (the constitution says \"All Swiss are equal before the law\" but the reason why they didn't extend this to women was because, well, they interpreted it that way and also because several Kantons did connect the right to vote with previously having served in the Swiss armed forces \u2013 something women were not allowed to do).  Anyways, in 1866 a first petition was filed to extend the right to vote to women and many organizations and women campaigned in the following years for the right to suffrage. And they did make progress. In 1874 a first revision with regards to women was accepted that lead to civil right equality (meaning they were able to legally own property and so forth) but not the right to vote.  The first major chance for change came in 1922 when several Kantons held referenda about women's suffrage and these were rejected and here is also where we come to the specifics of the Swiss political system. While Switzerland has a parliament, a lot of their political decisions are made either on the level of federal states, the Kantons, or through public referenda, where the voters are presented with options to vote over.  For a change of the constitution, such as women's suffrage, it requires both: A majority of the popular vote in a referendum as well as a majority of the votes of the Kantons. How the Kantons figure out how they vote in such matters was for the majority of the 20th century, up to them. They could hold referenda, they could let their representatives decided or just draw straws for all that matters (they did not draw straws though).  So, in essence, while there probably would have been a majority for women's suffrage at least at some points in time or at least in some Kantons, overall, the introduction of women's suffrage in Swizerland required the male population to vote for it in a referendum. And like the general dynamic of asking people to share power, there was for a long time a very decided anti-women's suffrage standpoint among the male voters.  The Swiss League against women's suffrage, a 1920s organization, said as much when they argued that equal voting rights for women and women's equality in general are ideas \"imported from foreign countries\" and that \"Swiss women are not interested in such frivolities\".  Anyways, after the Second World War the Swiss political landscape and culture did change a bit. What first pushed the idea forward was a referendum over the possibility for women to take part in a civil protection corps (like doing stuff for the military in case of an invasion) and the inclusion of the Social Democrats in the Swiss federal government, which pushed women's rights forward.  So, in 1959 a referendum on women's suffrage was held and 67% of the popular vote and almost all of the Kantons save 3 voted no. This reinvigorated the women's suffrage movement that during WWII had somewhat lost its steam. This team, also catholic women's organizations took part and while further inroads were made, what really lead to the final push necessary for women's suffrage is the 1968 students movement and radical feminist politics.  In the wale of 1968 protests erupted all over the country instigated by radical feminist organizations who had split from previous women's suffrage organizations and in 1969 staged a demonstration of 5000 people in the Swiss capital, Bern. Now, 5000 doesn't sound like much but for Swiss conditions this was huge. And the government became shaken by this. When more conservative organization also started supporting some of the house-occupying, public protesting radical feminists, the government saw itself backed into a corner while under the impression of the massive cultural changes of the late 60s and early 70s, which all over Europe made young and younger people more receptive to social and political change after the stuffy atmosphere of post-WWII Europe the population in Switzerland was much more receptive to the idea of women's suffrage.  After some to and fro between the Bundesrat, the Nationrat and the St\u00e4nderat (the various parliaments and representative chambers in Switzerland) a new referendum was held in 1971 65% of the popular vote voted for women's suffrage while 15 \u00bd Cantons (there are Cantons that only count for half a vote) voted yes against 6 \u00bd Cantons that voted no. And thus, women's suffrage was introduced in Switzerland.  In all of Switzerland? No, one bastion of the detractors of women's suffrage still held out in form of the Kanton Appenzell Innerrhoden (also Appenzell Au\u00dferrhoden but they weren't the last ones). Appenzell Innerrhoden, a very rural and conservative Kanton, refused to adopt the law and waged a legal and political battle against women's suffrage until they finally relented in 1990 when they were sued in front of the Federal Court of Switzerland.  As for causing controversy, this for the most part exceeds my expertise but one thing where this caused problems is when Switzerland tried to become part of the European Human Rights Declaration in the late 1960s, since that Declaration includes explicit reference to universal suffrage. So, this took until 1974 because essentially, Switzerland violated the European Human Rights Convention.  But in terms of why it took so long: The main reason is a political system that enables a group in power to directly vote on sharing these votes with others and as such things are often wont to turn out, this majorly frustrated the extension of basic democratic human rights to over half of the population of Switzerland until a major culture change came along and was promoted in radical ways by feminists.

This will make us one of the 125 largest subreddits on this site.  This is going to present a few new challenges for us.  Here they are with their answer.  **1)  Default status.**  Askhistorians WILL NEVER BECOME A DEFAULT SUB IF WE HAVE ANY SAY SO.  I believe the way we put it in moderator discussion was, \"I would rather burn this sub to the ground than let it become a default sub.\"  That was me, I said that, and everyone agreed.  We have already set the system to not allow this sub to become part of the default set.  **2)  More posters**  We recognize that there are more people posting here.  Therefore we have a few things in place.  Firstly, we will be contacting users we have singled out for their quality posting to become moderators.  This will bring the team up to about 17 moderators.  This will allow moderators to participate as well as moderate as it will take some of the stress off of them.  Additionally we would like to direct you to [the Panel thread and the Quality Contributor thread.  If you feel that you would like to receive flair or nominate someone for flair, feel free to use these links to nominate yourself or others.  Additionally, more posters means more users unfamiliar with this subreddits rules and culture.  So let me direct you again to OUR RULES as well as our GUIDELINES FOR RULES.  Think of them like this, the Rules = Constitution, Clarification = The Laws.  Both are enforceable, and will be.  We also request that you view the POPULAR QUESTIONS thread before you ask.  **3)Now we need to also make a few of our rules clear to you guys, again.  These are the important rules**  1)  20 year rule.  If it has occurred in the past twenty years, it is off limits pending moderator review.  2)  NO RACISM, SEXISM, HOMOPHOBIA, OR OTHER BIGOTED BEHAVIOR  I am so not kidding.  Do not think you are being clever, we have many historians in this sub who actually specialize in racial, sexual, or gender history INCLUDING A MOD.  We have had more than enough experience in recognizing the behavior.  Yes, if you come here and post something racist and you are from one of the several racist or other biggoted subreddits, we will not only thoroughly thrash your propaganda, but we will also ban you.  Yes, we will read through your posting history to see if you have a history of bigotry.  3)  No soapboxing or speechifying.  You hate America?  Fine, go somewhere else.  You a die hard college communist?  Great.  Go somewhere else.  This is not the place to recruit, to rabble rouse, to instigate.  At this point we have plenty of experience spotting that too.  You will have your post removed.  4)  Copy Pasting **ANY SOURCE** as your only way of posting, is VERBOTEN.  People come here to receive quality, in depth analysis from historians, history students, and history buffs.  Please assume the OP of the question isn't a complete moron and has googled for the answer.  Additionally, this is /r/askhistorians, not /r/askgoogle.  Yes, you can copy and paste a source and give a summary of that link and source,  but simply throwing up a link or a wall of copied text is intellectually lazy and will result in the post being removed.  5)  On topic, relevant humor only.  No memes, advice animals, reaction gifs, or funny videos are allowed.  The humor cannot be top tiered comments.  Humor is allowed to stray more off topic in *meta threads only*.  Jokes otherwise must be relevant, on topic, and hopefully funny.  I personally hate puns.  6)  Topic drift.  The original Godwins Law stated that the longer a UseNet conversation went the more likely Hitler was to be brought up.  It meant the thread was dead.  Here we also avoid topic drift.  A logical progression of topics being brought up is allowed, but please, don't let a thread on 19th Century agriculture end up about cow tipping.  7) Anecdotes are frowned upon.  Unless you were there yourself at the event, its probably not a strong enough source.  8) If you are guessing, or you heard from something somewhere some time ago, don't bother.  We will delete with extreme prejudice.  9) Wikipedia is the worst possible source you can use.  Its acceptable at times, and in a pinch, but it really isn't a good source.  If you couldn't use it in a paper, it probably wont work here.   **4) Eternal~~kerri~~ September  In light of the ever expanding number of users, of course there will be cries of Eternal September.  The moderation team can only do so much.  We need the user base to assist us by flagging violating posts as spam.  We also want you to understand **we enforce rules here**.  If you have a problem with the rules, address them to the moderation team, but Braveheart style speeches do not endear us to your plight (neither does calling us faggots after we ban you).  The level of our enforcement and strictness of enforcement, as well as our patience is directly inverse to the level of chicanery in the sub.  The more the rules are violated, the more people flagrantly violate them, the more people thumb their noses at the mods, the more likely we are to increase the intensity and harshness of our moderation.  This is your sub, we just enforce the rules.  If your fellow users cannot police themselves and you are not willing to assist in helping them understand they are violating the rules, then we will have to enforce the rules more and more strictly until we suck every bit of fun out of the sub.\n\nAssistant:"

Without going into too much detail and losing focus on the main question at hand, it's crucial to discuss how popular western understanding of Buddhism is heavily built upon the work of Buddhist propagation in the 20th century. In the 1900's onwards, Buddhism would begin to truly take hold in Europe and America as a practice, where previously knowledge of the religion (and I do say religion, this is a wholly separate and complicated argument and matter which we will not explore not) mostly came from explorers, missionaries, historians, and philosophers. Theravadin Buddhism occupied the most interest in the first half of the 20th century, accessible due to colonial presence in Theravadin countries. With Japan's defeat in World War II, Zen came to be truly globalized. Tibetan traditions also have a notable presence, greatly due to the political situation of the Chinese invasion of Tibet and the Dalai Lama's subsequent flight and advocacy work. A second wave of immigration from Southeast Asia can be credit from -political, economic, and social instability, prompting growing communities of Vietnamese Mahayanan and Southeast Theravadin traditions.  Why do I mention all this? Because the practice of Buddhism in the west is noticeably different than in Asia. Whereas Western Buddhism heavily focuses on and specializes in meditation and contemplation, the various kinds of Buddhism in Asia treat the religion on a much more intimate, everyday, and cultural level. In the same manner a churchgoer interacts with the community through practice, ritual, holidays, etc, the Buddhist in Asia does not only focus on the dharma, but the relationship with the laity and the monastic. Historically, the monks were the vanguard of the tradition, and they served the community by offering the spiritual, moral, ethical, ritual, educational guidance. Laypersons were observers and offered whatever was necessary to sustain the monastery. The differences in proportion of layperson to monk in the west and east must also be highlighted. Fewer ordained and qualified teachers in the west means the entire practice of Buddhism needed to change, and the monk-layperson relationship drastically adapted to new conditions.  As such, there have been efforts to alter, deemphasis, and deminish the religious and worship aspects of Buddhism, to be compatible with spiritual trends and social circumstances of the mid to late 20th century. We must understand that Christianity's overwhelming historical presence in Europe and America has heavily impacted society and culture. Alternative options to the dominant norm are always sought after, and Buddhism is one of them. This was especially the case in the 20th century, with the growth of New Religion Movements and a tendency to look towards Asia as a guide for spirituality. This further shapes how Buddhism is to be shared and taught with a different kind of audience. (This is why we also see differences today with American Buddhism and Ethnic Buddhism, the kind practiced by ethnic and immigrant communities.) Meditation and personal insight as a means to achieve liberation and spiritual cultivation is a major focus accessible to the laity in America and Europe. It is not just something reserved for the dedicated monks, the common layperson can participate too. And this is compatible with western conditions, as Buddhism offers a path that isn't in servitude towards a God or higher being, but rather, the personal self. This is why we might mainly focus on or understand the dharma and its ideas as concepts such as the paramitas and the Four Noble Truths. It is also critical to distinguish *detachment* from *asceticism*, which is something discussed in the Middle Way and cautioned by the Buddha. Asceticism is an extreme, not encouraged in Buddhism. However, there are historical instances of intensive devotional acts, but this cannot be considered the norm. The lifestyle of the monastic is certainly rigid, restrained, and intense, but ascetic is somewhat of a misleading term.  To return to my main point here, Buddhism in the east and west are engaged and understood differently. We may understand parts of the dharma as removing attachment, reliance, craving, towards material and impermanent things. These elements, of course, aren't neglected in Asia, but the Buddha and other Buddhist figures represent other ideas of wisdom, salvation, guidance, and meaning. This is why you may find gilded figurines and statues in Tibet and Southeast Asia. Why the offering of merit is so crucial to Burmese society. Why temple goers regularly prey and offer incense in China. Simply put, aesthetics, images, and physical, consumable, and tangible things help one to understand and engage with Buddhism. This is effected by, effects, and intermingles with culture of whichever society Buddhism is in. Ostentatious art is just a natural result of this.  &nbsp;   ---  **Part 2a - Answering the Main Question, On Statues and Grandiosity**  ---  &nbsp;   Okay, so now that we somewhat understand why some arts and aesthetics of Buddhism may be fanciful and extravagant, why are Buddhist statues so darn big?  We must explore this by dividing time between the pre-modern and modern world. Firstly, we can consider the ancient world and earlier Buddhism. I will try to create a narrative from three examples, Central Asia, China, and Japan, each relying on the preceding civilization with the transmission of Buddhism and its art and practices.  Buddhism originated in the Northern India/Nepal region, and made its way south and west. Buddhism would take an immense hold in Gandhara/Central Asia, up until the great social changes of Islamic conquest. As such, Buddhism spread through the Silk Road, and would be impacted by other ideas with it. Alexander's conquests brought the importance of Hellenistic culture to Persia, Central Asia, India, and China. This is significant as the Greco-Roman valuing of the human figure would dramatically influence art in the aforementioned regions. There is some debate in art history regarding the significance and impact of cultures on one another, though. Large statues of human-like and animal figures existed in Egypt and the Achaemenid Empire. Subjects can vary, be it royalty, rulers, deities, or other mythological figures. Nevertheless, it could be fair to suggest that Hellenistic, Egyptian, and Persian aesthetic values had some impact on Central Asia.  This is why the Bamyan Statues, destroyed in 2001 by the Taliban, are/were such important examples of early Buddhist art. Previously, depictions of the Buddha and other Buddhist figures in the Gandharan region might take form in stupas and statues, but those would not exceed 10m/33ft in height. The larger Buddha in Bamiyan was 53m/174ft in height, while the smaller was 35m/115ft. Not only that, the famous monk-traveler Xuanzang describes them as to be decorated with precious stones and gold. These large statues would be an imposing and awe-inspiring site, one highly praised by residents and visitors alike. It would also represent the devotion of the people, the power of the ruler, and the admiration and respect followers would have towards the Buddha."

                "content": " In short, yes. I've written previously on the broader topic of Soviet pro-natalist policies in the period surrounding the war - Did the USSR suffer from a reverse \"Baby Boom\", a slump in birth rates after World War II? - of which I've reposted a revised version below:  ----------  Throughout its history, while the USSR portrayed itself, rhetorically, as a country that practiced gender equality, and where women were given opportunities unavailable to their sisters in the West, the reality of life as a woman in the Soviet Union did not always live up to its promise, with pragmatic necessity of state aims often taking precedence, and the rhetoric of equality in constant tension with the \"traditional\" views of gender roles that remained strongly engrained within Soviet society. One of the clearest ways to trace this its through shifting approaches regarding women and motherhood, and the pro-natalist policies that drove those shifts. Looking at pro-natalist policies in the Soviet Union, especially with regards to abortion, we can see a *lot* of policy being driven by concerns about the birthrate, and its rise and fall. This is particularly evident in the periodic changes to the law concerning abortion, which teetered between pragmatic necessity and state needs for more manpower, as well as the state policies in the wake of the Second World War, where massive gender imbalances drove *temporary* changes in regards to state views on the importance of the nuclear family, and single-motherhood.  **Before the War**  In the Russian Empire, and the first few years of Bolshevik rule in Russia, abortion was illegal. But, as in most places where the procedure is illegal though, the procedure was nevertheless popular, but insanely dangerous. One observer pre-1920 noted:  >Within the past six months, among 100 to 150 young people under age 25, I have seen 15 to 20 percent of them making abortions without a doctor's help. They simply use household products: They drink bleach and other poisonous mixtures.  The decision to legalize the procedure, and make it simple to obtain, was almost entirely a practical decision. In 1920 they became legal if done by a doctor, essentially in acknowledgement that it would happen no matter what, so the state should do its best to make it safe. They were subsidized by the state, so free to the woman. In 1926, the abortion rate was 42.8 per 1000 working women, and 45.2 per 1000 'housewives' (compare to the US today, at 13.2 per 1000 women. Modern Russia continues to be very high, at 37.4 per 1000 or so)  But this wasn't to remain. As noted, the change was not because abortion was seen as *good*, but that legalizing it was a necessary evil and that the state would work to eliminate the underlying economic reasons driving women to have them. As it turned out, poor women were no more likely to be using this 'service though'. If anything, it was the better off women who were getting more abortions. Even worse, the birthrate in the USSR was falling precipitously, from 42.2 per 1000 in 1928 to 31.0 in 1932, according to a government study released in 1934. Thus the law changed in 1936 when policies started to return to pushing more 'traditional' gender roles for women, and included restricting abortion again - it required a medical reason now. As before though, just because it is illegal doesn't mean women don't seek them. After 1936, \"back-alley\" abortions were on the rise, and they certainly carried additional risks with them, and penalties for obtaining one meant injured women would only be further harmed by not seeking treatment:  >Women who became infected during these procedures or who sought assistance for heavy bleeding were often interrogated at the hospital before they were treated, as the authorities attempted to learn the names of underground abortionists. Abortionists were punished with one or two years\u2019 imprisonment if they were physicians and at least three if they were not. The woman herself received a reprimand for her first offense and a fine if caught again.   Abortion statistics aren't readily available for this period, but my book notes that as the birth rate didn't seem to change much - rising briefly through 1937 when it reached 39.6 per 1000 but again beginning to decline until leveling out at 33.6 per 1000 in 1940, the same rate as 1936 when the law went into effect - as the laws became restrictive again, this would imply women weren't especially deterred by the law and continued to seek them at the same rate as before (see 1926 numbers), if not higher. There was no ready access to, nor education regarding, other means of birth control (Aside from abortion as birth control, by far most common being 'coitus interruptus'), so it was really the only means of family planning available to women.   **The Catastrophe of War**  While the Soviet state had been concerned about falling birthrates in the 1930s, this was a mere drop in the bucket compared to the absolute demographic devastation experienced from 1941 to 1945, which saw not only millions of citizens killed, but most critically men killed on a far greater scale than women, creating a gender significant imbalance. In the range specifically of 'childbearing age', there was estimated to be between 10 to 15 percent more women then men, sometimes refered to as \"war widows\", not only for those who lost a husband, but also those who lost the *potential* for a husband due to that decline. The result of this was a major, if temporary, shift in Soviet policies. Although there was a broad, general trend to encourage more childbirths, the 1944 Family Law, and subsequent policies of the period, were most notable perhaps for the specific focus in encouraging this demographic of women bereft of the opportunity to find a husband to nevertheless participate in their \"patriotic duty\" of bearing children for the motherland.  Soviet propaganda campaigns to encourage motherhood predated the war even but the massive calamity of course kicked it into overdrive. Even aside from the *deaths*, during the war, there was a definite decline in the birthrate due to \"*general decline in the reproductive health of mothers, as reflected in the high rate of premature births*\", as characterized by the People\u2019s Commissar of Public Health G.A. Miterev, and Soviet leadership worked hard to try to turn that around, with their clear awareness that to see further decline would imperil the ability of the USSR to bounce back in the long term.  Programs and incentives to encourage motherhood existed, such as awards for bearing a certain number of children and various state assistance programs for both married and single mothers. It wasn't just carrots, but also sticks, most especially with the Family Law of 1944, which further penalized abortion and increasingly penalized divorce as well. The shortage of men also meant a very important shift in views regarding single motherhood and the importance of the nuclear family. While even earlier laws had provided benefits to mothers, they had been contingent on large families, with additional benefits, not to mention the medals and awards, usually restricted to mothers of seven or more children. The new landscape though required a significant shift, with Soviet authorities working to destigmatize single-motherhood by increasing state benefits they could receive *regardless* of the number of children, in comparison to their married counterparts and featuring mothers of ambiguous marital status in propaganda.  The changes also manifested in other spheres, although in some cases more tacitly. While the laws were clearly and openly designed to encourage motherhood, even for single women, that didn't make more men appear by magic to provide the other half of the equation. In the first, this simply meant that unmarried men were something of a 'prime commodity', and those not looking to settle down could find it very easy to bounce from relationship to relationship. This was helped greatly by laws which were passed to prevent single mothers from suing fathers for child support - after all, at least in theory the state was standing ready to provide full support if necessary - so even if they had several children with several women, there was little chance of being forced into a fatherly role. The state even, subtly, encouraged *married men* to have affairs with the \"war widows\", to help them along to motherhood, by tightening the divorce laws to make it harder for their irate wife to divorce them if the liaison was discovered.  \u00bc"

                "content": " The charge that Islam was an import to Africa did show up among Nation of Islam\u2019s (NOI) critics. Kwame Ture (at the time known as Stokely Carmichael) of the Black Panthers charged that \u201cIslam is not an African religion,\u201d and argued Islamic expansion was linked to the slave trade. NOI members rebutted this in different ways. The most common way was to argue on the basis of NOI\u2019s cosmology that Islam actually predated Muhammad and was connected with the creation of the Black people.  **Nation of Islam\u2019s Creation Story**  The Nation of Islam\u2019s (NOI) version of Islamic history differs quite dramatically from most historians' or popular understandings of Islamic history. NOI understood Islam to be the original religion of humanity from the beginning of time 66 trillion years ago and original humans to be Black. According to NOI\u2019s understanding, Black people had brought Islam to the Middle East, not the other way around.  According to the teachings of Elijah Mohammad, the founder of NOI, the first people were Arabic speaking Black Muslims of the Tribe of Shabazz. Earth was originally a utopia governed by a council of 24 Black Muslim scientists. This paradise was lost when an evil scientist named Yacub created white people out of experiments on the Black race. White people were understood to be devils. Islam\u2019s origins according to NOI were not actually in the Middle East or connected with Muhammad.  **Defending Islam as a Black religion**  In 1971 Edward L.X. Truitt spoke out against Carmichael\u2019s claim that Islam was not an African religion by contending that \u201cIslam is the religion of the Original people, who are Black, brown, red, and yellow descendants of the original Black Man, the maker and owner of planet earth.\u201d Thus, Islam was actually the creation of Black people. Embracing Islam for Black people was seen as a restoration of a lost heritage.  Other NOI members argued that the any effort to portray Islam as foreign to Africa was a plot to undermine NOI and Elijah Muhammad. Diogenes X. Grassal, for example, denounced any contemporary focus on African culture as a plan by white people to undermine Black men. According to Grassal, Yoruba and Swahili were inferior languages to Arabic, and Islam was the source of all Black achievement in Egypt, Arabia, Asia, and West Africa. Charles 67X denounced Black nationalists like Amiri Baraka for contending Arab Muslims had harmed Africa. 67X maintained that Islam had brought advanced civilization to Africa. NOI members often took harshly critical views towards Africa, which they believed to be primitive without the teachings of Islam.  **NOI and Moorish Science**  I have previously written on AskHistorians about the NOI\u2019s roots in the earlier Moorish Science Temple, an Islamic movement which appeared in Chicago after World War I. Like the later NOI movement, Moorish Science, was not grounded in traditional Sunni or Shia understandings of Islam or deeply concerned with the historical particulars of Islam, Muhammad, or early Islamic history in the Middle East. Both movements instead claimed that Islam was racially connected with Black Americans.  **Summary**  NOI\u2019s understanding of Islam\u2019s origins, teachings, and spread, had little to do with secular or mainstream Islamic understandings of history. For NOI, Islam was not a Middle Eastern religion, it was a Black religion, which had been associated with Black people since human beings had existed. Debates about Islamic expansion and involvement in the slave trade did not matter to NOI\u2019s sense of sacred history.

After the Battle of France had been decisively lost in 1940, the French Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud, tried and failed to convince the rest of the cabinet to evacuate the government to Algeria or Britain and continue fighting from there. Reynaud resigned rather than carry out the cabinet's desire to sue for peace, and the President (Albert Lebrun) appointed Marshall Philippe Petain (the leader of the surrender faction in the cabinet) to replace him. Petain asked Germany for an armistice, which Germany granted on terms that amounted to a surrender. Among other provisions, Northern and Western France (about 60% of Metropolitan France, including Paris) would be occupied by Germany until a final peace treaty was agreed (it never was, nor were negotiations ever begun in earnest), and France would be assessed an exorbitant fee to pay for the occupation. The rest of France (including the colonies) would remain unoccupied under the direct control of Petain's government.  Petain set up a new capital in Vichy, a small resort town in the unoccupied zone. There, the French Parliament voted itself out of existence and granted Petain dictatorial powers (ending the Third Republic and establishing what we now refer to as Vichy France). In the unoccupied zone, citizens paid their taxes as normal, except they were sent to Vichy instead of Paris. In the occupied zone, the German military and the French civilian administration had overlapping jurisdiction: the French bureaucrats still nominally worked for the government in Vichy, but they were required by the terms of the occupation to follow the policies of the occupation authorities. In the occupied zone, then, taxes were still assessed according to French law, by administrators who worked for the French government, but they operated under the direction and supervision of the German military. In practice, this supervision seemed to be relatively light: Petain's government's policies were aligned enough with German interests, and the German occupation's administrative resources were small enough, that the Germans mostly let Vichy set policy for the occupied zone. In both zones, the taxes went to Vichy, and in accordance with the armistice agreement, Vichy paid Germany the agreed-upon costs of the occupation (which were much higher than the actual costs, so Germany turned a substantial profit).  In November 1942, after Britain, America, and anti-Vichy French exile forces (\"Free France\") successfully invaded France's North African colonies (Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia), Germany executed Case Anton, occupying the remainder of Metropolitan France. The Vichy government remained in operation, however, and the French civilian administration continued running under German occupation.  Nazi-occupied Poland was divided up into two zones (plus a third zone in the East, which was annexed by the Soviet Union). Northern and Western Poland (a bit past the pre-WW1 borders of Imperial Germany) were annexed to the German Reich. They were integral parts of Germany, and were administered and taxed directly by the German government under German law and Nazi policy. The remainder of Poland was put under a special German occupation administration called the General Government, lead by a senior Nazi Party official (Hans Frank) who served as Governor-General of Poland. Frank and the other senior officials of the General Government ruled by decree, and they administered the territory mostly through imported German officials. The existing Polish civilian police were drafted into German service under German senior officers (mostly from the German civilian police) and used to help enforce the General Government's rule. The General Government collected taxes for its own internal use, and as with Vichy, they also sent a substantial portion of their revenue to Germany, officially as a reimbursement for the costs of the occupation.  **Sources:**  * Shirer, William, *The Collapse of the Third Republic*, 1969 * Mazower, Mark, *Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe*, 2008"

These are two separate questions, and they aren't as related as you might think. I'll answer them in order of complexity.  &#x200B;  1. **Why does popular culture associate unions with organized crime?**  The answer to this is fairly straightforward: because labor racketeering has historically been a major issue for the labor movement for as long as there has been organized crime. John Lewis, the former president of the United Mine Workers (1920-60), once observed that \"Labor, like Israel, has many sorrows.\" He was referring to the long history, even then, of corruption and racketeering that has plagued the American labor movement. David Dubinsky, the former president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (1932-66), called labor racketeering \"a cancer that almost destroyed the American labor movement.\"   First, some definitions. \"Labor corruption\" refers to the misuse of union office and authority for personal gain. \"Labor racketeering\" refers to labor corruption committed by or in alliance with, organized crime groups. To be clear, labor unions, and the labor union membership to be specific, are the victims of labor racketeering.   Labor racketeering really became an important revenue stream for organized crime groups with the repeal of prohibition in 1933. The International Longshoreman's Association, for example, was thoroughly corrupted in the 1950s, with union bosses forcing longshoreman to make payoffs to work, and shippers having to pay to have their cargo unloaded. If you haven't seen *On the Waterfront* with Marlon Brando, I'd recommend it, because it's a fantastic movie and a brilliant dramatization of the dynamics of labor racketeering at the ILA during this time period. It was based on Malcolm Johnson's 1949 Pulitzer Prize winning series in the *New York Sun,* \"Crime on the Labor Front.\"   Labor racketeering really received national political attention for the first time during the U.S. Senates 1950-51 Kefauver hearings. These hearings led directly to the passage of the Landrum Griffin Act in 1959, which sought to protect unions from organized crime penetration by banning persons with criminal records from union office, making embezzlement from a union a federal crime, and imposing reporting and disclosure requirements on unions, etc.   Arguably the issue captured the popular imagination during the 1960s, when Jimmy Hoffa was president of the Teamsters. He was at the apex of his powers during this time, having negotiated a National Master Freight Agreement that covered all over-the-road truck drivers in North America. Hoffa was also thoroughly corrupt, and was involved with the Mafia from the early years of his Teamster work. When Robert Kennedy became US attorney general in 1961, he made the prosecution of Hoffa his number one priority. This was successful, but Hoffa was pardoned by Nixon in 1971 and began campaigning to regain his leadership position despite his 15 year ban under the terms of his pardon. Hoffa \"disappeared\" in 1975, presumably the victim of a mob hit. Labor and the mafia were now inextricably linked in the public imagination.   This was also the apex of organized crime's influence in organized labor. Hoffa's 1964 prosecution partly involved his receipt of kickbacks in exchange for making benefit fund loans. Organized crime's plundering of union benefit funds was one of the leading factors that led Congress to pass ERISA in 1974, which gave the Department of Labor authority to investigate pension and welfare funds. In 1980, Senator Sam Nunn held hearings on the Teamsters, Longshoreman, Laborers, and Hotel and Restaurant Workers, revealing widespread looting of pension and welfare funds by labor racketeers connected to organized crime. RICO, which was enacted in 1970 to combat organized crime, began to be used to purge the racketeering influence from mobbed up unions beginning in the 1980s.   A prominent example occurred in 1988, when Rudy Guiliani, then the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, filed a civil RICO complaint against the Teamsters, the Cosa Nostra \"commission,\" twenty-six Cosa Nostra members, the Teamster's general executive board, and eighteen present and former members of the general board. The government settled the case with a consent decree, which barred the union defendants from any future involvement with the Teamsters and most importantly required the selection of three court appointed officers to oversee the union's reform. By 1998, James P. Hoffa, Jimmy Hoffa's son, ascended to the Teamster's presidency on an anticorruption platform, and by 2002 an independent commission found no indication of organized crime influence in the vast majority of previously tainted Teamster locals, and in the locals where questionable influences still existed, investigations and disciplinary proceedings were already under way.   I focused on the Teamsters because they were the most prominent example, but a similar process played out amongst all of the major labor unions in the US. Today organized crime controlled labor racketeering has largely faded into the rearview, and most labor corruption is the result of dishonest individual officials unconnected to organized crime. However, the perception of labor unions as being in bed with organized crime will take much longer to wear off, assuming that there is still an organized labor movement of any note in this country in the medium to long term. Which brings me to question number 2, which I will address in a separate post soon.

First let's address some misconceptions you pose as reasons why a moderate northerner would be hesitant to vote for Lincoln, mainly his inexperience and the \"upstart\" nature of the Republican party. It's worth noting that by 1860 Lincoln had already been active in politics for two decades as both a state legislator and later a member of the House of Reps, in addition to being a highly accomplished lawyer. The Lincoln-Douglas debates propelled him to further fame and notoriety and made him one of the leading voices in the Republican party, meaning that by the time of the election he was no stranger to politics and had been an established frontrunner for the Republican nomination for at least a year. Given that the prior non-Democratic candidates for President since the 1840's were primarily just prominent war heroes and generals (excluding Henry Clay) Lincoln actually was quite politically experienced for the time.   Next, while the \"upstart\" Republican party was relatively new in 1860, it was also the largest and best-established party in opposition to the Democrats. It had already won many Northern states in the 1856 election and controlled the House of Representatives since 1858, so it's not like you would be voting for some insurgent third party in 1860. For most Northerners it was highly likely that your current governor, if not state legislator, was already a Republican by the time 1860 rolled around.  Ok, now that I've established why a moderate Northerner would not have been voting for \"an inexperienced candidate of an upstart party,\" I'll go into the choices for President for a northern voter in 1860. There was Stephen Douglas, the northern Democrat who would in many ways be considered a moderate on the slavery issue due to his support for \"popular sovereignty\" in which the inhabitants of each state and territory would decide the issue for themselves. There was John Bell of the Constitutional Union party, which was formed for the sole purpose of trying to win the border states and prevent both secession and Lincoln's election, which had no stated policy on slavery. And finally, of course, there was Lincoln and the Republicans. Lincoln was actually considered a moderate Republican and not an abolitionist in 1860, much to the concern of many anti-slavery activists, as he only sought to prevent the further expansion of slavery despite viewing it as a moral evil.   So, there were actually three prominent Presidental nominees for a moderate northerner to vote for, none of who's platforms would have conflicted with your hypothetical voter's apathy towards slavery and opposition to abolition. If your voter did not even view slavery as against their own morality, I would say it's very possible that they would have voted for Douglas or Bell, not Lincoln. However, while slavery was the predominant issue of the time and had already lead to the collapse of one major American political party in the Whigs, Lincoln's platform and campaign was not only focused on slavery. Your voter could have been swayed by the mass-produced pamphlets extolling Lincoln's humble upbringings or found a common cause with the Republicans on the issues of raising tariffs and protecting immigrants, or agreed with Republican campaign literature that railed against the frequent graft and corruption among Democratic administrations."

                "content": " Disclaimer, I\u2019m an epidemiologist, not a historian. To answer the above question briefly, smoking was suggested as a cause of health problems for much of the first half of the 20th century, but there was a real fight in the medical literature about whether or not it could be proven as a cause of the more serious health effects. As such, smoking likely didn\u2019t seem very dangerous.    I\u2019m going to mostly stick to lung cancer rather than more common conditions, like coughing, since that\u2019s better recorded in the literature. Lung cancer was incredibly rare prior to the 20th century, so much so that in \u201c1900 only about 140 cases were known in the published medical literature\u201d (Proctor, RN 2012).  That\u2019s 140 cases ever, rather than 140 cases per year. Smoking became more commonplace towards the end of the 1800s and the first decades of the 1900s, but the increase in lung cancer took some time. By the 1920s, lung cancer was much more frequent than it used to be, and there were a variety of reasons given for this increase. Smoking was blamed, but so was asphalt dust, industrial air pollution, prior exposure to the poison gases used in WWI, or even the latent effects of the 1918 global influenza.    So while smoking was blamed, it certainly wasn\u2019t accepted as the cause of lung cancer, particularly by the medical field. Part of the reason for this was the model/concept of how causes for diseases were determined.   During the end of the 1800s and the early 1900s, the primary conceptual model for how to determine a causative relationship between a particular exposure (e.g., microbe) and a particular disease were Koch\u2019s postulates (published 1890).  There were four basic criteria that had to be met for a microbe to be a cause of some disease: 1. those with the disease must have the microbe present in their tissue; 2. The microbe has to be isolated and grown in pure culture; 3. When injected into a healthy animal, that microbe must cause the disease; and 4. You have to isolate the same microbe from the newly infected and diseased animal.   Koch\u2019s criteria for establishing a cause of a disease really break down when it comes to most environmental exposures. Often, a single exposure (like smoking) can cause many different health outcomes (lung cancer, heart disease, death), so you don\u2019t get a good one-to-one relationship like the microbe and infectious disease relationships that were being proved using Koch\u2019s postulates.   So researchers were sort of in a stage of \u201cassociation does not equal causation\u201d stage. One quote to illustrate: \u201cWhile most students of the problem of the aetiology of lung cancer admit to an association between smoking and lung cancer, some question whether this association also represents causation\u201d (Wynder, E.L. 1957)  There really needed to be an avalanche of evidence for the smoking-lung cancer causation to be proven. And there was. Chemists found cancer-causing chemicals in cigarette smoke, cell line experiments found that cigarette smoke caused damage to cells that were similar to lung cells, animal experiments found that tumors could be created by painting cigarette smoke tar onto the skin of mice, and there were several population studies of smokers and non-smokers showing increased incidence of lung cancer, heart disease, and mortality not only among smokers compared to non-smokers, but among heavier smokers compared to more casual smokers.   Even so, many in the public and even doctors were unconvinced.  \u201cIn 1954, for example, George Gallup sampled a broad swath of the US public to ask: \u2018do you think cigarette smoking is one of the causes of lung cancer, or not?\u2019 41% answered \u2018yes\u2019, with the remainder answering either \u2018no\u2019 or \u2018undecided\u2019. Even large numbers of doctors remained unconvinced. In 1960, in a poll organised by the American Cancer Society, only a third of all US doctors agreed that cigarette smoking should be considered \u2018a major cause of lung cancer\u2019. This same poll revealed that 43% of all American doctors were still smoking cigarettes on a regular basis, with occasional users accounting for another 5%. With half of all doctors smoking, it should come as no surprise that most Americans remained unconvinced of life-threatening harms from the habit.\u201d \u2013Proctor,RN 2011  The public at the time was probably used to seeing many of their peers smoking, with no apparent health effects (it takes years for these to develop), and it was a habit they likely enjoyed. Researchers were still arguing about how to go about proving causation, so for many, it probably seemed like cigarettes weren\u2019t all that bad.   It might make more sense to think about a health exposure that might be harmful today. The generation that smoked was probably very similar to our generation with regard to eating unhealthy food or not exercising, in that there were likely some observable, well-recognized drawbacks, but not enough to stop altogether. Smoking was likely known to have some downsides like coughing, but the sense that a single cigarette was dangerous just wasn\u2019t there.   Doll R, Hill AB.

                "content": " During the campaign and subsequent presidency of Nixon, much of his rhetoric revolved around two things in particular - crime and drugs/drug use. Nixon was the progenitor of the War on Drugs and even coined the term (although Reagan would supercharge it during his time in office).  Nixon's presidency is the time where academics begin to refer to a period defined by 'mass incarceration', where we started to heavily enforce and criminalize drug offences, particularly marijuana. Behind such efforts was forms of racist pandering, often seen as a backlash to the Civil Rights and Black Power movements. We can see this particularly when it comes to drug usage, as the Nixon administration sought to associate African-Americans with drug use in order to excuse the criminalization and policing of their leaders and communities. We see this in particular with the infamous quote from Nixon's top domestic advisor, John Ehrlichman:  *\"The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I\u2019m saying? We knew we couldn\u2019t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\u201d*\u00b9  Nixon himself wasn't above racial remarks either. In a taped recording, he stated in regards to marijuana legalization supporters: *\"You know, it's a funny thing, every one of the bastards that are out for legalizing marijuana are Jewish. What the Christ is the matter with the Jews, Bob? What is the matter with them?\"*\u00b2  During this time, there was even a commission appointed by Nixon to study the effects of Marijuana (as the Controlled Substances Act was being authored). However, when the commission found the cannabis use did not present a danger to society as the administration often presented, it was ignored.   Fast forwarding to Reagan, and we see the kickstarting of the conservative legal philosophy commonly known today as 'tough-on-crime'. It advocated for harsher criminal penalties for those convicted of a crimes (particularly violent crimes and drug offenses). Mandatory minimum sentences were established, forcing those convicted of a crime to have to serve a specific period of time for that crime (in the Clinton years this would be followed by 'truth in sentencing' laws that made those convicted of a crime have t serve a signficant portion (85%) of their sentence before being eligible for parole). Criminal penalties for drug offenses were increased heavily, particularly with the Drug Abuse Act of '86. This law also introduced penalties for crack cocaine possession, which were far harsher than for powder cocaine (something often regarded as a way to unfairly discriminate against African-American). This particular way of thinking in regards to crime lasted through Bush Sr.'s presidency.  From the period of 1970 to 1994, the prison population increased exponentially - from around 200,000 in 1970 to 1.5 million in 1994. Without a doubt, this trend was guided by the actions that the federal government took during this time in regards to how it handled crime, drug use and dependency, as well as race relations.

Both are important in regards to the history of drug prohibition in the U.S., and the LaGuardia Report is important especially in regards to the relationship between prohibition and racial discrimination.

                "content": " Yes, there were many varying viewpoints about abolitionism and the morality of the slave trade basically from the beginning of the Atlantic slave trade. Some became abolitionists after they witnessed the cruelty of slave trade first hand. John Newton, for example, began working as a slave trader out of Liverpool in the mid-18th century. He witnessed (and greatly profited from) the brutality of the slave trade, and described in detail his experiences aboard slave ships in his autobiography. In the late 1750s, Newton had a spiritual awakening and realized the evils of the slave trade and the great wealth being generated by Europeans and Americans at the expense of African lives. He became an Anglican priest, gave up all of his money, and became an ardent supporter of abolition of the slave trade. His description of the slave ship in his 1787 \"Thoughts upon the African Slave Trade\" is very stirring and helped galvanize support for the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade by Great Britain in 1807:   \"The heat and the smell of these rooms, when the weather will not admit of the slaves being brought upon deck, and of having their rooms cleaned every day, would be, almost, insupportable, to a person not accustomed to them. If the slaves and their rooms can be constantly aired, and they are not detained too long on board, perhaps there are not many die; but the contrary is often their lot. They are kept down, by the weather, to breathe a hot and corrupted air, sometimes for a week: this, added to the galling of their irons, and the despondency which seizes their spirits, when thus confined, soon becomes fatal.\"  Newton is more well known as the author of Amazing Grace.   There were many others who commented on the abolition of the slave trade, including people of African descent. Paul Cuffee advocated for a return to Africa for free blacks in America to escape the racism and slavery of Euro-Americans. Ouladah Equiano described the horrors of the trade in his 1787 autobiography:   \"But is not the slave trade entirely a war with the heart of man? And surely that which is begun by breaking down the barriers of virtue involves in its continuance destruction to every principle, and buries all sentiments in ruin!\"  There are a significant number of primary sources available online of people commenting against the slave trade. I suggest going to archive.org and searching \"slave trade.\" As for secondary sources, there are also many. W.E.B. Du Bois's classic \"The Suppression of the African Slave Trade to the United States of America\" is still very relevant and tediously researched. Marika Sherwood's \"After Abolition\" describes the movement to pass the 1807 and 1808 acts prohibiting the slave trade and the subsequent illegal slave trade that became increasingly cruel and profitable in the mid/late 19th century. Markus Rediker's \"The Slave Ship,\" Dale Graden's \"Disease, Resistance, and Lies,\" and Sowand\u00e9 Mustakeem's \"Slavery at Sea\" are all more recent and excellent studies of the worldwide importance of the slave trade, its abolition, and legacies."

I noticed today a post expressing irritation that \"historians\" engage in LGBTQ+ erasure by refusing to acknowledge that various historical figures (or characters from historical literature) were \"gay,\" etc.. I see posts like this a lot on reddit, and they're often reposting comments from other social media, so it seems clear there's a bunch of people out there who believe it's common that historians are participating in the problem of LGBTQ+ erasure.  Now, I know from reading this sub that:  a) Many historians are passionate about the history of sexuality and gender identity and are actively working to undo erasure in both popular conception of history and older historiography.  b) The history of sexuality and gender is complicated and it's rarely correct for a historian to simply say: \"yup, this person was gay/lesbian/trans.\" Usually, the accurate answer is a lot more nuanced than applying a modern label, and sometimes \"we can't really know how they identified or who they slept with\" is true even if it's frustrating.  I'm sure it irritates actual historians that they get blamed for erasure when they contribute a lot to undoing erasure. But, it seems that those contributions aren't reaching a lot of people, and I'm sympathetic to the frustration expressed in these posts even if the blame is misplaced. If the nuanced answer *feels like* erasure, then something went wrong in the educational attempt even if it's the most accurate answer.  I'd like to know if historians have strategies for communicating that nuance while avoiding creating feelings of erasure.\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " What a great question! Though it is one traditionally outside of my wheelhouse in food history, I just finished up some writing on issues of ancient gender roles and sexuality, so I\u2019m going to do my best to answer this by looking at the limited context of how scholars have discussed this in the context of ancient Greece and Rome.   Some added context to my answer: I am a lesbian. I do not study LGBT history, but I certainly understand what\u2019s at stake in the ways people represent and discuss sex and sexuality in the past and the ancient world. The thing is, there\u2019s no one \u201cright\u201d way to address there, and there is certainly no scholarly consensus on when you can or cannot apply an anachronistic label like \u201cgay\u201d onto a historic actor. Historians use anachronistic terms all the time: there are several works, for example, on colonialism and imperialism in Ancient Rome, but neither of those words existed in Ancient Rome. I\u2019d argue (and this is an argument, and there are scholars out there who disagree) that this is perfectly permissible. It is fine to define and explain the use of anachronistic terms for descriptive reasons. For this reason, I follow the lead of scholars who think it\u2019s okay to use words like \u201cgay\u201d to describe actions and acts, as \u201chomosexual\u201d has the unintended impact of medicalizing your subject, which I think it worse than using an anachronistic term (and, for that matter, homosexual is an anachronistic term).   To really score the sense of debate on the topic, I\u2019m going to quickly address the work of two scholars who have written on the idea of whether or not a history of sexuality exists, and how scholars should treat that. David Halperin, a well regarded classicist who studies ancient sexuality, argued in his \u201cIs There a History of Sexuality?\u201d that there is not, because sexuality as we understand it (as an essential characteristic of the self) is a relatively recent invention. Non-normative sexual relationships did form in the ancient world especially, where men had sex with other men. There was a whole complicated typology of terminology. An classicist (whose name I don\u2019t bring up because he is in federal prison on child porn charges) wrote a relevant article \u201cThe Teratogenic grid,\u201d that explains the different roman terms attached to different active and passive sexual positions with respect to different orifices. Was a Cinadeus, a man who was the passive participant in anal sex, gay, because he had gay sex? Halperin views such a scholarly imposition as anachronistic in part because of the lack of any organized self-concept attached to it. I think it\u2019s relevant here to mention that Halperin himself is a gay man, and has been openly gay for his career. Some contemporary audiences might view this as a form of erasure, but I think it\u2019s clearly more complicated than that.   Obviously, there are many scholars who disagree with Halperin, and the contemporary consensus is far more nuanced, thought many scholar especially of ancient sex and sexuality I have found are still touchy about calling any ancient figure \u201cgay\u201d \u201cLesbian\u201d or \u201cbisexual,\u201d because the sources we have simply don\u2019t illuminate much about their own self concept. John Boswell disagrees with the essential idea that something (ie, being gay) only exists when society gives a name or explanation to that identity, and identifies places in ancient texts where preference, and not simply action, are expressed. And on a more basic and theoretical level, many gay people (myself included) would tell you that we would be able to comprehend our experience and our difference even in the absence of the descriptive language of today\u2019s LGBT movement.   This seems to be where most scholars today settle, and who tend to avoid the erasure trap you bring up. Though it is still easier to speak in abstracts here, about ideas of sex and sexuality, versus about individual people. I tend to think biography is a different beast entirely, thought many people tend to synonymize it with all types of history. Even scholars who embrace these expansive conceptual ideas might hesitate to apply them when writing about the life of an ancient figure whose life is only recorded through rumor and hearsay. By all means, describe their actions, describe what we do know, but historians writing scholarship has an obligation to their sources and to the truth. Do not use euphemisms like friendship where your subject used words like \u201clove,\u201d but seek to understand that in context. Write about affairs, romances, sexual relationships, etc, with honesty and the best description you have, but scholarly arguments are rarely about whether someone was gay or not. That detail should not be the focus, or the only part, or a biography.    An interesting a case study that I think is illuminating here: was Sappho a lesbian? Can we call Sappho a lesbian? I find that when I see people discussing this and historian erasure, Sappho\u2019s name appears fairly often, supposedly as one of few examples of women who loved other women in the ancient world. Also, both our terms \u201clesbian\u201d and \u201csapphic\u201d come from her. Certainly, scholars must be engaging in erasure to deny her homosexuality? Obviously it is far more complicated than this, and scholars react in different ways inside and outside of the academy. We have almost no information about Sappho. We have a handful of fragments, some of which express love and affection for other women. But the Brothers poem, some of the longest fragments we have, discusses nothing of the sort. Sappho\u2019s \u201chusband\u201d whose name basically translates to Dick Allcock of man island, doesn\u2019t poke any meaningful holes in this theory but. Again. We know so little about her that it\u2019s difficult to say anything about her with certainty.   But that lack of certainty does not mean we should look away from the question of get on people\u2019s case when they call her a lesbian or when queer women say they ID with her poetry. This eidolon article Re-queering Sappho suggests that academic rigor can live alongside a more easy going identification. Seeing yourself reflected in the past can be a good thing\u2014 and while its important to understand those limitations falter, I don\u2019t think its historic to allow scholars to loosen these restrictions in public writing, as many scholars seem to.   So to answer the question, I think the best way I can think to solve this problem is simply distinguish between academic scholarship, where language must be more precise, and yes, constrained, and public scholarly work or other artistic engagements with a figure. I think there is room for both, and I think it\u2019s important to distinguish between scholarly engagement with ancient sexuality and erasure because we don\u2019t use the terminology people want. These issues are fraught, and lots of well meaning scholars have taken different perspectives, some of which I find more limiting. These questions are more difficult, especially in the ancient world, than people realize, given the proliferation of memes about how gay the greeks were etc, . There\u2019s a lot more to say about this, but hopefully some people with more expertise than I can help fill in the holes here."

However, after seeing it in person, he is sickened and furious and much more enthusiastic about his mission to hinder the slave trade, and to make his point he treats the captured vessel as described.

                "content": " As the OP says, in this case, there's some of O'Brian's usual work to reference the historical backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars.   In this case, Aubrey's first mission to interdict the slave trade is actually chronologically appropriate. The novel *The Commodore* takes place in 1812, five years after Great Britain had abolished the Atlantic slave trade in 1807. The United Kingdom would not abolish slavery in its colonial possessions until 1833.   From 1808 onward, the Royal Navy was empowered to overtake and capture ships in the Atlantic with slaves on board, returning any slaves captured in the process to West Africa, most frequently Freetown in Sierra Leone but also as the 19th Century went on, to St. Helena, Cape Town, Lagos and other British-controlled ports in West Africa.   Other Atlantic powers abolished the Atlantic slave trade within a few years of the British decision--the United States also in 1807, Portugal in 1810, France in 1814. This created a complicated series of treaty agreements covering the activities of the \"anti-slavery squadron\" of the Royal Navy over the course of the 19th Century, which sometimes kept British naval officers from acting against a particular ship. Just to give a sense of how complicated it all was, Portugal's commitments on the slave trade in 1810 allowed Portuguese ships to trade in slaves from Portuguese-controlled outposts, just not in outposts controlled by other European nations or in territories controlled by West African sovereigns. When Spain signed a treaty on the slave trade, it only committed to abolition north of the equator. Essentially the British most of the time could only interfere with a ship that had slaves already on board--ships that were equipped for the trade but with no cargo had to be left alone. Captains involved in the Atlantic slave trade also looked for ways to avoid the Royal Navy's activities either by having faster ships (\"Baltimore clippers\") or by procuring slaves in other locations than the dominant West and Central African slaving ports of the late 18th Century, including a brief period of intense slave-trading activity in East Africa.   In the period of time that this novel takes place (keeping in mind how fluid time sometimes is in the Aubrey-Maturin books), Aubrey would have been interdicting slavers before some of the treaty framework was fully established, and just slightly before the first significant operations of the Royal Navy, but after the 1807 and 1810 agreements. So while Aubrey's operations in the novel are a bit bigger in scope than is historically accurate for that precise time, it's still within shouting distance--there was already a commander of the West Africa Squadron in 1808.   Aubrey's attitudes as described by the OP are essentially necessary for the characterization established by O'Brian. Aubrey and Maturin are meant to be basically benevolent and palatable to modern audiences--they have more \"period\" personality than a purely cartoonish figure like Horatio Hornblower and more roundedness, but if Aubrey remained indifferent to enslavement in the course of his duties in this novel, it would make contemporary readers fairly uncomfortable. So Aubrey's reactions are rather histrionic and exaggerated and yet not strongly implausible. (Maturin's abolitionism is consistent with his character and very much in line with sentiments that existed in 1812.)  Sentiment about slavery among the British elite and groups who were at the edges of their social world (e.g., people like Aubrey and Maturin) was shifting rapidly in the early 19th Century. Olaudah Equiano (aka Gustavus Vassa) published his autobiography of his enslavement and manumission in England in 1789--it was a gigantic bestseller in the UK. In the 1790s, attempts to abolish the slave trade were soundly defeated in Parliament, but William Wilberforce's continued efforts for abolition won more and more support in the lead-up to the passage of the 1807 Act. (Nelson's devotees claim he had no particular views of slavery, but he was friendly with plantation owners and was at least once very dismissive of Wilberforce and his allies.) By the 1820s-1830s, moral opposition to the slave trade was fairly established within polite society in Britain and was an important part of Nonconformist religious evangelism.   What is more interesting is that the last twenty years of historical scholarship on maritime life in the late 18th and 19th Century Atlantic has made clear that many Atlantic crews--including Royal Navy crews--were multiracial and included people who had escaped from slavery as well as sailors who had participated in slave voyages and had come to feel great opposition to the trade subsequently. Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker's pathbreaking *The Many-Headed Hydra* is a terrific window into this maritime world. (O'Brian's books were written substantially before much of this new research, so his characterization of maritime life doesn't fully tap into this new historical picture.)  So you could imagine a slightly different version of Aubrey's expedition where some of his reaction to slavery followed from being a part of that milieu. Moreover, by the early 19th Century, when the Atlantic slave trade had been at its most intense peak for several decades, slave ships were built in highly specialized ways to contain as many slaves as possible in profoundly miserable conditions and were also fortified on deck against possible slave revolts. (Rediker's *The Slave Ship* provides a horrifying and depressing look at how slave ships actually operated.) It's fairly consistent with Aubrey's attitude towards naval service and maritime life that he might find his first actual up-close inspection of a slaving ship deeply revolting and a perversion of life at sea.   However, because of treaty obligations, in general Royal Navy officers had to be careful to follow legal guidelines in inspecting slave ships and taking them as prizes--eventually there were multiple naval courts designed to ensure that everything was done properly. So Aubrey sinking a slave ship out of rage is a bit Hollywood, yes."

                "content": " I have a few earlier answers regarding the ancient and medieval European world, if you're interested!  ~  * **On silphium, the famed, extinct ancient birth control drug**  From late antique (and earlier/later) medical authorities, we hear about Cyrenaic sap/root and silphium as ingredients in contraceptive/abortifacient recipes--presumed to be the same plant, since silphium was always noted to grow only in a small habitat range outside Cyrene. Modern scholars have concluded it was probably a variety of, or related to, fennel.  And yes, medical writers often note that it was extremely effective, and that it was extinct or almost extinct by the time Republic became Empire.  I think the thing to remember here, though, is how ridiculously rare and expensive silphium had to have been. If it really only grew inside a small radius around Cyrene and was impossible to cultivate (report some writers), I don't see how enough of it could possibly have grown and been picked to be accessible to the vast majority of women in ancient Rome who wanted it. And how can any medicine be effective if you can't use it?  ~  * **How did sex workers in brothels not get pregnant in medieval times?**  Surely some medieval sex workers, both those in brothels and those working on a temporary or contingency basis, did get pregnant. Court records from early 16C London, for example, might explicitly note that a woman initially sentenced to dunking in the Thames for sex work was ultimately spared \"being with child.\" It also seems to be the case that brothel keepers may have helped new mothers dispose of their children.  Nevertheless, medieval medical authorities held that sex workers were infertile thanks to the extra dirt that built up in their wombs, which does suggest sex workers developed rough methods of contraception. We know some women specialized in providing abortifacient herbs. In one 16th century German case, a former sex worker, even, was known to supply other women with herbs to, in the circumlocution of the court records, restore their monthly menstruation.  Ruth Mazo Karras, one of the most important scholars on prostitution in the Middle Ages, suggested one other option that subsequent scholars have generally agreed with. John Rykener is a rare case of a cross-dressing man charged with prostitution. In his own court testimony, he reported that none of his (male) customers had any idea he was actually male. That suggests that sex workers had some sway with their clients in offering non-vaginal sex for sale. (ETA way later: I should add that P.J.P. Goldberg has argued that the case of John Rykener is a literary fabrication created for political ends).  Additionally, I need to mention one archaeological dig at Ashkelon in the Near East. This is a Roman bathhouse where the skeletons of many infants--born alive but dying shortly after birth--have been found in one of the drains. Archaeologists have posited that this bathhouse was the site of prostitution if not an outright brothel, and the dead infants were the victims of necessary infanticide. /u/kookingpot might be willing to say more about the dig and the various theories that have been proposed to explain the troubling evidence.  ~  * **I'm a well regarded sex worker in ancient Rome with a solid clientele, and have just realised that I'm pregnant. What are my options?**  \"Patchwork families.\"  I love Ann-Cathrin Harders' term for it, and I should've thought to include it in my recent answer on single mothers in medieval Europe. One of the most important things it shows is: **contraception and infanticide were not the only option.**  With such messy and depressing mortality rates in the ancient and medieval world--and we're not just talking about death in childbirth here, which was less common than you probably think--even wealthy children had a strong chance of losing their father by mid-adolescence. A family which the father *possessed* was certainly the ideal, but it was by far not a given.  If we're talking about \"well-regarded\" sex workers, which I interpret as \"with more resources,\" I think **single mothers** is a good model to start with, especially regarding children once born. Roman sexual relationships were already more fluid than we might think of today, and children born out of wedlock were common enough to have a single word designating them in law: *spurii*. (Which, as the root of our \"spurious,\" does not have the best of connotations today.)  Women in the ancient and medieval worlds often cultivated a strong network of female family and friends. It was to them that single mothers tended to turn. Essentially adoptive mothers, stepmothers, aunts and uncles raising children--this was not the *norm*, but it was *normal*.   Hence Harders' \"patchwork families,\" with the emphasis on *families*.  Would sex workers be treated any differently after giving birth to a child? ...Why would they?  **A second option was, indeed, abortion.** Many, *many* recipes for contraceptives and abortifacients are presented in classical medical texts--all the herbal combinations you could want. John Riddle, one of the major scholars working on birth control and abortion in ancient and medieval Europe, even suggests that some may have had at least a slight impact on the probability of preventing pregnancy or producing an abortion.   Three problems, though: literacy, access to texts, and access to ingredients.  ...On the other hand, contraceptives and abortifacients tend to be recipes--whether or not the same ones recorded exclusively by men--passed down or provided by other *women* as oral tradition.  **And then there is That Topic in scholarship**, the one where scholars go round and round in circles: infanticide.  As /u/kooking_pot discusses in this thread, archaeological evidence from Ashkelon can easily be interpreted as demonstrating a common practice of infanticide. Also not Pompeii, but in the Roman Empire (England), some scholars have suggested that a burial site containing the bodies of 97 babies demontrates systematic infanticide as well. Significantly for our purposes, the general assumption by these scholars is that the burial site/cemetery marks a brothel. Other scholars, Dominic Wilkinson points out, simply see a burial site for infants whose bodies were buried, not cremated.  There is plenty of strong evidence, however, to show that some women certainly left their children \"exposed\"--but not necessarily in our view of the little baby on the mountaintop torn apart by wolves. Rome, at least, even had specific locations for parents or their delegates to leave babies they could not or would not raise--think of our Safe Spaces today, even. W.V. Harris points out that the intention was typically rescue, not death, if you consider that infants were often even clothed.  And in literature (which albeit is, well, literature), these babies are indeed often rescued.  **So, as an ancient Roman sex worker with some financial resources who found herself pregnant, a woman had real choices for her body, and perhaps later for her baby.**  ~  I hope this helps!"

I saw a couple minutes of a history channel piece about a pharaoh's tomb, and it mentioned that near the entrance there was a ramp leading downward that would come to a sudden pit in the floor with no ladder built into it, and the idea was that it would keep rain water from flooding the tomb and also trap anyone who was attempting to steal from the tomb unprepared.

(NB: False walls weren't intended to serve the same purpose as false doors, which had a spiritual purpose that anyone with a passing familiarity of Egyptian eschatology would have known about.) Failing that, the tombs of people from wealthy families sometimes had armed guards, although naturally this was only so long as the family could continue to pay for them. But memories fade over time, and IIRC most successful tomb robberies were committed against people who had died outside of living memory. One of the working theories in Egyptology is that robberies committed within a few years after the actual burial might have been managed with assistance from the tomb's architects and builders, who would certainly have known how to circumvent the thickest walls and doors (and may even have built a not-so-obvious passage for easier access).  However, stuff like *Indiana Jones* would be a stretch. It's very unlikely that elaborate trap mechanisms could survive hundreds, much less thousands, of years waiting for the first unwary archaeologist to happen across them, and then there's the question of who would reset or rebait a trap after it had been triggered. The hail of poison darts that greets Indiana in *Raiders of the Lost Ark* would long since have rotted away unless someone were replacing them constantly, although it's far more likely that the temple complex -- most of which appears to be underground -- would have been rendered impassable by tree roots, if not collapsed outright.  **China:** The closest I've seen any archaeological dig come to genuine \"This place is legitimately dangerous thousands of years later\" territory is the tomb of Qin Shi Huang. You may know his tomb better as the site with the thousands of terracotta warriors, but an old legend is that his tomb was surrounded by a moat of liquid mercury in a nod to the ancient belief that mercury could bestow immortality. Ironically, the constant ingestion of mercury due to this belief is how Qin may have died, but soil samples taken from portions of the tomb (not all of it has been excavated -- actually, most of it probably hasn't been) show extremely elevated mercury levels."

But the obvious answer is fifth/sixth- century Britain. It starts off with Britain as (mostly) a diocese of the Roman Empire (a collection of provinces) and then almost no written sources for over two hundred years and when the narrative history can be resumed the bulk of the island is divided up into kingdoms who seem to belong to an ethnic group (the Anglo-Saxons) who weren't even noted in Britain previously, the formerly-Roman British aren't speaking Latin and the savage raiding Irish have become a nation of (still reasonably savage) Christian saints. It's great if you like speculative history, but it's a period when we'll likely never know what happened.  That said, the lack of information is explicable. Roman Britain was not actually well-documented: in 1981 it was actually only possible to identify a handful of Roman governors in Britain (there were four or five provinces requiring a governor every few years) during the entire fourth century, and I doubt the picture has changed much in this respect in the last 40 years. Most of what we know about Roman Britain actually is a result of it being part of the wider Roman world, which took notice if barbarians invaded or usurpers were declared emperor, so at least mentioned these things: the authors writing about Britain were not in Britain but much closer to the Mediterranean heartlands of the Empire.  Indeed, there's a lovely irony that the fifth century sees the first written works by men who seem to have come from Britain: Pelagius, Maximus of Riez and St Patrick (who is the only one to actually confirm his birthplace was Britain). Unfortunately they all wrote outside of Britain, and were focused on church matters, so we have Britons contributing written sources whilst the history of their homeland goes dark."

However, you have to understand that \"religion\" is a very vague and limited term that does not really have a clear definition, and whether it is or isn't used to describe a given phenomenon is more a matter of power and legitimacy than of analysis. \"Religion\" always functioned in contrast with other, lesser things, such as \"superstition\" or \"magic\". In the colonial era, Europeans had \"religion\", and if the people they interacted with had comparable things (such as a sacred text), they too had \"religion\" -- but if your traditions were orally transmitted, for example, you had \"primitive superstition\".  Now on to Christian religion / Norse mythology. \"Norse religion\" is as sayable as \"Christian religion\", but mythology specifically refers to a body of myths, i.e., narratives. A Norse sacrifice to Odin would be \"Norse religion\", but it would not be Norse mythology.  (EDIT: and there's a lot of grey area here. Are fairy tales mythology? They concern spirit creatures like gnomes and fairies... Is a story only mythology if it is about a god? Then, what's a god?)  However, you can already see the workings of power and legitimacy in this comparison - while we may speak of Norse religion for a Norse ritual, it would offend many to speak of \"Christian mythology\" for a Bible story.  Words like \"Greek mythology\" or \"Norse mythology\" also generally imply far more cohesion and stasis than the Greek and Norse contexts actually had. For Greece we know more than Norse religion, but Greek myths have incredible variety and dynamism throughout different area's and time periods in Greece. Gods and stories about them would constantly change. For example, Aphrodite is not originally a Greek goddess -- she was a Phoenician goddess \"imported\" by Phoenician traders, who the Greeks adopted into their system. (This \"adopting\" of different gods, which is utterly alien to the modern day concept of \"religion\", also points to how different they thought about gods and worship compared to modern day Christians and modern day post-Christian seculars). The idea of \"Greek mythology\" is very much a modern day edited collection that erases the multiplicity of actual ancient Greek religion.  TL;DR comparing \"Christian religion\" and \"Norse mythology\" is a bit like comparing apples and oranges; or more fittingly, comparing apple trees with oranges."

One window into the SF-nerd response to *Galactica*\u2019s premiere is via the magazine *Starlog* (fair warning- Archive.org has the entire print run digitized here - I\u2019m not responsible for time lost down this internet rabbit hole!). Staffed by some hardcore American SF fans and launching in the mid-1970s, *Starlog* was one of the major mainstream sources of information about SF and fantasy media. The magazine ran episode guides, interviews with cast and crew, special effects layouts, and other material not commonly available. Letters to the editor not only weighed in on the merits of various movies, but also asked such minutia like whether or not Patrick McNee did *Battlestar*\u2019s voiceover (he didn\u2019t) or what was the main unit of measurement used in the series. *Starlog*\u2019s main articles could veer into uncritical fluff. For example, one of the issues mentioned below excitedly reports that Star Wars coming to television screens soon in a holiday special complete with photos of Lumpy and the other Wookies celebrating Life Day. Nonetheless, the magazine\u2019s editors and commentators could strike an occasionally critical tone and *Battlestar* was not immune to this occasional censure.  *Starlog*\u2019s editor in chief Howard Zimmerman\u2019s column \u201cLast Word,\u201d was decidedly critical of the pilot and initial episodes in Issue 019. Zimmerman wrote:  >It\u2019s hard to decide whether my basic reaction to ABC\u2019s *Battlestar Galactica* is anger or incredulity; I guess it\u2019s equal parts of both. At the time I write this, the first six hours of the show have aired: the initial three-hour movie, a two-hour film broken into two parts, and one hour-long episode. I\u2019ve seen more than enough. The three-hour premiere suffered from script and film editing problems and an overall sense of confusion. So many lines and scenes raised my hackles that I can\u2019t go into them all.  After raising up a few plot holes, Zimmerman notes \u201cthe sad truth is that the plot inconsistencies are only part of the problem. There is no science background in the show whatsoever.\u201d He concluded his editorial by noting that while *Star Trek* started out as a \u201c*Wagon Train* to the stars,\u201d the show managed to transcend this limitation when \u201cthe role of the *science officer* was expanded [emphasis original,\u201d and its scripts explored legitimate SF concepts.   While Zimmerman\u2019s critique was harsh, he did hold up hope that *Battlestar* could live up to *Star Trek*\u2019s success. David Gerrold, one of *Star Trek*\u2019s writers, did not see much potential in *Battlestar*. In his column \u201cHope-The Human Challenge,\u201d in Issue 026 which was written after the news of *Battlestar*\u2019s cancellation broke, Gerrold noted that the reason both *Battlestar* and its British contemporary *Space:1999* failed directly reflects the reasons for *Star Trek*\u2019s enduring popularity: hope in humanity\u2019s future. Both the cancelled shows showed humanity with its back against the wall amidst a hostile universe, which he contended made these shows not  reflection of the future, but instead a reflection of the malaise of the 1970s. Gerrold contends that:  >The premise[in *Battlestar*] is even less honorable: \u201cThey\u2019re after us! Let\u2019s run like hell!\u201d Perhaps this is why *Battlestar Galactica* has been cancelled. When the viewing audience began to realize these people were not going to find a place to stand and fight back, they lost interest. Who can really care about a show that has cowardice as a part of its basic format? That one simple change, perhaps- letting these survivors find a planet and fight to defend it- might have been enough to save the show. At the very least, it would have provided a reason to care about these people. And that reason would have been called *hope* [Emphasis original].  Both Zimmerman and Gerold damned with faint praise *Battlestar*\u2019s expensive special effects (which were extensively covered in various *Starlog* issues), but warned that effects were no substitute for story, and used *Star Trek* as a benchmark example.   Of course, not all of *Starlog*\u2019s readers agreed with these critical assessments. Zimmerman \u201cLast Word,\u201d in Issue 020 remarked that \u201cMy last editorial on this space opera prompted many readers to write highly emotional letters in defense of the show.\u201dSome of the published letters took issue with Zimmerman\u2019s excessive criticism. Tom Sorlie\u2019s letter in Issue 021 argues that \u201c*Battlestar Galactica* isn\u2019t the only show with faults. All shows have faults. (Yes, even *Trek* has mistakes, trekkies!)\u201d Other letters, while not mentioning *Battlestar*, complained that *Starlog* had a clear pro-*Trek* bias that colored its coverage of new SF. Despite this defense, Zimmerman\u2019s critique of *Battlestar* struck a chord with some readers. Mark Shepherd\u2019s letter in Issue 21 attacked Glen Larson\u2019s privileging of spectacle over substance:  > .There is one fact that is glaring and certainly one of the wonders of Hollywood \u2014 the (*Galactica*) scripts. Granted Glen Larson wanted to do  the job solo, but, er, Glen, it just isn't working. How nice it would indeed be to have culled mainstream writers into this from the start. Consider: The script is the most important element in the world of visuals, and on TV it is the cheapest to come by. Low man on the totem pole is the screenwriter. The smallest part of the budget\u2026  While *Starlog*\u2019s editorial and reader letters are not a comprehensive source about fandom\u2019s response to *Battlestar Galactica*, it was one of the major SF publications of the era. Some clear *Star Trek* partisans like Zimmerman compared Larson\u2019s creation to Roddenberry\u2019s and found the former quite lacking. Not every reader of *Starlog* agreed with this negative assessment, as evidence by letters defending the show and the simple fact that *Starlog* continued to run positive articles on *Battlestar*\u2019s actors and special effects as well as advertisements for official *Battlestar* merchandise well after the show\u2019s cancellation became common knowledge. This suggests that despite their editor\u2019s misgivings about the show, the magazine\u2019s owners still believed that *Starlog*\u2019s readers still desired information about their now-cancelled show."

Best to start afresh and just answer the main question: 'what would Jesus have considered the year to be?'  The answer is that in the Roman province of Syria during Jesus' time the standard practice was to refer to years by the regnal year of the Roman emperor.  New year in the Syrian calendar corresponded to 1 October in the Julian calendar, so when Tiberius took the emperorship in August 14 CE, that was the start of 'Tiberius 1'. Two months later, in October, began 'Tiberius 2'.  So for example the most popular ancient choice for the date Jesus died, spring 29 CE, would have been 'Tiberius 16', which began in October 28 CE.   You can in fact see this system being used at one point in the New Testament: *Luke* 3.1-3 puts Jesus' baptism and the start of his ministry in 'the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar's reign'. As a backup it also lists a number of local contemporary rulers and a magistrate.  As in my other post, I recommend E. J. Bickerman's Chronology of the ancient world (2nd ed. 1980) as a guide to these matters.

                "content": " Oh hey, something I\u2019ve done research on! I will try to answer this from the Roman perspective. \r   \r   It\u2019s true that Roman gods, to some extent, had certain domains with which they were associated. However, you\u2019re right to be skeptical that it\u2019s as simple as saying that Jupiter was the \u201cgod of thunder\u201d, Juno the \u201cgoddess of marriage\u201d, Pluto the \u201cgod of the dead\u201d, and so on. \r   \r\r   Jupiter did indeed have powers over the sky, but this is just one aspect of what made Jupiter, Jupiter. Another aspect we might look to is the extent to which his worship, and the symbols involved, were seen as relating to the power of the Roman state. The chief priest (\u201c*pontifex maximus*\u201d, a title which has since been claimed by centuries of Popes to the modern day) was a priest of Jupiter. The scepter (*sceptrum*), a symbol of power, was associated with Jupiter (Festus, *De verborum significatione*, 210). When victorious Roman generals led their army in a procession (a triumph) through the city, they wore purple regalia and their faces painted red to embody Jupiter, and their parade ended with them going to the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus (\u201cJupiter the Best and Greatest\u201d) on the Capitoline Hill, a temple he shared with his wife, Juno, and his daughter, Minerva. When consuls (the two chief magistrates) came into office every year, they sacrificed an ox to Jupiter and his will could be discerned through the body parts of the sacrifice \u2013 such as the liver, which Livy mentions as having vanished from one year\u2019s ox, a bad omen (Livy, *Ab urbe condita*, 41.14.7). \r   \r   From these we can see that a large part of Jupiter\u2019s function within the Roman pantheon was as the king of the gods, who could grant legitimacy to the Roman state. In short, to call Jupiter a \u201cgod of thunder\u201d is technically not incorrect, but is quite an oversimplification that misses the nuances of function and meaning associated with his cult in the context of Roman public religion. If you really wanted to simplify things, you would probably be better served thinking of Jupiter as the god who represented the legitimate power of the Roman state rather than as the \u201cgod of thunder\u201d. This better reflects his function as a public cult deity. \r   \r   On top of this, another characteristic of Roman religion was the idea of gods having different aspects. Jupiter, being a rather powerful and important god, was worshipped all over the empire, but in different towns (and even within the city of Rome itself) one might find multiple versions of Jupiter. This can also be said of other public cult deities, such as Mars. Augustus had a temple dedicated to him, or more specifically to Mars Ultor (\u201cMars the Avenger\u201d) no doubt as a message to the Roman public that he had avenged his adoptive father Caesar\u2019s death at the hands of Brutus and his friends. Also in Rome is the Temple of Venus Genetrix (\u201cVenus the Founder\u201d, i.e., of the Julian family; the Julii claimed to be descended from Venus). The different aspects of gods were rather useful for imperial propaganda. \r   \r   Going back to Jupiter himself, there was also a Temple of Jupiter Stator (\u201cJupiter the Sustainer\u201d) in the Campus Martius (\u201cField of Mars\u201d, in the northwest part of the city). His wife, Juno, in addition to being represented in the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, could also be found as Juno Moneta (\u201cJuno the Warner\u201d) guarding the state\u2019s funds in her temple, also on the Capitoline. (The association between Juno Moneta and the state treasury is a likely explanation for the modern day \u201cmonetary\u201d, \u201cmoney\u201d, etc.). \r   \r   Though ostensibly the same god, one temple in one part of Rome, or in another city of the empire, could house within it the worship of Jupiter, Juno, or any other public cult deity in one of many different guises. In fact, some historians have argued that public religion was so tied to civic identity (in other words, the worship of the gods in localized forms was so tied to each individual city or town) that the attempts of emperors like Decius in the 3rd century AD to enforce a more coherent and consistent religious identity were doomed to failure (Rives 1995). It\u2019s worth noting that a fundamental characteristic of ancient religion was its diversity. Indeed, it\u2019s become common among historians of Roman religion to speak not of \u201ca Roman religion\u201d but of plural \u201cRoman religions\u201d which were never really brought together until the rise of Christianity, which concerns itself much more with orthodoxy.    \\[Part 1/3\\]"

That commitment is why we offer Rules Roundtables on a regular basis, why we post explanations when removing answers when we can, and why we send dozens of modmails a week in response to questions from users looking for feedback or clarity. Behind the scenes, there is an incredible amount of conversation among the team about modding decisions and practices and we work hard to foster an environment that both adheres to the standards we have achieved in this community and is safe and welcoming to our users.  One of the ways we try to accomplish this is by having a few, carefully crafted and considered zero-tolerance policies. For example, we do not tolerate racist, sexist, homophobic, ableist, or antisemitic slurs in question titles and offer users guidance on using them in context and ask for a rewrite if there\u2019s doubt about usage. We do not tolerate users trying to doxx or harass members of the community. And we do not tolerate genocide denial.   At times, genocide denial is explicit; a user posts a question challenging widely accepted facts about the Holocaust or a comment that they don\u2019t think what happened to Indigenous Americans following contact with Europeans was a genocide. In those cases, the question or comment is removed and the user is permanently banned. If someone posts a question that appears to reflect a genuine desire to learn more about genocide, we provide them a carefully written and researched answer by an expert in the topic. But at other times, it\u2019s much less obvious than someone saying that a death toll was fabricated or that deaths had other causes. Some other aspects of what we consider genocide denial include:  * Putting equal weight on people revolting and the state suppressing the population, as though the former justifies the latter as simple warfare * Suggesting that an event academically or generally considered genocide was \u201cjust\u201d a series of massacres, etc. * Downplaying acts of cultural erasure considered part of a genocide when and if they failed to fully destroy the culture  Issues like these can often be difficult for individuals to process as denial because they are often parts of a dominant cultural narrative in the state that committed the genocide. North American textbooks for children, for instance, may downplay forced resettlement as simply \u201cmoving away\u201d. Narratives like these can be hard to unlearn, especially when living in that country or consuming its media.  When a question or comment feels borderline, the mod who notices it will share it with the group and we\u2019ll discuss what action to take. We\u2019ve recently had to contend with an uptick in denialist content as well as with denialist talking points coming from surprising sources, including members of the community. We have taken the appropriate steps in those cases but feel the need to reaffirm our strong stance against denial, even the kind of soft denial that is frequently employed when it comes to lesser known instances of genocide, such as \u201cit happened during the course of a war\u201d or \u201cbecause disease was involved no campaign of extermination took place.\u201d  We once again want to reaffirm our stance of zero tolerance for the denial of historical atrocities and our commitment to be open about the decisions we, as a team of moderators, take.

                "content": " Your question is global, which would require a global answer. I'm an Americanist, so that's what I'm competent to answer on. /u/nilhaus has already given a good take, but I'm going to come at it from a little different angle. American slavery is something that white people do mostly to black people and on a usually smaller scale to Native Americans. I can't speak to the second category of slavery at all, but the first is my wheelhouse.   It's true that the first abolitionists in this field are black people, both in their capacities resisting enslavement for themselves and in their joint activity to undermine it. They're not powerless under slavery  but with the exception of Haiti, they do lack the power to abolish it. That's a privilege that white people reserved to themselves and they were not in any rush.  By the second half of the seventeenth century, slavery is consolidated and increasingly codified by law in Britain's North American colonies. What Winthrop Jordan calls the double perpetuities become the norm: a person is enslaved forever and their children are also enslaved forever. The situation before that is much more complicated and unclear due to ambiguous and scant records, but it looks like the law followed the reality on the ground rather than established it. That said, the transplanted Englishmen in North America (with the important exception of some South Carolinians) did not have experience back home with slavery. They certainly knew *of* it, but lacked a recent record of practice. They worked it out as they went.  Until the system solidifies, there doesn't seem to be much white resistance to it. As it does, that emerges. The first signpost here is Samuel Sewall's *The Selling of Joseph*, a pamphlet he published in Massachusetts in 1700. Sewall's objections are not taken up, but through the first half of the eighteenth century there are isolated church protests and debates about the morality of slavery. Religious uneasiness about the institution is probably strongest among Quaker and Methodist denominations, but even within them it's often checked by a more conservative mainstream.  Things shift as the imperial crisis heats up in the middle of the century. The colonists denounce the thing the British are doing to them as reducing them to slavery, which indicates that they understand slavery as something bad and wrong. They had done so from way back, with condemnations of enslavement by the Barbary pirates being a big focus of English thought on the subject. But those were white, Christian Englishmen being enslaved. Here they fear the same. Those objections had not translated over into complaints against enslaving black people. At this time, they begin to do so. Protests for freedom and independence, which partake of a language of notionally universal rights, indict slavery in a a new way and somewhat link up with the previous religious objections. This is by no means a one-for-one translation; Quaker pacifists are increasingly antislavery but also generally not all-in on the Revolution.  Still, the contradiction troubles whites enough that when combined with previous qualms about slavery a kind of momentum develops to do something. This leads to the first American emancipation: Pennsylvania's gradual emancipation act of 1780. (Efforts to terminate slave importation precede this and are aimed at ending slavery, but don't attack it directly in the same way.) It frees no one immediately, but rather frees those born after its passage once they age out...at twenty-eight. They're indentured servants until that point, which no one is going to reach until 1804. There are repeated moves afterwards to enact immediate emancipation and also free the slaves born too soon to fall under the law. PA would show slaves on its census returns up through 1840. The story is broadly similar in most of the North and this trend never reached farther south than Virginia. There it just barely got its foot in the door and only briefly.  What changes in the nineteenth century US isn't entirely intuitive. It seems that most Northern white opinion believed that something was being done or had been done about slavery and it was on its way out. That's true for them all at home, effective with New Jersey's 1804 gradual emancipation law. Slavery is in steep decline and seems to be fixing itself. A degree of complacency sets in, combined with an expectation that the South would follow along.   The South did not. Before 1863, Southerners probably came closest to emancipation in the 1780s and 1790s and that wasn't very close or very many of them. Instead they became more and more invested in slavery and dedicated to continuing and expanding it forever. Religious and political sentiments don't do it for them and instead they work on systematizing a thoroughgoing proslavery ideology. This includes pretending that slavery is benevolent to the slaves as well as defending it as a morally superior social and labor system to paying wages.   These developments don't go unnoticed in the North. By the 1810s, they've noticed that there hasn't been any action on the South's part. Instead the opening up of the inland South to cotton cultivation has given slavery a huge boost in an environment where it hadn't been doing too badly in the first place. To the Northerners watching, this seems like a breech of trust. They agreed, informally, back during the Revoution that they would quiet down complaints against enslaving blacks with an understanding that the white South was going to see to it. Or that's what they thought they agreed to, anyway. That the South hasn't held up its end of the bargain, but keeps getting all the extra power the Constitution granted to it, is not a-ok with them.  This all erupts into the Missouri Crisis in 1819. Missouri wants to be a state and has slavery. A New York congressman, James Tallmadge, sees that MO has about as many slaves proportionately as New York did when it enacted gradual abolition in 1799. Why not help Missouri get rid of slavery and bring a little balance to the Union? The South responds with outrage that threatens to split the nation's only national political party. It's also an issue where the nation's remaining, much-diminished other party, the Federalists, has a bit of an edge over the Republicans (Jefferson's, not Lincoln's) in the parts of the North where they're still popular. The effort to end slavery in Missouri fails and with it, powerfully discredits the idea of working within the system to end slavery.  Antislavery forces are in disarray afterwards and the bisectional political coalitions that form and re-form out of the wreckage largely close them out of meaningful influence. There are still antislavery people in both parties -somewhat more the Whigs as they emerge- but the constructed landscape of US politics makes major gains against slavery virtually impossible. This takes us to about 1830, at which point the movement for immediate, uncompensated emancipation comes to the fore as an antislavery vehicle. This movement is avowedly anti-political, because they saw how working in the system worked out for them.  Between about the Revolution and the emergence of immediateist abolitionism, there are a few major social changes in the North to go with the changing political environment. The first is the rise of political democracy for white men as the accepted norm. This dates back to about the Revolution and puts severe strains on the old, elite-oriented view of politicians as wise elder sort of figures who are singularly endowed with civic virtue. Now those capacities are more vested in the white male populace as a whole, who reject the hierarchical attitudes embodied in calling one's employer \"master\" and accepting work titles like \"servant.\" Instead \"bosses\" have \"help\". As restrictions on suffrage drop or become nominal for whites (while remaining or increasing for black men) slavery comes to look increasingly antithetical. Wage labor becomes a good in this environment, virtuous in its own right and slavery so acquires a new level of infamy in white minds. This is also, it should be said, accompanied by a marked increase in white supremacy among the same set. As they're losing some autonomy by now laboring more for wages and for other men, these same people assert that they are equals because they are white in new ways. To have a master or be a servant becomes a specific capacity of black people, which they want nothing to do with. This is a change that works both ways, proslavery and antislavery but both markedly antiblack.  The second change is a bit harder to date because there are more successive waves of it, but we must also acknowledge the rise of an evangelical form of Christianity. At the time, this is mostly a reforming religiosity that seeks to improve and perfect human mores and society. Antislavery is a big focus, along with opposing Indian Removal, boosting for temperance, and a passel of related reform causes. Antislavery politics were't invented in that reform foment, but they were re-invented. Much of the excitement here happens in the Burned-Over District of upstate New York, which got its name from the successive waves of revivalism and the new denominations and social movements it spawned. Besides the social reform causes already mentioned, the Mormons, the Adventist family of denominations, and various utopian communities all arise from this era.  The abolitionist fruit of that moment soon re-engage, warily, with politics through third parties and keep the flame alive until the silent consensus of the two national parties to protect slavery cracks up over Texas Annexation and the resulting Mexican War. Then mainstream antislavery politics becomes possible again and the movement largely funnels its energies into that channel. This happens first through the Liberty Party, then the Free Soilers and Conscience Whigs, and finally through the Republican party."

The puritans felt that sex was an important part of married life, and not just for procreation.  Leland Ryken in *Worldly Saints: The Puritans As They Really Were* writes: \"when a New England wife complained, first to her pastor, and then to the whole congregation, that her husband was neglecting their sex life, the church proceeded to excommunicate the man.\"  William Gouge, a puritan preacher, said that married couples should engage in sex \"with good will and delight, willingly, readily, and cheerfully.\"  Further, the large number of puritans who had their first child less than nine months after getting married shows that the puritans were definitely having sex *outside* of marriage too.  As for the stereotype itself, the modern (mis)understanding of the puritans comes largely from Nathaniel Hawthorne's *The Scarlet Letter*, in which puritans are depicted as opposed to all happiness and leisure. This idea took hold and wasn't really questioned academically for the next hundred or so years.  H.L. Mencken - who famously quipped that Puritanism was \"the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy\" - also deserves some of the blame as he pointed to the puritans as those responsible for the \"Victorian America\" that he so derided. He used \"puritan\" as a pejorative to describe those he didn't agree with, and it largely stuck.  Further, /u/plusroyaliste has an excellent post about the Puritans generally, and this thread more closely deals with your question specifically."

The Air Force, being a very new element to warfare, was considered to be very gentlemanly, and as a POW, especially one of high rank, he would be normally be accorded many luxuries and privileges. Even in the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of POW is also very detailed about the treatment of POWs, and does accord more rights and privileges to POWs of higher rank, with the most being accorded to Generals, as Goering was. The Allies saw Goering as a criminal, but he no doubt saw himself as simply another military member, and entitled to the full rights of the convention, and not to be treated as a criminal.  Even during WWII, the Luftwaffe handled Allied POWs from the Air Force, who were generally treated better than their Army or Navy counterparts, when under the supervision of the Luftwaffe.   As far as Goering himself, if you read his confessions and testimony at Nuremberg, he's pretty unabashedly unapologetic for his actions. As a General in a time of war, he would expect to be treated as a POW of high rank, not as a murderer on trial.   You also have to look at the Nuremberg trials in the context of the time. The crimes they were being accused of were LITERALLY the very first time anyone were put on trial for Crimes Against Humanity, and the trial of this kind and scope were completely without precedent. For someone who obviously feels their actions were justified in the context of a war, and feels they are no worse than the enemies they faced in the battlefield, how must they have felt to be told that their actions are so heinous, so terrible, that entirely new laws must be written just to put them on trial for them?   We have the luxury of hindsight in this, but when the information of the Holocaust was being released, no one knew what to do. Eisenhower ordered as much footage to be taken as possibly, because he knew no one would believe the size and scope of it. Given the number of holocaust deniers today, it seems a sensible idea. But at the time, it was unfathomable and people couldn't believe that something so horrific could have happened. It wasn't even imaginable. Even Germans living within proximity of a concentration camp didn't always know what was happening, or certainly the full extent of it.   Then you take the attitude towards Jews in general. Not even in Germany, but everywhere in the world. Germany tried to deport millions of Jews prior to the war, but most countries refused, or only took a small number. In Canada, the Immigration minister at the time was infamously quoted as saying \"None is too many\" with regards to allowing Jewish refugees into Canada. In the US there were similar attitudes of anti-semitism, and a dislike of Jewish immigration. While the Allies didn't know the full extent of the Holocaust, they did know some of it, and bear some responsibility for failing to act earlier and more decisively to get Jews out of Europe. Goering would have known all this, and known the very publicly-expressed anti-Semitic sentiments of the Allies, and their actions against Jewish immigration, so it would seem somewhat hypocritical to be put on trial by people who are somewhat complicit (if only by inaction or neglect) in the crimes they're accusing you of."

                "content": " Hi, currently writing a master\u2019s thesis on comparative ancient Greek and Near Eastern religion (broadly speaking). You are correct in your suspicion that the ancient Greek religion consisted of many local cults with slightly different focuses, but they *did* all recognize a shared pantheon. So everyone in ancient Greece who followed the \u201cGreek religion\u201d would know the broad strokes of the shared mythology: that Hera and Zeus were queen and king of the pantheon, that Ares was their son, that Achilles killed Hector, etc.   However, different areas were more interested in specific deities and had their own local cult traditions. For example, Artemis had a very famous cult at Brauron (~24 miles from Athens), where she was worshipped with rituals and traditions specific to that cult site. Or to take an example that I am studying currently, Hera was recognized as queen of the gods, Zeus\u2019s wife, all throughout Greece, but her importance varied from place to place. We tend to see her as the \u201cgoddess of marriage\u201d, which is partly a construction by post-Renaissance scholars. Hera presided over marriage (and its associated experiences: pregnancy, childbirth, domestic labor), but various regions had their favored female goddesses for that same sphere while still recognizing Hera\u2019s primacy as queen. So Hera was a powerful goddess, and worshipped in her own right, in the Argolid, Boeotia, Arcadia, and Samos (among other places), but in Attica (where Athens is located), she was reduced to \u201cjust\u201d a marriage goddess, and her worship appears to have been restricted to a single, relatively minor festival. (Edit to clarify: I am speaking specifically about the late Archaic period and Classical period in Greece, from the 6th century BCE to 323 BCE, the death of Alexander the Great.)  The ancient authors are partly responsible for the perception that there was a single unified Greek religion. Much of what we know about ancient Greek religion is handed down to us from authors/texts like Hesiod or the Homeric Hymns, which condense multifaceted myths and divinities into streamlined narratives\u2014the way that the Brothers Grimm took European fairytales and codified them into what we now know today. The myths we know from ancient Greece do reflect the broad understanding of the pantheon and mythology, but obscure significant local variation in practice.   Were there populations of ancient Greece that didn\u2019t know about the Titans, or some other less central aspect of Greek mythology? I\u2019ll admit I don\u2019t know much about the Titans myself\u2014amazing how much one can specialize themself into a box\u2014but I can say this: there were plenty of rural, or just uneducated and illiterate people in ancient Greece whose experiences, beliefs, and stories go unrecorded. They may have been aware of and participated in major festivals, dedicated votives at temples, partaken in sacrifices, and told stories about their local heroes, without necessarily knowing the intricate ins-and-outs of what we modern people have been taught is Greek Mythology.   * Clark, I. 1998. \u201cThe Gamos of Hera: Myth and Ritual.\u201d In The Sacred and the Feminine in Ancient Greece, edited by Sue Blundell and Margaret Williamson.

Moreover theoretical concepts like criticality, supercriticality and nuclear chain reactions all appeared in publically published papers prior to the outbreak of war. Further, by the late 30s several different institutes were working on creating a self sustaining nuclear fission reaction.   Had it not been for the outbreak of war it is likely that a civilian scientific reactor would have popped up in the 40s. However outbreak of war meant that research very quickly went very secret, as at least the majority of scientists working in the field were aware of the potentially catastrophic power of the atom. The most famous demonstration of this is the Einstien-Szilard letter to Roosevelt that warned of the potential power of an \"atomic weapon\".   Thus every major power had at the very least a cadre of academics who understood that it should be possible to create a supercriticalty reaction that would unleash a truly terrifying amount of energy. In the US we were so certain that the cannon type uranium fueled bomb would work that we didn't even test it (there was also the issue of each cannon type requiring several months national production of u-235, more on that later). The implosion type Plutonium bomb was tested at Trinity, but that was more a question of if the conventional explosive shell could be detonated precisely enough to induce supercriticality in the Pu core.  The manhattan project was never strictly a question of determining if a nuclear explosion was possible (everyone was pretty certain it was), it was a question of a)if you could build a device to deliver that reaction precisely where and when you want it, the bomb (though obviously precision is a relative term when what you are delivering is an 8 kiloton explosion) and b)producing enough sufficiently pure uranium or plutonium to produce your supercriticality. Fuel production actually took up the majority of the Manhattan  Project's budget and efforts   When the first fireball bloomed over Japan the reactions from the major powers was thus not \"what was that?\" But rather \"dear god the Americans actually cracked it\". Everyone knew it was theoretically possible, but not how close it was.   Perhaps more directly pertinent to your question, the concept of an \"atomic weapon\" actually appears in the public conciousness as early as 1914, in H.G. Wells \"The World Set Free\" a book about a world war ended with atomic weapons that operated by accelerating radioactive decay in a substance, expelling vast amounts of energy in a brief period of radioactive fire, with the side effect of contaminating the land it was used on for many years. While obviously Wells work was innacurate in the method, it was prophetic in depicting the effects of nuclear weapons, and implanted the idea of the atomic bomb into the public conciousness. Leo Szilard, father of fission, was even known to have read the book. I myself wonder if nightmares of Wells atomic fire danced through his head the night he first saw those blips of neutrons dancing on the oscilloscope.  Edit:the US also built a working uranium reactor in 42, so they were 100% certain that criticality was possible before they ever built a bomb."

                "content": " I don't think a real attempt has been made to answer your original question with anything concrete, so I'll have a go! I'm going to use your original example of Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley because that might be instructive.  To start geographically, let's take a look at the regions that lie between Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley. A great deal of that inbetween-land is the Greater Iranian Plateau. This is the point through which contact or trade between these polities/cultures/groups of cultures would most likely have to pass in this era.  There are a number of mysteries regarding the ancient Iranian plateau. Those parts of it that were closest to Mesopotamia are decently known because they were referred to in their texts or because they had their own literature. In the case of Elam, we have both. Elam's position in the ancient Persian Gulf is a little tricky to explain now, as much of the Gulf would have been still underwater or marshlands at that time. But essentially, this region was centered around the modern Iranian province of Ilam all the way down to Fars.  **Elam**  Elam is therefore our first stop between Bronze Age Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley. Elam adopted the cuneiform script that Sumerian culture had developed for their own script, in much the same way that the Akkadians adopted cuneiform for their own needs later on. It was actually not the only script that the Elamites used! A script either developed within Elam itself or from further east is called Linear Elamite, as opposed to Elamite Cuneiform which I have just mentioned. The third is *another*, older riff on cuneiform. The difference between this script, known as Proto-Elamite, and the later Elamite Cuneiform is that the first one is much more pictographic and still not fully understood. Both references in Sumerian texts and Elam's own early inscriptions indicate that it was unified under a single kingship/dynasty on several occasions, even at this early point in its history. It's worth pointing out that even by 2000 BC, the important Elamite city of Susa was already almost two millenia old. We are dealing with a major culture with long roots and capable of competing with Mesopotamia. However, you can see that there seems to be evidence of exchange between the cultures, and we also know that they traded with one another.  The relationship between Elam and Mesopotamia was long and full of twists and turns. If the period I'm dealing with is somewhere around 2500-2000 BC, then bear in mind that Elam was still a competitor with the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 800s BC.  **Problems**  We now reach a problem as we move into the rest of the Iranian plateau. Whilst Elam's own inscriptions have survived the test of time and we also have multiple Mesopotamian states giving their point of view, we cannot say the same for the rest of the plateau. It's not until the Achaemenid Empire (in the 6th century BC!) that we actually start getting a wide picture of what's going on in that part of the world. We have that most universal of problems that occurs when writing has not survived for a particular culture; we don't have much to go on!   However, not all is lost; archaeological knowledge of this era has been growing. And thanks to what we currently know, I can move on to the next section.  **Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex**  The region of the Iranian plateau that this refers to is one that is not considered part of modern Iran, this is why I initially started with the term 'Greater Iranian Plateau'. Bactria and Margiana are individual regions with their own history, but in the context of this period they're referred to in this way for reasons I will shortly explain. In addition, the region in particular that's been reconstructed as being the BMAC homestead is one that roughly straddles the Turkmenistan province of Mary with the Afghanistan provinces of Balkh and Jawzjan, give or take.  Now to talk about this slightly unwieldy title. It's a relatively formal title that's been given to a particular culture that existed at this point. It essentially means that the culture that lived in this area seems to have been using very similar material goods to one another, along with lots of other shared practises that indicate relative certainty in grouping them together. Bactria-Margiana is simply because of where it was located. However, this culture is also known as the 'Oxus Civilization'. The reason for *that* is because it was centered around a particular segment of the river known to the ancient Greeks as the Oxus, and known today as the Amu Darya. If we go back to the geography I mentioned earlier, you can see that this river originates quite far into Central Asia and flows all the way into the Aral sea. It's quite a big river. In fact, in ancient times it would have flowed all the way into the Caspian Sea.  Let me leap to the end a little bit; the BMAC, or Oxus Civilization, seems to have been quite developed. They utilised canals to take the nutrient rich Oxus and use it to fertilise the land around it, and did so from a relatively early point (around the late 2000s BC). It is likely that if this was transmitted, it was from Mesopotamia due to the relative longevity of the practice there and also the known timetable of which cultures/regions developed canal-based irrigation. They had developed urban environments, a high population density, and a vibrant material culture.  However, the reason that I'm having to deal in such cautious language is because we don't have any writing or writing system of any kind preserved for this culture! I don't usually subscribe to the idea of the 'civilization', but generally speaking the only thing missing from the traditional cocktail of what is called civilization in the BMAC is writing. It's also very frustrating; we don't know what language these people spoke. It could be an Indo-European language, in the which case they might have been speaking a precursor to Indo-Iranian languages. But it also might not have been! This means that the BMAC has a very awkward relationship with current arguments regarding Proto-Indo-European's homeland as a language. Depending on the verdict, the BMAC might seem to be smack in the middle of all of this. But again, it also could not!  However, the archaeology has been a little kind to us. I've mentioned this elsewhere, but a survey team attached to an archaeological site dating to Greek control of Bactria (so around 320-140 BC) accidentally uncovered a trading settlement in part of the Oxus valley that is quite clearly attached to the Indus Valley civilization. It's not simply a case of traded goods or inspiration, everything about the material culture of the site suggested that this was a trading colony. So whilst we can't read about it, we know for certain that the Indus Valley culture/cultures had an active interest in their relationship to Bactria.  **Conclusions**  These were almost certainly not the only cultures/groups of cultures that lay between Mesopotamia and the Indus in this stage of the Bronze Age. Archaeological remains have been found in locations outside of these areas, but they are still so poorly understood that I have not yet encountered a publication that can tell me anything other than a catalogue of the items found and vague attempts to sort their relationship to one another. We definitely know that there were multiple states and cultures between India and Mesopotamia in later periods, but we are talking centuries (and in some cases millenia!) later. Bear in mind that the BMAC was as ancient to the Classical Greeks as the Classical Greeks are to us; a lot of things must have happened in the Iranian Plateau during that time, but we're only really aware of its wider context to any certainty starting in the 7th-6th centuries BC, 1300+ years after the Indus Valley Civilization, BMAC, and Mesopotamia all co-existed.  But what we can conclude is that there were trade routes that spanned this length. Proto-Elamite goods have been found in Bactria during this period, Bactrian goods in Elam, Elam and Mesopotamia all over the place, and some Indus Valley seals as far west as Elam. Despite the distances involved, there were relationships between these cultures. Indeed, Bactria's probably got a lot more to say regarding this than we are currently aware- in later periods, the river Oxus was used to ship goods from all over Central Asia into Europe via the Caspian sea, and camel caravans were a major source of income (though the gold deposits, massive agricultural wealth and jewels didn't hurt either!). Indeed, one thing to consider is that any piece of lapis lazuli found before a certain date in Europe, Africa, and West Asia, *must* have come from Bactria; there were no other known sources at that time.  From what we know of the settlement patterns, in this era (late 3rd millenium BC) most major concentrations of development and population focused on easily exploitable agricultural land. The river Oxus/Amu Darya can generate a lot of agriculture when used to irrigate the surrounding area, and the Western Iranian plateau has a number of areas in which intense cultivation is possible without the use of irrigation. Both Elam and Bactria-Margiana seem to have had a dense, settled population, and both were productive agricultural regions. Until we know more about this period, I think a relatively accurate principle is to assume major centres gravitated towards exploitable agriculture."

The \"star\" of the documentary is Graham Hancock who has been writing about an 'alternative' history of human civilization since the 90s. Most notably, his book \"Fingerprints of the Gods\" put forward the hypothesis that there was a civilization on earth that predated our own recorded history by about 10,000 years. The primary source of evidence for the time-frame came from a theory put forward by another author Robert Bauval in a book called the \"Orion Mystery\" that posited the pyramids of Giza were built to mimic the position of the stars in Orion's belt.  There is a complicated argument involving Ancient Egyptian religion, the shafts in the Great Pyramid and the precession of the stars over millennia that leads to the conclusion that the design of the Egyptian monuments were intended to mark a specific period of time, approximately 13,000 years ago.  Taken at face value, it makes for a compelling story, but even Bauval himself admitted in a later book, that he had to fudge some things to make it all work out (while still clinging to the theory).  Hancock's book has a laundry list of other pieces of 'evidence' that amount to unrelated 'mysteries' or oddities from around the world often drawn from other works. Notably, those other works are exclusively popular publications not scientific ones.  Hancock eventually settles on the 'Atlantis' myth as being the pre-existing civilization; however, while the common understanding of Atlantis is an island that was in the Mediterranean, he draws his theory of Atlantis from a theory put forward by Rand and Rose Flem-ath in a 1995 book called \"When the Sky Fell: In Search of Atlantis\".  The Flem-ath's believed that the historical Atlantis was not an island in the Mediterranean but rather the continent of Antarctica, in part based on the work of Charles Hapgood, a keen Atlantis researcher. There was evidence at the time from core-samples that Antarctica used to have a temperate climate (which has been since well established: cf. this article for example) and that supported Charles Hapgood's Theory of Earth Crust Displacement published in his 1958 book \"The Earth's Shifting Crust\" (which included a supporting forward by Albert Einstein) and which he and the Flem-Ath's accounted for Antarctica/Atlantis's shift to the pole as well as the myth of its disappearance.  The time period in which Hapgood believed Antarctica still had a temperate climate roughly coincides with the time frame that Bauval and Hancock pinned the the existence of their antediluvian civilization; that however, has been disproven (for example: Ingolfsson, O. (2004) Quaternary glacial and climate history of Antarctica.)  All of these authors, Hapgood, the Flem-Aths, Bauval and Hancock have assembled a compelling story that certainly captures the imagination\u2014allusions to their theories show up in popular culture, for example in the 'Stargate' franchise. And although, superficially it appears that they have scientific evidence to support their claims much of that evidence doesn't hold up to scrutiny or more often, is only used to insinuate a conclusion rather than support it. Their work certainly does not constitute anything like scientific rigor and it shouldn't be considered anything more generous than a fun thought experiment. You do not need to dig very deeply before you find their connections to and inspiration from the likes of occult writer Colin Wilson and out-right fraudster Erich von D\u00e4niken who have made outlandish claims concerning ancient civilizations.  Hancock, in particular, as one of the most well-known of proponents of this grand theory of the existence of a prehistorical civilization, has a very poor reputation amongst scientists and historians. He's also notable for his laughable (and disproven) claims about the 'face on Mars' and its supposed connection to the Sphinx."

I am about to complete my 3 month probationary period in the next couple weeks.   Last week, the VP of our company who is also director of HR from headquarters came to our office and talked with each of us employees individually.   When it was my turn, the VP talked with me for 3 hours! About 10 minutes was about how I was liking the company so far. Then, the remaining 2 hours and 50 minutes is what I'm a little confused about.   The VP basically gave me his whole life story, showed me pictures of the new mansion and Mercedes G wagon he bought \"with cash\" and told me his dream was for me to be able to do the same. Then he went on to tell me that even though I'm not making much money working at the company now, he hopes that I can prove my value to the company and that the more money I can bring in, the more successful I will be there.   Then he said that our company has been struggling with high turnover recently. He told me that even if one of our competing companies offers me twice my current salary for the same position, I shouldn't take it because they aren't as good as us.   Then finally, he gave me half an hour of dating/marriage advice...  Is this weird? Any insight greatly appreciated!\n\nAssistant:"

I had a weird conversation with my boss today. I have never gotten an official title change, but I represent my company in some capacities after a few years here. I often drive within the city and represent us. I am a graphic designer.  Today boss called me into his office first thing, 8 am. Said \"Good morning N. I received a complaint about your vehicle and it made me realize that I agree it is inappropriate for someone representing our company. I know it's a little difficult to get cars right now but I need you to make the effort. I need you to have a new car by the end of the month. We pay you enough. You can have Friday as a paid day off to go shopping.\"  I feel this is very inappropriate.  My vehicle is a 1983 Honda Accord hatchback. Pristine paint job and interior. Absolutely nothing wrong with this car -- I have put more into making it look nice than I initially paid for it. It's not tacky or flashy in any way -- just a clean white car with tan leather interior. I think it's a cool car. I deliberately chose it because I think it's a cool car. I am a graphic designer and appreciate aesthetics. I have no need for or desire to own a second car.  I asked my boss if a company car was an option and he said \"You buy clothes that are appropriate for work. Your car is the same thing.\"  Thoughts? How common/appropriate is this? It feels insane to be told I need a new car to keep a job, but I do enjoy my job and have had a good relation with my boss so far. I am trying to figure out how to neutralize the situation and resume status quo if at all possible.\n\nAssistant:"

But he KNEW he was the dullest blade in the drawer, so he was 100% committed to absorbing training exactly as presented.  He did exactly what he was told, learned all the scripts, and basically was a superstar sales guy from day 1.

If you haven't seen my last post, you can check it out here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/lma8iu/il\\_possible\\_pregnancy\\_discrimination/  To sum it up: My wife told her job she was pregnant while also trying to move to a different shift. They wanted her to take a physical requiring her to lift 70lbs (in the instance of an emergency) although their policy states they only have to lift 35lbs. Her doctor wouldn't sign off due to pregnancy, so her manager removed her from the schedule and stated my wife would need to file for short-term disability, but if that wasn't approved would be required to use her PTO for the time off for the time she needs off for the pregnancy.  **Update since my last post:**  We decided to speak with my wife's aunt. Her aunt is an HR rep at her job and was unaware of my wife's pregnancy so it kind of sucked we had to deliver the news under these circumstances, but it is what it is. She let us know that if they can't find accommodation that they must find her another position.  My wife's hr rep left her a message stating they could possibly find her an alternate part-time position. We informed her aunt of what they stated and she told my wife not to accept because they must give her a position of equal value (full-time at same pay).  My wife met with her hr rep and they initially were not offering anything other than the pt position. My wife then said she really didn't want to, but would be forced to file an EEOC(equal employment opportunity commission) claim if they could not provide any more help.  Today, my wife's hr rep called informing her they have possibly found a position for her with the same amount of hours and pay! \\*shocker\\*  We are still waiting to hear back if it's a \"for sure\" on that position - the hiring recruiters are checking to see if my wife fits the requirements for that open position.\n\nAssistant:"

If there was an emergency and someone was falling or about to fall, there wouldn\u2019t necessarily be time for someone else to come assist before an injury to either the patient or the employee occurred. A reasonable accommodation would be providing a device or something to enable the employee to do their job. Like a chair to someone whose job would normally be to stand behind a desk all day. Requiring another employee to do parts of your wife\u2019s job for her isn\u2019t considered a reasonable accommodation. She would still need to be able to perform the duties of her job herself.

It\u2019s a combination of employers   A) hiring people or using managers with no experience recruiting. Everyone thinks it\u2019s so easy, but most recruiters don\u2019t make the cut. Many of the inexperienced recruiters can\u2019t handle the candidate reaction to a rejection so they just don\u2019t do it. Hiring managers think they are too good for admin work (and hey they are probably really busy) so once they hire someone they immediately change their focus to the next hire/fire/etc.   B) refusing to pay a little bit more money for intuitive software that at the very least automatically says \u201chey we got your info, don\u2019t call us well call you if interested.\u201d Otherwise someone actually has to go in and click things to make that happen.  C) expecting too much from recruiters. I\u2019ve worked weekends just to send mass templates rejection letters because I have too much other stuff to do during work time. It can take 5 mins per candidate to review and reject them which seems easy enough...  but if you are over worked as it is and you have 800 applicants ...it\u2019s a wild Saturday night reflecting people who don\u2019t meet even the minimum requirements but applied anyway.   It\u2019s also our culture of reality tv and swiping left. There are no consequences for not doing things the right way. A bad Glassdoor review? That really does nothing to someone who will move on to the next job in a few months.   Recruiters are also scared of making a mistake and saying something that will get them in trouble. Most won\u2019t give any feedback at all if the candidate is not a white male for fear of discrimination charges.   The crazy thing is when I call people to reject them (only if they have had a phone/in person interview) I am often hit with their wrath and loathing of the whole thing. I\u2019ve had people tell me off for 5+ minutes because OTHER recruiters don\u2019t call back about other jobs while I\u2019m rejecting them from my job.

I\u2019m a woman in a very heavily male-dominated industry. I work in a highly collaborative and creative field. So whoever is on my team, I\u2019m literally talking to them and brainstorming and creating with them all day long. I\u2019m also pretty fresh in my industry. My current job was pretty much a pipe dream until it happened to me.  I\u2019ve performed excellently so far and have made a really great name for myself in my company. I\u2019m a contractor though and I was hoping to get a full-time offer. Now I\u2019m not so sure. Part of my success was due to my manager, let\u2019s call him Ben. He is absolutely brilliant. He has been my biggest supporter since day 1 and done everything possible to set me up for success and publicly announce my achievements. We also became close friends and talked about our personal lives sometimes.  Everything going great right? Not so much. At first, Ben and I clicked really well. We have very similar wit and sense of humor. He\u2019s a huge jokester and friends with everyone at the company. He can do no wrong in their eyes. In the beginning, I actually kind of liked him too.  In some sense I always knew he loved me. But a few months in, it got so intense he couldn\u2019t handle it anymore and started acting weirdly before he told me he liked me. I was kinda on the spot and didn\u2019t say anything except \u201cokaaaay\u201d. That night he started texting me, and I was drinking (rare for me) and very drunk later on. We ended up flirting heavily for a few hours.  To me, it was fun to flirt with him and I maybe-liked him but I also clearly stated I wouldn\u2019t date a coworker and due to some personal things wasn\u2019t interested in dating at all for the foreseeable future. Apparently he didn\u2019t get the message.  Almost immediately, it became incredibly clear that he did not have a crush on me, he was OBSESSED with me. Like he\u2019s pictured our marriage and kids. Right away he started making incredibly strange comments. I\u2019ll give some examples:  Me: Oh this guy I was seeing said X I\u2019m so annoyed  Him: What? Why would you care? All you need to be worrying about is me.  Me: (says nothing, looks at my phone at work)  Him: \\*peers over my shoulder at my phone\\* WTF you\u2019re still on bumble? I thought you deleted those apps!  (Note: this is completely a fantasy of his, we flirted for one day. I NEVER implied any sort of commitment and explicitly said that would never happen).  Me: Coworker said something weird (insert what coworker said)  Him: Oh yeah he likes you so he\u2019s just confirming that we\u2019re in a relationship  Me: What relationship?  Him: Oh Alice, me and you are no secret at work  (WHAT FUCKING RELATIONSHIP!?!?!!!!! WE HAD ONE TEXT CONVERSATION)  So at the point the above conversations happened, along with other stuff he said, I realized that he did not see us as friends who were innocently flirty sometimes. He sees me as his future wife and has said as much. At this point I 100% dropped all flirting. I realized that I had made a MASSIVE mistake. I had actually liked him at first, but his obsession and presumptions just killed any attraction.  I also told him this directly in a text, not the reason why because I need him on my side at work, but I told him something like \u201cHey just as a reminder, I\u2019m not interested in dating right now and I like being just friends. This isn\u2019t going to change for the foreseeable future.\u201d  And he goes \u201cYeah I know, you already told me. We\u2019re just platonic.\u201d  All good right? Hahahahahaha, wrong again bucko. I\u2019ve been rarely responding to his texts, and deflecting every single thing he says that is flirty.  Now he realizes I\u2019m not interested. This is where Ben starts really embarrassing himself.  &#x200B;  1. He tells me at work that on a trip he took, he met up with my ex-coworker and fucked her.    1.  **My response**: Oh dope she\u2019s beautiful glad you had fun. (They never met up, they did not hookup, he doesn\u2019t know that me and her still talk.) 2. He begins insisting he is not interested me, and is interested in 2 of my coworkers Becky and Susan. He begins interrupting me all day long to talk about how hot Becky and Susan are and how he\u2019s making progress with them.    1. **My response**: That\u2019s awesome. Yeah I love them too. Good for you. (They are not interested in him at all and they have no relationship outside of a professional one. I suspect they are merely tolerating him as well.) 3. He starts to make a point to outline, ON A DAILY BASIS, the reasons me and him would never work out. (Um, I\u2019m not an option, that\u2019s why. But whatever helps you sleep at like.) This stuff comes out of nowhere. He literally texts me \u201cHey are you going to X this weekend?\u201d Me: Nah, I\u2019m staying in. Him: \u201cYou know, we would never work out cause you\u2019re just too wild for me. You\u2019d get bored so easily. You\u2019d probably be so annoyed about XYZ, and I don\u2019t want to leave the state but you do so it just would never work.\u201d Me: What? 4. \\*He found out through the grapevine I actually have a crush on a coworker who is my equal at work\\* He texts me something like \u201cOh so you like Matt?\u201d 5. **Me** (hoping it would help him move on): Kinda, he\u2019s cute. **Him**: \u201cAhahaha we both know if you were going to be with anyone it would be me and as soon as you get a different job or I leave you\u2019ll be running over here screaming Daddy and I\u2019m gunna tear that pussy up.\u201d **Me**: What possessed you to text that? **Him**: \u201cMy wit, charm, and sarcastic nature.\u201d Me: \u201cOk\u201d 6. He has started this OVER THE TOP obsession with my dating life. Which is nonexistent by choice. It has sparked COUNTLESS conversations. He reads my phone over my shoulder every chance he gets. He will pop off \u201cWho\u2019s Derek?\u201d and I used to tell him, my friend, but now I say straight up \u201cnone of your business.\u201d And he\u2019ll go on all day, \u201cOOOOOH SHE\u2019S TEXTING DEREK!!!!\u201d \u201cALICE HAS A BOYFRIEND!\u201d \u201cWhat are you doing this weekend? Going to fuck Derek? Who texted you, I bet it\u2019s Derek!!\u201d \u201cWhat is he 18? What does he do? I bet he\u2019s broke ahahaha you\u2019re fucking yourself over.\u201d These comments are nonstop, all day long, about anybody I interact with. For the record, Derek was dog sitting for me one time. Nobody is immune from this. I\u2019ll go have coffee with a woman and he\u2019s on for DAYS about how I\u2019m a lesbian, how I\u2019m fucking this girl, etc.\u201d Every single day it\u2019s \u201cSo you\u2019re still on bumble? How\u2019s it going? Any promising matches?\u201d 7. More comments about my dating choices that he knows nothing about. Things like \u201coh you support black rights but you date the very thing you claim to hate? White men? You\u2019re such a fucking hypocrite\u201d Me: Ben I don\u2019t hate white men what the fuck are you talking about? Did you know that a woman can actually support black people and also white people? That we are all human? Him: \u201cOK tell yourself that hahaha\u201d 8. The typical obsessive \u201cyou looked amazing today.\u201d \u201cwho were you trying to impress with that outfit\u201d \u201cwhy are you talking to X coworker so much today?\u201d \u201cThe only person in this company you should focus on is me.\u201d  It effects my work severely now. Not only because I sit right next to him and I\u2019m not allowed to sit anywhere else (his rule), so I deal with his interruptions all fucking day long, but because he lets it effect our work. On days that I give him less attention than others, he will not answer my work-related questions. Or he will just counter my work questions with personal questions.  Today, he interrupted me for the millionth time while I was heads downs working. I take my headphones out and he goes \u201cHey btw Becky is way hotter than you and any guy you like would actually go for her.\u201d (I love Becky, he\u2019s a fucking idiot for trying this). And I finally said \u201cBen, you need to focus on you for a minute and a lot less on me.\u201d The whole team heard (but I had no other choice) and he goes \u201cwow okay. I\u2019m not talking to you.\u201d And he didn\u2019t talk to me for the rest of the day even when I required his work-related input.  I could go on forever but I\u2019m exhausted so I\u2019ll leave it at that. I want to say that in between those moments, Ben can be normal and is still supportive of me at work and pushing promotions for me to his higher ups. We are still friendly. I don\u2019t think he can take a fucking social cue and realize how much he is bothering me.  \\*\\*In my state I have NO HR protection as I am a contractor. I legally can not launch an HR complaint as I don\u2019t technically work for the company. I could go to his boss but that\u2019s very risky, I\u2019m brand new and they\u2019ve worked together for many years. He also just got a promotion. I would get fired, I know because this has happened before, I went to my boss\u2019s boss, and I was fired 4 days later.\\*\\*  I\u2019ve begun looking for a new job and I interview this week. I would rather stay because beyond Ben I\u2019ve never worked in a better environment. However, I\u2019m well aware that he is INCAPABLE of separating his feelings from me (which he directly admitted was an obsession). I do not want to work with him any longer even at the same company because Ben is like a fruit fly landing on my nose 18,000 times a day.  I actually truly believe that he does not want to be obsessed with me. He has said literally \u201cFighting my obsession with you is my biggest obstacle at work.\u201d Due to his standing, he could get me a massive raise and promotion and for a while I thought it was worth putting up with him. I no longer feel that way. I would do anything to get away from him, INCLUDING QUITTING WITHOUT ANOTHER JOB LINED UP NOW. But I\u2019m trying to somehow get through this and keep this connection relatively in tact since he\u2019s so relevant in the industry.  Is there any fucking way to salvage this situation? Is there anything I should do? Speak to him directly? Quit? Burn this bridge forever and tell him straight up that he is harassing me and I will tell his boss if he doesn\u2019t stop? This could ruin my reputation in my very close knit industry. I feel absolutely fucked in the worst way.  \\*\\*Is he going to murder me?\\*\\* I feel like his obsession could turn dangerous, although he seems very kind and gentle.  Tldr; my manager is obsessed with me and harasses me all day long. Even when it\u2019s not directly sexual or romantic, he bothers me literally every 30 seconds for no reason. He is constantly begging for my time, attention, and love. I am about to gouge my own eyeballs out.\n\nAssistant:"

Now, the expectation is the candidate is there to interview/make a pitch the the employer - the hirer no longer really comes with questions. Location: New York State, USA  I'm in my 30s, I'm a data and finance guy (I have a MA in Econ), and I work in banking and insurance.  A year and a half ago, I moved to my current home, from a different state. That move set off a string of job interviews. I ended up taking a job that was a \"good enough for now\" thing, worked it for a year, but kept on interviewing. Just a few months ago, I then took a different job at a different company (better pay, better gig).  So for those of you keeping score at home - I've had two flurries of job interviews for professional, salaried jobs at big private companies, in the last 2 years. During both of those \"flurries,\" I interviewed at half a dozen or so places (mostly local companies, but some jobs I interviewed for were work-from-home jobs for national companies).  I noticed something over the course of doing those interviews - I'm not sure if its just normal for people at my career stage, or if its just something that's just the new normal everywhere - but I was curious if other people had had the same experience. It's this:  *Ten years ago, when I was in my 20s, when I interviewed at places, I was GRILLED. They quizzed me, they had me take computer literacy tests, I would be interviewed by at least 5 or 6 people, I would be asked to give a presentation or prepare something, I was asked GOOD questions and we had a conversation...*  *But in all the interviews I had over the last 2 years - NOTHING. I go there, and no one has read my resume, no one knows my background, no one has ANY questions for me. The expectation seems to have shifted from the hirer wants to ask you questions to figure out if your the person they want to hire, to the expectation of an interview being 100% just they're inviting me in to make a pitch for myself. It's entirely a one way thing.*  And yes, back in my 20s, I did make a \"and here's why I think I'd be good\" pitch during interviews. But that was never the ONLY part of the interview process. Now it seems to be.  Is there some secret hidden genius to this way of interviewing? Because for the job candidate, it just seems like you're lazy, disorganized, or don't really know what you want.  First off, its really hard to explain why I'd be good for the job, because I'm just going off of the job description, and that's typically crap. They're written in vague language, and always seem like the hiring manager just cut and pasted random paragraphs from other job desc he saw on Indeed and hour before it was due. (Or worse - they're written by an HR person who has no clue what the hiring manager's department even does). That's why job interviews should be a TWO SIDED conversation. The job post was enough to get me interested, but you and I need to talk and get on the same page about what the gig entails, and then we can BOTH decide if me taking it makes sense.  Second, if you're not coming in prepared, it becomes REALLY easy for people to game the system and just tell you everything you want to hear and get hired.  Third, its just not a great usage of anyone's time. On the rare occasion I am asked a direct and substantive question during the interview, its ALWAYS something I already talked about on my resume. If you read it before I got here, we'd be skipping all this surface level stuff and getting to an actually useful discussion.  So what about it? Did I just have a string of rotten luck, or have other people been noticing the same thing -- interviews where the interviewer seems to be just winging it, and you're expected to lead the show?\n\nAssistant:"

The program forces an option before continuing, and he put decline every time we got to one of those choices. Fast forward to a couple of weeks since his start date, and I get a call from HR saying he must choose male or female, without any explanation as to why and when I said hey 'decline' is an option on there, they still say he must choose. This is a really hard worker, not that it would matter if he wasn't, and I don't want to give him any more anxiety than I'm sure he's already going through.

Okay so when I was 21 I was a high school teacher and I saw lots of 13/14 year old girls wear makeup to try to make themselves look better.

I had conversations with some of the girls, re: body image, acne, skin etc and found the insecurities were beginning much younger.   I decided to not wear any daily makeup from that moment forward. I wanted these girls to see that there are women out there who embrace their natural look and feel confident without makeup.   I possibly wear makeup once per month if it\u2019s an important thing, such as a wedding, or event etc. I do like wearing it because it\u2019s fun to put on and I admire the people (of all genders) who wear it daily.

Hello (and thanks in advance for whatever help you can provide!),  I was offered a temp-to-hire position with a company by way of a staffing agency following an interview with the company. The staffing coordinator reached out to me and told me that it was going to be $15 an hour, etc. and that I just needed to go to LabCorp and complete a pre-employment  FM-590PU POCT Urine drug screen and would then be able to being work.   I immediately told the staffing coordinator in vague terms that I have a medication that will probably render a positive result, and I asked what I needed to do in order to show that it was a lawfully prescribed medication deemed necessary by a medical professional. She told me to bring my prescription bottle to the testing site. I did just that, and when I was called back for the test I was immediately informed that it went against HIPAA stipulations for the testing facility to know anything about the medication I take; they wouldn't even let me back there before I brought the medication back to my car.  I told the staffing coordinator about this and she claimed to think that was odd. She didn't really know what to do...she said she'd let me know when she gets an alert of a pass or fail on her end and I asked if it'd be helpful for me to reach out to LabCorp and she said she didn't know but it was worth a shot. I did just that, and was rudely told by three different people that LabCorp couldn't do anything about that and were not allowed to have any info about my medication or medical history. They said that an MRO would likely reach out in the event of a positive test within a few days.   I was again in touch with the staffing coordinator and relayed this info; she said they didn't have an MRO because it was too expensive and that in the event of a positive result--as per the VP of HR--I would just need a note from my Doctor on his letterhead--addressed to the VP of HR for the staffing firm--explaining that the prescription medication that rendered a positive screening was due to a lawfully prescribed medication deemed necessary by him. The test comes back positive and I went ahead and got my doctor to write the letter and email it to the VP of HR.  The staffing coordinator gets in touch with me, says that's perfect and that the business is waiting a few more days to take on new hires due to COVID-19 which makes sense of course. I get a call about a week later from the staffing coordinator asking if I'm ready to start. I said yes, and she said the business is ready for me to come in and that she'll reach back out for a specific start date.   She reaches back out shortly, but it is to say that while the Doctor's note was enough for the staffing firm itself (which doesn't even require a drug screen--she communicated to me that the drug screening was specifically a stipulation of the business for which I would be working), the business expressed that any positive result is a no-go for them, regardless of legitimate medical reason, etc.  I expressed that this seemed discriminatory, and she told me that she would \"look into it\" and talk to the VP of HR.

They don't want it and they aren't going to write it on your drug testing form as it's none of their business.    What should have happened after your positive result is either:  1. It should have been referred to an MRO who would have reversed your result to a negative upon receipt of a valid Rx or doctor's note.  This would normally be done BEFORE any type of preliminary result is sent to the employer (or staffing agency) so they have NO knowledge of your private medical info. OR 2. The positive result goes to the employer and they ask if you have an Rx or doctor's note that would explain the positive result.  In states where an MRO is not required companies can do #2, but it is still a very bad idea.  Most companies have no earthly idea what might cause a positive result even with that additional information (does your drug brand equate to the drug class listed as positive on the result?, etc.), and most don't WANT to know about your legit Rx use because they know it's none of their business.  An MRO is always preferred.  Honestly, this is bullshit on both the staffing firm's and company's part.  If you have a valid Rx for that drug, then your test is, in effect, a negative result, so the company should consider it as such.  And the staffing company is stupid and reckless for not utilizing an MRO.  They're not THAT expensive."

[MO] MO  Earlier this year, I was approved for intermittent FMLA time off at my previous job. For context, I worked from home for a call center. I got this job during the beginning of Covid, and worked strictly remotely. I had actually only been to the office to pick up my work computer.  Things were going well, and I was able to address a lot of my health issues.  One Friday at work, I had to take off from 4-6 PM for medical issues. Typically, I would call an automated phone system and be able to record the absence reasoning as FMLA, but unfortunately that phone line was down.  I called multiple times with no luck.  Most of the time, I would\u2019ve been able to contact my supervisor, but of course she gets off work at 4.  I had no ability to report the absence.  My next shift was the following Monday, and that morning I get a message from my manager who seemed frantic about my absence.  I told her the situation that I took FMLA time off, the phone lines were down, and I was going to ask her to change it. She messages me that HR was denying her to change my absence to unexcused to excused?  A hour later, I get called into a meeting, and my supervisor told me since I missed those 2 hours that I was terminated immediately.  I didn\u2019t know what to say. I was confused since there hasn\u2019t ever been a problem before.  Later, I had the company conduct an internal investigation for any FMLA violations. They found that my termination did not violate any FMLA laws, and that I was fired for the absence being unexcused. In that same email they attached their attendance policy which they claim I violated.  In the policy, it says \u201cEmployees must notify the reasoning for absences by the end of their next scheduled work day\u201d.  I asked for it to be changed to FMLA, but simply was denied the ability. If the phone line had been up and running, I would have never been terminated!  I didn\u2019t have any performance issues or anything.  I\u2019ve learned a lot about FMLA law after losing my job, and this doesn\u2019t seem right to me.  Their attendance policy wasn\u2019t ever violated, and it was my responsibility to follow under the fmla.  Is this considered interference?\n\nAssistant:"

I work for a healthcare organization in a role which, pre covid, was remote with the exception of meeting with clinicians to go over report findings - this was 1 to 2 times per week. When covid hit, the department transitioned to fully remote. During this time, we hired on two additional resources, one in state and one out of state, which is not driving distance. Both were told the position is remote. This week leadership has informed us that those in state employees will be expected to return to in person meetings if the clinician requests, however the our of state employee can not participate and will be exempt. All in state and out of state employees have the same job title. Is it acceptable to have this requirement for in person meetings when not all are able to accommodate the requests?

I think, though, you should look beyond this event and see the long term direction.  Your organization is likely moving towards bringing everyone back into the office.

I work in a fairly high stress field, my boss's new boss is extremely demanding with poor personal skills and knowledge of my position, and they've insisted on us being back at the office despite this job easily being done remotely.  For all those reasons I've decided to move on. My wife is a healthcare professional and we're fortunate we can keep our lifestyle on only her income. So after talking it over with her I decided to give my notice.  I typed up a dated letter saying essentially \"I regret to inform you I am resigning my position and Nov 24 will be my last day at the company etc.\" I signed it and walked into my boss's office, asked if we could talk, told him I was going to be moving on and gave him the letter.  He goes \"Wow, this is a shock.\" And asked where I was going.  I said I didn't have a job lined up, the job had been really stressful lately and I was looking forward to spending some time at home and spending time with my son (I have a one year old son), maybe doing the stay-at-home dad thing awhile, and maybe pickup some remote/contract work.  My boss gets extremely agitated telling me I have a family to support now and I can't quit my job without a new job lined up. He proceeds to tell me some story from years ago about how his wife lost her job and his job was the only reason his kids ate during that time.  I said my wife does okay (he knows my wife's profession) and we'd be okay. He said he \"couldn't accept\" my resignation and wanted me to think it over.  I said my mind was pretty much made up. He kept harping about money. Finally I said it directly \"My wife makes a lot of money so we'll be okay.\" And he just keeps saying \"You need to think this through.\"  This was frustrating at this point so I said I would think about it and left. Then he comes out and says back in his day (he's in his 60s) it was pretty rare for women to be the primary breadwinner for a family so that's why he's having such a hard time seeing it. Thanks for attacking my masculinity, I guess?  He also gave me back my resignation letter and told me to hold on to it while I think about it.  Should I just give it to HR so it's official?

But, this group has been going out of their way every day to create trouble and run to the president of the company, blowing this way our of proportion.  Going back a bit now.  I've always been nice to them, trying to help in any way possible.  They have not been the same to me.  They have tried to kick me out and restrict my duties in any way imaginable.  There was an incident in the summer (don't want to go into specifics) but the leader of their group actually tried to get me fired over it (failed obviously).  I want to make it clear that they are not my bosses.  We've all been directed to work together, but again I do not work FOR them, but rather WITH them.  Another incident happened today and another member of their group made multiple statements about how they are my bosses and I need to \"jump off a bridge\" for them.  Well obviously I don't/won't.  He also said that I should be fired for insubordination in a conversation to my boss today.  They talk down to me, and on multiple occassions gang up 3v1 on me to \"put me in my place\".  Almost every day for the past two weeks I come home angry/upset.  I can deal with their nonsense but the fact that it does affect me after work does raise an eyebrow.  My boss mentioned going to HR as a tactic to use against them in our advantage for gaining more power.  I think I do have an actual claim of harassment from them (with almost all of our conversations being over an instant messenger so all recorded).  I'm considering going this route now.    I came here for guidance on whether I should actually do it.  I think there is enough to justify harassment.  I do not appreciate the way any of them talk to me (always talking down and very negative).  I have multiple examples of this.  Nothing specific like name calling, sexual harrassment, etc. but the way they simply talk to me.  Is this viable?\n\nAssistant:"

My managers all came out saying that I did great and that I could use them for a reference any time.  The problem, though, is getting my foot in the door.

Now if we look at plants, or vegetative beings in general, how can we say they don't experience similar things? It seems of course kind of weird to think about it, since we barely see that they care about situations we would see as 'painful' or something. Yet, it could be very much possible, maybe even plausible, that plants experience the world with subjective 'feelings', just not in the same way humans do.   If we look at evolution, both humans and plants seem to strive for their species to stay alive, and IF conciousness is an evolutionary trait, as some people argue, then it's logical to assume that plants could develop one as well.  So would it be reasonable to assume plants have qualia? Or is the lack of evidence enough to completely ignore this question (I wouldn't think so)? And IF plants have qualia, what implications would that bring for ethics? If plants are concious, and I HAVE to kill other concious beings to survive, is veganism then still valid, for example? Should ethics then be expanded to all living creatures, even if only humans can discuss what's good or bad?\n\nAssistant:"

There\u2019s a temptation to grant plants having sentience purely on the basis of plants being living things.  But the terms \u201cconsciousness\u201d, \u201csentience\u201d, even qualia, don\u2019t have a very precise meaning.  Many recent studies and experiments report plants having the ability to communicate with other plants and insects, and having a sensory structure that resembles a nervous system. These two points make it very tempting to grant consciousness to plants when we reflect on how we experience these abilities ourselves. But plants aren\u2019t conscious, if you mean, that they have agency over their actions in the same way we do. Plants can\u2019t intentionally do something unhealthy to itself, or weigh up its options, or consider something in abstract, or imagine. If plants had \u201cexperiences\u201d at all, they would be imprisoned into a relatively simple set of parameters, with perhaps no executive control over how it reacts to its environment. We see this particularly in insects already. When the Sphex wasp brings prey back to its burrow, it puts it down and checks inside the burrow to see if it\u2019s safe to drag the corpse in. If you move the corpse even slightly farther away from the burrow whilst the wasp is inside, it will repeat the whole process of bringing the corpse to the burrow and checking inside, indefinitely. This is called \u201csphexism\u201d after the Sphex wasp, and is probably a phenomena thats present in many low-complexity life forms. Arguably in humans as well.  But I think, as a living thing, there is certainly a \u201cwhat is it like?\u201d to be a plant. Human consciousness is not fully understood, but plenty contest that it\u2019s appearance is an illusion of a vastly more complex version of itself. Considering what this \u201ccomplex version\u201d really is, any living thing would have this underlying complexity governing not only their actions, but the  experience of reality they have that leads them to behave in certain ways.  Ie. A tree grows towards sunlight. It could only do this if it had a sensory experience of reality that logically inclined it to move towards where the light was. There\u2019s \u201csomething it\u2019s like to be a tree\u201d that encourages it to move towards sunlight.  Plants having a \u201cwhat is it like?\u201d, and therefore \u201cexperiences\u201d of pain and pleasure, should impact the perspective of your own ethics, but I argue shouldn\u2019t create brand new obligations. Spinoza took the view that there is a \u201cwhat is it like?\u201d to be any object that\u2019s an aggregate of some basic unit (atoms, or their derivatives, or their derivatives, etc). Yet, his ethical outlook didn\u2019t obligate anyone to avoid stepping on all grass full-stop. He argued that since all of a single blade of grass\u2019 needs are also held by a human, beside many more the grass doesn\u2019t have, the human isn\u2019t immoral for stepping on grass. The human has many more needs and factors affecting its existence than a blade of grass, a human can\u2019t help but harm other living things to flourish (to a certain degree, of course). I mean, if you\u2019re mindlessly pulling grass out in order to \u201churt\u201d plants, that\u2019s a different story. Spinoza\u2019s argument ends up being that if you do not have bad intentions, it\u2019s necessary (given degrees), and you are a more complex life form, it\u2019s not immoral. I should mention, however, that Spinozian ethics is a hairy mess that involves a lot more than the small part of it I\u2019ve mentioned\u2014largely because of his metaphysical commitments that I won\u2019t get into here.   There already are substantive ethical systems that have accounted for the experiences of all living beings, in eastern philosophy. Buddhist metaphysics pretty much parallel Spinoza\u2019s in their attribution of the inherent experiential value of living things. In Buddhism, it is a tenant to not kill any living thing (written in the Kaya Kamma, although interpreting it via terms like moral/immoral is oversimplifying)."

Obviously I\u2019m not trying to convert but to simply help her find the importance of philosophy.  That said I need a good podcast episode that doesn\u2019t just give an overview of what philosophy is or start with Plato or Descartes. That\u2019s too removed from her life for her to find any meaning in it. I don\u2019t have much experience with podcasts as I have mostly stuck to more technical lectures and the literature itself. I\u2019m currently thinking PhilosophizeThis! can be a good intro. While I do understand the limitations of that particular podcast (from the episodes I\u2019ve listened to it seems that there are some inconsistencies, quite a few mischaracterizations, and overgeneralization) but it has one thing the vast majority of podcasts out there don\u2019t have and that is spunk. It sounds real cool so hopefully that will appeal to her.  She\u2019s into psychology and very religious, if that helps. She doesn\u2019t seem interested in any particular area and finds them all pointless. I was personally thinking I might show her PT\u2019s episode on the Frankfurt school that deals with the enlightenment but he makes some kinda weird remarks on how they view the enlightenment. Foucault might be another cool one but I\u2019ve spoken at length about it in person to her and she doesn\u2019t seem that impressed. Any ideas?\n\nAssistant:"

You can see him lecturing on it here.  Paul Mason's book *Postcapitalism: A Guide to Our Future* argues that capitalism, at least its neoliberal version, is fundamentally incompatible with the information economy, and so new economic arrangements will be required.  Kathi Weeks' *The Problem with Work* is one of the major arguments for a post-work society.  Somewhat related to that is Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams' *Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work*.  I guess this is accelerationism, but don't take the internet's word for what Srnicek and Williams are up to.  It argues we need to have four interrelated goals: full automation (as a political goal, rather than a slow and half-assed economic necessity), a UBI, the end of the work ethic, and reduced working hours."

Been working through Existentialists like Kierkegaard  and Camus recently,  and I'd like to tackle Nietzsche, because he has great value as source of criticism and as a foil to to a lot of ideas that feel more natural to me.   When I have engaged seriously with Nietzsche in the past, I've found it very productive, but it's very slow, hard work for me, because I have to spend time and energy getting out of my own way, so to speak.  Finding the motivation to engage with him is difficult in the first place when I could go work on Hegel or Kant or someone I have more in common with and have more fun.  When I do engage with him he always gets me riled and I end up strawmanning him and missing out on what he really has on offer, so I have to go over it and over it to actually get to the good stuff.

This is stupid advice, of course, but what you need to do is create some kind of reflective distance between yourself and a text and make yourself into a different kind of audience member.  This is like what the media critic has to do when they put their critical tools on the backburner and just try to enjoy a piece of fiction without trying to carve it up in their mind while they watch it.  If you want to engage with a text critically (in the way contemporary philosophers mean it) you need to make yourself a little clean room in your mind where you go to just read stuff and figure out how it works.  Approach the text the way an anthropologist approaches a piece of unearthed technology.  What is this thing?  How does it work?  If you want to get mad at the text, that's ok, but it's very hard to do both things at once unless you are very very good at both things.  Imagine being an anthropologist and you unearth a sacrificial knife and, instead of trying to figure out what it is or how it works, you just got real mad at how the knife was probably used to kill people and is, in a very real way, a kind of manifestation of human cruelty or something.  I think we can probably safely say (1) sacrificing human beings is cruel and (2) that kind of attitude is not going to function very well within the context of a certain kind of study.  Now, it's worth saying here that Nietzsche, as an author, is in many ways the anthropologist who gets mad at the knife, but I take it that Nietzsche's value (if he has any) is the way he wields that anger as a rhetorical and conceptual tool to talk about what it is to be mad at something (and to love something, etc.).  Anyway, i's a book by a dead guy.  You just gotta chill TF out - at least until you can be mad and careful at the same time."

It's a fallacy where one argues that X is justified because Y, but the problem is that Y is created by the very people arguing that X is justified so they can have a justification for it.  At first I thought the term \"self-validation\" could apply, but according to this webpage ... https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/pieces-mind/201407/self-validation ... that's a different concept. After that, I thought about using the term \"self-justification,\" but while this fallacy may be a type of self-justification, that phrase encompasses every circumstance where you justify your own actions, even when your arguments are valid.  Here's an example of the sort of fallacy I'm thinking of: In the USA, African Americans are, bar none, the most common victims of police brutality, especially in fatal encounters. Statistically, that fact is undisputed. However, to counter this, some police and advocates of them argue that police killings of black people is not out of racism per se, but rather, because black people are statistically more likely to commit violent crimes than whites. Thus, these people argue, black people are more likely to put police in an ultimatum where they realistically feel that it's kill or be killed.  Now, obviously, that can be considered RAF (racist as sex) in its own right, so to back up their claims, they cite the arrest rates across the USA. Although blacks make up a disproportionate amount of police shootings in the USA, they also make up a disproportionate amount of violent crime arrests, and ...  ... and this next part is very important ...  ... the rate at which blacks are arrested for violent crimes is on par with the rate at which they get shot by police!  https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-black-americans-commit-crime  Well, that all sounds well and good, except for one problem: The police - a.k.a. the very people killing the black people in these statistics - are the same people who decide who to arrest!  Hell, that Channel 4 article doesn't even cite conviction rates! It only cites arrest rates!      38.5 per cent of people arrested for murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault were black ... We\u2019re talking about arrests not convictions  Innocent until proven guilty?! Never heard of it!  Another good example of this sort of fallacy at work comes from the novel \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.\" Specifically, this excerpt right here:      \"I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I had planned,\" said Professor Trelawney, sitting with her back to the fire and gazing around. \"The fates have informed me that your examination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give you sufficient practice.\"      Hermione snorted.      \"Well, honestly... 'the fates have informed her' who sets the exam? She does! What an amazing prediction!\" she said, not troubling to keep her voice low. Harry and Ron choked back laughs.  So what exactly would this sort of logical fallacy be called? Where you argue your actions are justified based on evidence that you yourself have a lot of influence, if not total control, over.\n\nAssistant:"

Black people are arrested at higher rates.  Therefore black people commit more crimes.  The problem is the soundness of the argument. Premise one is false. The argument isn't sound. The conclusion follows from the premises, but the truth of premise one is dubious. Just because a group of people are arrested (or convicted) more often, doesnt mean they are committing more crime. A probabilistic argument might fail as well, but I'm not going to get into that (because even if it didn't fail, that doesnt mean that just because a conclusion is more likely than not to be true, that it is in fact true, and we can give evidence as to why in the case of black people, it could be an exception).  You should probably try your luck at /r/whatstheword and give the Harry Potter example. What you're describing is something in the conceptual family of \"self fulfilling prophecy,\" but it isn't that.  All you need to do to respond to people making this sort of argument (whether verbatim or after you boil down what they've said) is inform them why premise one is false, and perhaps give a different argument:  Sometimes it is the case that if a group of people is arrested at disproportionately higher rates than others, it is because they are an over targeted demographic, and not because they are committing more crime.  Black people are arrested at disproprtionately higher rates than others.  Therefore, it might be the case that black people are really just an over targeted demographic and not really committing more crime.

This is commonly assumed but I don't see why. Assuming by logic you mean what philosophers do - i.e. deductive formal logic - then you are already accustomed to not using logic for *all* your argumentative purposes; even the most steadfast logician acknowledges that other types of arguments, like inductive arguments, have their place. So perhaps when we reason about what logic we ought to adopt we should not be doing this with the use of logic, but from another standpoint, e.g. inductive inferences or abductive inferences.   In fact, Stewart Shapiro explicitly suggests abduction as the way to choose your correct logic(s) in his new (2015) book *The Varieties of Logic*. He's not alone in this by any means, but that's the easiest and most famous up to date reference.   There's also a lot of work on what people are calling *anti-exceptionalism about logic*, which is the view that logic ought to be treated as any other theoretical inquiry is instead of having a special methodology. If that's the case, then you will almost certainly use the same theory choice principles that you use for empirical theories, which won't themselves (hopefully) beg logical questions."

I would say that you can also trace some key lines of thinking in later continental philosophy to Nietzsche. See, for example, \"Of Truth and Lies in the Non-Moral Sense\" to find a very strong precursor (or ouright pioneering) of later 20th century ideas.   In my opinion, it must be mentioned that Heidegger acted as a sort of \"Bridge\" fanboying Nietzsche pretty early and positioning him as the \"highest and closing point of Western Metaphysics\" (and positioning himself as the starting point of something new) and publishing a damn brick of a book with all his lessons about Nietzsche that was a very very \"hip\" book to have read in the European continent in the later 20th century.

Some people in philosophy think that events are by definition things that happen in space and time. Some people argue that the Big Bang does not happen in space and time since space and time exist only after the Big Bang. Therefore, the Big Bang happened but does not meet the philosophical, technical definition of an event. 99.9% of people on Earth define 'event' along the lines of 'something that happened', and even philosophers who think that the Big Bang doesn't count as an event in the technical, philosophical sense would agree that the Big Bang satisfies the normal meaning of the word 'event'."

Likewise, we can't infer conclusions about cats from premises that contain only information about dogs and not information about cats, and so on. (Modulo the pedant's objection about addition or explosion.)  The typical objection from a popular audience seems to be that we can infer a normative conclusion from merely descriptive premises, when there is an implicit premise which is normative. For instance, people will often give supposed counter-examples like this, \"If I torture people for no reason, they will suffer for no reason, therefore I ought not to torture people\", which they take to follow on the intuitive premise that we implicitly grant that we oughtn't cause people to suffer for no reason. But of course this isn't actually  an objection, since this is a case where we're inferring a normative conclusion from premises that include a normative premise rather than from those that don't--that the normative premise was implicit doesn't make it any less a premise.  The typical objection from a more philosophically sophisticated audience seems to be that we cannot really speak of merely descriptive premises, or at least that in relevant scenarios we often are not speaking of merely descriptive premises, but rather that what we might normally call merely descriptive premises actually come with significant normative implications from the get-go. It seems to me that this is no more a valid objection than is the popular objection, and for the same reason.  I suspect the difficulty is that people sometimes mistake Hume for saying something much broader than he's actually saying."

I'm now into the chapter on  Niels Bohr, and it seems, Rhodes here takes care to make a point about Bohr's strong interests in philosophy.

Hossenfelder is correct that physics needs philosophy (there are philosophical assumptions in any scientific enterprise); however, I doubt it's a lack of philosophizing that prevents progress in particle physics.  First of all, when Hossenfelder talks about physics \"stalling\", she is referring specifically to HEP (high energy physics) theory. HEP theory is, all things considered, only a small part of physics in terms of the number of physicists working on it. If we take some other field, such as condensed matter or plasma physics, there is no \"stalling\" as far as I can see. Similarly astronomy seems to be in a good shape, with the James Webb telescope due to be launched next year. Even in particle physics, there is a fair bit of work going in to formalizing quantum field theories.  On the topic of HEP theory or fundamental particle physics, it may be that it's the lack of philosophical insight that is hindering us from creating a better theory. But this seems like an unlikely explanation for many reasons. Firstly, there are, in fact, many physicists who are interested in philosophy -- for example, most people who work in philosophy of physics have a physics degree. Nima Arkani-Hamed, a highly respected particle physicist, has given lectures on the philosophy of fundamental physics (not academic philosophy, but philosophy in the sense of explaining his reasoning for working the way he does), see here; he actually discusses your question in a roundabout way.  Second, there is actually hardly a shortage of ideas for unification of QM and GR, even rather wild ideas. What is really lacking is the experimental data. It is expected that quantum gravity is very difficult to detect, which means that you need high-energy machines to find indications of it. But high-energy machines are extremely expensive to build, and the only entities that would build them are governments. So it's not so easy to get more useful experimental data out.  It may be that Hossenfelder is right and she is the \"only physicist who has at least come up with an idea for what to do\" (as she claims), but if this is the case, I have to wonder where Hossenfelder's own fantastic breakthroughs are. If she knows the way forward, why isn't she doing it? Her advice is to \"resolve inconsistencies\", as though that isn't a two-word description of the search for unification -- which is exactly what people have been trying to do in the 40 years in which physics supposedly stalled.  None of this is to say, by the way, that many physicists don't take a lax attitude to philosophy, or that there shouldn't be more diverse  funding in e.g. fundamental physics. One could make a justified argument that string theory has been over-funded, though I have the sense that is changing (it's a tempting field, because string theorists only require papers and pens, and thus very little funding!)"

It begins with:  > And whatever you do, in word or in deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.  It then continues to instruct everyone to a life of servitude and submission; wives submit to husbands, husbands serve wives, children obey parents, fathers encourage children.  Verses 22-24 then summarize with an even more astonishing command:  > Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything, not only to please them while they are watching, but with sincerity of heart and fear of the Lord. **Whatever you do, work at it with your whole being, for the Lord and not for men**,\u00a0because you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as your reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.  This command to work with all your effort as if doing work of a transcendent caliber is issued even to servants, who are presumably getting paid little to nothing. This jives with the rest of MLK's quote:  > ...Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will pause to say, 'Here lived a great street sweeper who did his job well. '  Since all productive efforts on this view are done in honor of God, they should all be done soulfully. This teaching is present elsewhere in the New Testament (Ephesians 6:7) and also in the Jewish scriptures (Ecclesiastes 9:10), and the attitude it commends is to apply to everyone.  So, when you ask if this viewpoint still holds today, the answer is: unequivocally yes, so long as you are operating within a Christian worldview.  What if you are not a Christian? Arguably, a virtue ethicist could hold a similar view. If taking all productive efforts seriously produces in one the kind of character which is desirable/necessary/good/moral/whatever, then this is what one should do regardless of pay or opportunity or consequences or duties. In other words, taking such an attitude might make one a better person overall."

The geographical link between the two cultural spheres was the vast area covered first by the Persian Empire and then by the empire of Alexander the Great, through which trade and diplomatic routes developed. The Buddhist scholar Stephen Batchelor remarks that there was no 'East' and 'West' at that time, and that the 'world of the 5th and 4th centuries BCE that extended from Athens to P\u0101\u1e6daliputta was in many respects a single, interactive cultural sphere'.    >   >A central character in this story is the Greek sceptical philosopher Pyrrho of Elis, who around 334 BCE travelled to north-east India with Alexander the Great. He wrote nothing himself, but we know something of his thought through out author's texts. Diogenes Laertius, who documented the lives of Greek philosophers, tells us that meeting Indian sages led Pyrrho 'to adopt a most noble philosophy... taking the form of agnosticism and suspension of judgement', and that this was held to bring with it 'tranquility like its shadow'. One recent, controversial, theory holds that Pyrrho's ideas advocating letting go of all vies actually derive from Buddhism.  &#x200B;  She then goes on to describe a bit more of Pyrrho's life and the Greek ambassador Megasthenes. She ends with:  &#x200B;  >We can't be sure whether there was any direct philosophical influence of India on Greece or Greece on India, and if so what exactly it was, but this remains a fascinating issue that underscores the striking parallels between Buddhism and Stoicism."

I'm trying to understand some of the competing philosophical views on justice, a society based on justice.   Currently I'm reading into Nozick's principles, and I see many flaws with this theory. It would almost seem that \"justice\" is not the correct word for his idea. **But please correct me I'm wrong.**  Here is a list that briefly describes the flaws I've come across, **and please correct me if I'm wrong, or misguided! Also, if possible please share your personal thoughts on Nozick's ideas, and why you agree/disagree with his idea of justice.**  1. It seems that his theory would lead to private tyranny over resources, land, and everything. Eventually the vast majority would become the labor-slaves of the few.   2. He seems to oppose the idea of any central government imposing regulation on businesses which would make this private tyranny all the greater. Without any \"checks or balances\" it would lead to one dominant authority becoming too strong (just emphasizing this point differently).  3. He opposes the idea of taxes, but if we were to completely cut out taxes then there would be no possibility for public schooling, public health care, policing, etc. Wouldn't this force the vast majority to be uneducated low-wage, heavy labor workers? After all, if you can't receive secondary education, how is it possible to become part of the professional class?   4. So it seems he opposes any kind of social welfare, and that would leave donations to be the only alternative. This obviously is problematic.   5. If the society isn't equal, how is this justice?

                "content": " It is important that I split up my responses into three parts/types: (i) Responses from Nozick specifically, as a matter of ideal theory; (ii) responses from libertarianism more generally as a political theory; (iii) the big picture.  Also, there is only so much I can do in a comment. There are many fine points, nuances and arguments Nozick provides for his views on justice. For example, he objects to the term \"distributive justice\" because he thinks it is question-begging; he remarks that most theories of distributive justice fail to take into account giving-rights, and are only theories of recipient justice; he argues against hedonism and for the moral significance of autonomy with his Experience Machine thought experiment; and much more. I can always go into more detail in later comments and forward you to secondary sources on Nozick.   ________________________________________  >It seems that his theory would lead to private tyranny over resources, land, and everything. Eventually the vast majority would become the labor-slaves of the few.   (i) This is safeguarded against by his Lockean Proviso. That is, Nozick's Lockean Proviso prevents people from having rights over resources when there isn't enough and as good left for others. He examines what \"enough and as good left for others\" means in his chapter on the Lockean Proviso.  (ii) Presumably, this would turn on empirical evidence. For example, it turns out that private ownership of property actually benefits people who come after a lot more than it benefits those who got there first. Philosopher David Schmidtz does a lot of work on this question, so here is one of his papers on the institution of property: http://davidschmidtz.com/sites/default/files/research-paper/3/InstitutionProperty2012.pdf  >If the society isn't equal, how is this justice?  (i) Because Nozick's theory of justice is not an egalitarian theory of justice. Indeed, you are assuming that egalitarianism (as a theory of justice) is true. Nozick is arguing that egalitarianism is false. The principal reason why egalitarianism is problematic, on Nozick's view, is that it requires that people's rights be violated.  >What implications would this have with discrimination based on race/ethnicity/culture/ethnicity in society?  (i) Nozick would accept that people have the right to discriminate against others. For instance, since you own your home, you have the right not to let certain people into your home according to whatever justification (or no justification) you see fit. So, strictly speaking, you have a right *not* to allow, say, Hispanics into your home. Forcing you to invite Hispanics over violates your rights. This does **not** mean Nozick thinks people who don't allow Hispanics into their homes are good people, or that he approves of them. Rather, it only means that strictly speaking, these people have a right to do what they are doing, and we have no right to *force them*.   >Wouldn't this just lead to the obvious outcome of serious class warfare?  (i) It depends on what you mean by \"warfare.\" Warfare, e.g., physical violence between persons, is prohibited. Otherwise, individuals have the right to voluntarily associate in whichever way they please, and may feel whatever they want about others.   >Above all, I feel that his theory seems to completely ignore any possibility for social justice. Was this his intention?  (i) In some sense, \"yes\". This is because Nozick, and libertarians in general, take it that fulfilling the requirements of social justice requires us to *violate people's rights*. For example, redistributing wealth from one person to another in the name of equality and social justice *violates* a person's rights. Why? Because you are stealing from them, and it doesn't matter if you are stealing from them for a good cause. Of course, Nozick has underlying moral reasons for believing this. For example, he thinks that taking from one person and giving it to another\u2014even if it is for a good cause\u2014treats people as mere means to an end, rather than as ends in themselves. This comes from Immanuel Kant's moral philosophy.  (i) Also, one of Nozick's most famous arguments is his Wilt Chamberlain argument. The conclusion of this argument is that in order to fulfill the requirements of theories of distributive justice (like egalitarianism) requires us to constantly interfere with people's liberty and violate their rights. See my well-upvoted writeup from this week on it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/4d5p55/how_do_other_political_ideologies_respond_to/d1o4nn  >So it seems he opposes any kind of social welfare, and that would leave donations to be the only alternative. This obviously is problematic.  (i) Nozick would ask, *is it not also problematic that we violate people's rights?*   It's worth noting that a lot of people are concerned about these kinds of issues (you, for example) and that there is little stopping you, under Nozick's theory, from creating your own community where a condition of being part of this community is paying certain fees to make sure everyone is adequately provided for. Of course, under Nozick's theory, people *also* have the right to create other separate communities where there are no such fees. Indeed, people are 100% free to create socialistic communities, like Kubbitzim, or create capitalistic ones. Nozick's minimal state allows all these different communities to *coexist* by providing a minimal framework for them. The problem is that some people want to *force* others to comply with their vision of society. For example, you want to *force* others to pay a fee to provide for others.   (ii) It's not clear that this would be \"obviously problematic.\" For instance, many political theorists and economists argue that social welfare programs actually harm the poor or aren't effective means of helping the poor. See, for instance, philosopher Jason Brennan's talk here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WlnTJZtmuI   (ii) Second, it's not obvious that in the absence of governmental social welfare programs, people would be left to simply die in the streets. There are tons of charities and other philanthropic associations dedicated to helping others both with time and money, and presumably there *would be more* if people retained more of their after-tax income or didn't believe that the government was taking care of it. In terms of pure money, Americans donated $360 Billion dollars to philanthropy in 2014, and 64.5 million adults volunteered 7.9 billion hours of service, worth an estimated value of $175 billion.   >then there would be no possibility for public schooling, public health care, policing, etc. Wouldn't this force the vast majority to be uneducated low-wage, heavy labor workers?  (i) This is not true about there being no policing. First, anarchists would hold that there would be private (whether profit or non-profit) policing services (see Huemer, *The Problem of Political Authority* (2013) and this post here). Second, the entire first third of Nozick's book argues how we could have a state without violating people's rights through taxation. So, on Nozick's view, it is false that coercive taxation is the only way to fund a state.  (ii) In addition to the above about philanthropy, libertarians would argue that free markets (as they'd be permitted to exist under libertarianism) lead to the greatest overall prosperity and are the greatest engine for poverty reduction. See this short and fun lecture by one of the world's most cited economists, Xavier Sala-i-Martin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i28cRfsKD-o  Moreover, education is moving away from formal models. Khan Academy, for instance, is completely free, private *non-profit*, and is funded purely through donations and backing by private companies. Wikipedia has made information completely free and accessible to everyone (incidentally, Wikipedia's founder, Jimmy Wales, is a staunch libertarian!).  **cont'd below**"

                "content": " This is an *excellent* example of why a grasp of the original languages in which philosophical texts are written is essential for a truly comprehensive understanding thereof. I'm by no means fluent in German, but I've got enough of the basics for that to have proven very helpful in my own studies of Nietzsche over the years.  A couple of points.   First, about this:  >Zarathustra says he must \"*untergehen*\". Though *Untergang* can be translated as a downfall, a destruction, or a perishing, many translators choose the phrase \"go down\" to translate Zarathustra's speech.  Here's the thing: unlike in English, *all* nouns are capitalized in German. Here is the German text of *Also sprach Zarathustra*. Here is the relevant passage (emphasis in original):  >Ich muss, gleich dir, *untergehen*, wie die Menschen es nennen, zu denen ich hinab will.  Thomas Common renders that:  >Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.  The capitalization of \"GO DOWN\" is presumably intended to capture the emphatic effect of the italics in the original.   There is absolutely no possibility of translating \"*untergehen*\" in that sentence as a noun. It's not capitalized. It can *only* be a verb. The complete predicate is \"muss untergehen,\" which can plausibly translated as \"must set\" (as the sun or other heavenly body), \"must perish,\" \"must sink\" (i.e., go underwater),\" \"must fall,\" \"must decline,\" \"must descend,\" or \"must go down\".   Zarathustra is speaking to the Sun. In English, we can speak of the Sun (and other heavenly bodies) \"setting\" or \"going down\". In a different context, applied only to the sun, \"*untergehen*\" might well be translated \"setting.\" But Zarathustra then says that he, like the Sun, must \"*untergehen*\", deliberately applying the same word to both himself and the sun. I say \"deliberately\" because Nietzsche is far too masterful with a turn of phrase for something like that to have been otherwise. So if we are to capture the truly delightful, lyrical, parallel quality of Nietzsche's prose, a good English translator would try to find some English rendering that uses the same word(s) to speak of both the Sun and Zarathustra.   Unfortunately, in English, to speak of a *person* \"setting\" is. . . a fairly strange thing to say. The connection with the Sun setting is not at all obvious, even in context. Even speaking poetically, it's just not an elegant turn of phrase. So if the English translation is to preserve the parallelism inherent in Nietzsche's truly gorgeous German, a better translation would be \"going down\". Which is how Common does it.   \"*Untergang*\", as such, would almost invariably be translated as a noun. That's what we see at the end of the prologue:  >Also begann Zarathustra's Untergang.  --which Common renders--  >Thus began Zarathustra\u2019s down-going.  We know it's a noun there because it's capitalized, and Common maintains the parallelism with Zarathustra's address to the Sun. \"Down-going\" is a rather unusual noun construction in English (a gerund, like in German), but many of the other words we'd be most likely to use to render \"*Untergang*, e.g., \"downfall,\" \"sinking,\" \"descent,\" \"collapse,\" etc., have distinctly negative connotations. See, for example, *Der Untergang*, the 2004 film) about the end of the Third Reich, which title is translated \"Downfall\" for its English release. Such a rendering would be problematic, at best.  Now Nietzsche might plausibly view this as the beginning of Zarathustra's own \"downfall.\" What happens to Zarathustra after he leaves the mountain. . . isn't awesome. Or at least not entirely so. But it seems pretty clear that such a negative connotation is not the *only* thing he has in mind. After all, when the Sun \"goes down,\" that's not the end of the Sun! Zarathustra is coming down the mountain bringing the fire of wisdom. So there's some real ambiguity in the German that many of the typical English renderings of \"*Untergang*\" don't really capture. Something like \"down-going\" or \"going down\" is more appropriate.  All of which to say that the answer to this question--  >Is this translation intentional?  --is unequivocally \"Yes,\" no matter what else might be going on here. German grammar absolutely requires such a translation.  As to your other question--  > is Nietzsche positioning Zarathustra as some Socratic kind of character?   --I'm not sure the above gives us a particularly clear answer. As you and others have noted, Nietzsche's education makes the idea that he wasn't aware of Socrates or the imagery in *Republic* completely implausible. But the image of the prophet bringing the wisdom of heaven down the mountain to the wretched masses is hardly unique to Plato. Indeed, the myth of Prometheus comes immediately to mind. . . for which there might well be historical and biographical support!  All of which that Zarathustra strikes me as being a more Promethean figure than a Socratic one."

It's a work of *political economy*, not economics, so it doesn't see politics and economics as independent spheres, but as interlinked parts of society. He was also writing a critique and so I don't think his thought fits neatly into one box, though in terms of modern disciplines, I'd say he's closer to sociology than economics.     Look at the layout of Volume One.  The first three chapters are monotonously focused on features of classical economics - and I assume lots of people never make it past chapter three and so assume he's writing really boring economics from a bygone era. Marxists like Harry Cleaver write entire books on the political implications of the first three chapters, but there is more to come.  He focuses on the abstract unit of the commodity, tracing in and out the social processes that make this production, valuation, and allocation possible.   Instead of treating economic categories as facts of nature, he asks, \"How did capital and wage-labour come into existence?\" There are real historic events that set the conditions for this particular kind of economy.  He goes into the process by which money becomes capital, which is a social phenomenon, not a purely economic one. Moving on he describes the conditions under which this process is possible - needing certain historical conditions such as a level of productivity of labor (through technology), and development of the other two forms of capital - merchants capital and usurers capital (in other words, developed markets with a global trajectory, developed institutions of finance, and hoards of accumulated wealth to be invested). Lastly, there needs to be a working class - this isn't a natural category as the stratification of society elsewhere might have a peasant class (which can grow its own food) or slaves (which have no control over their labor). So Marx lays out in broad strokes the *concrete historical events* that ripped the peasantry from traditional subsistence, leaving them \"doubly free\" - \u201cfree in the double sense, that as a free man he can dispose of his labour power as his own commodity, and that on the other hand he has no other commodity for sale\u201d. Those who could make the transition went to the cities to find work in burgeoning factories where the process of deskilling laborers and industrializing labor has started to take hold. *Capital* is full of historical notes, drawing patterns in real life events, which is not something you would expect from a book on the \"science\" of economics.  Next he describes the effect of industrial labor in shaping the bodies and sense of temporality in workers. Here, he almost starts to sound like Foucault (or Foucault sounds like him). Again, instead of essentialized categories of \"labor\", \"worker\", \"capital\", etc. he shows how these categories develop in response to historical forces, including even our perceptions of natural and unnatural, time and space. Then he talks about this new economic mode of production, this ensemble of social relations at the dawn of modernity, reshaped old modes of production, such as shaping agriculture from an agrarian model to another system of capital accumulation, etc. Here he also draws these patterns into theories of colonization, etc. Again, not what you would expect in a work of ***economics***.  &#x200B;  **tl;dr** Marx is writing a critique of political economy, not a work of economics nor a philosophical treatise. To possibly be controversial for the sake of brevity and clarity, I think *Capital* sets up the principles of classical economics to show inconsistencies within those categories, all for the sake of panning out historically to *deconstruct the discipline of economics* itself. Far from a  \"social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services\", Marx demonstrates that the very categories and assumptions upon which classical economics was founded is historically situated - labor, capital, value, property, etc. - tied to this mode of production that was possible only through a series of catastrophes that created the modern working class. I'm guessing that without this series of events, while industrial capital is the source of value, it would still be eclipsed by merchants capital or usurers capital.  **TL:DR** No, *Capital* is a work of political economy and a critique, so it doesn't fit neatly into a category."

You will be detached. So Seneca writes to the young emperor Nero on mercy, saying you should be gentle and merciful, but in the middle of the letter is an attack on compassion. Compassion is this soft thing where you care too much about what\u2019s out there. And they think in that is the seeds of anger, jealously and ultimately cruelty.\n\nAssistant:"

Many people in school complain that they won't ever use the math they learn there, and they're often right about that. But most people accept that math is useful despite the fact that most people don't need more than a passing familiarity with it. Philosophy is useful in the same way, although people are generally less familiar with academic philosophy than they are with mathematics, so they're often unaware of the extent of philosophical contributions to the rest of human knowledge. There are obvious historic contributions that come to mind, but pointing to these contributions often gets you into an unhelpful semantic dispute about what counts as philosophy (eg: does philosophy get the credit for the ideas of Adam Smith?). More recent examples are better for demonstrating the value of the kind of thing universities tend to call philosophy these days. With that in mind, you might point out that much of modern computer science and linguistics is an outgrowth of philosophy of math and philosophy of language (in particular, Frege and his intellectual descendents). Philosophy has historically made and continues to make pioneering contributions to mathematics as well (eg: the developments of modal logic and, to some extent, category theory and proof theory). There are also many contributions that philosophers have made to the sciences, including pioneering work on interdisciplinary issues (eg: the analysis of causation and causal inference, the explication of the notion of mechanism in the life sciences, the clarification of notions of representation used in the cognitive sciences, etc.). Many ethicists have also been influential in the worlds of law and social policy (eg: the influence of people like Peter Singer on animal welfare, or the influence of John Rawls on social policy).  &#x200B;  Of course, there's an argument to be made that philosophy is just inherently worthwhile, that we want to think about philosophical questions for their own sake, but to the extent that disciplines need to justify themselves by showing what good they can do outside of their own area of focus, I think philosophy actually acquits itself rather well."

I believe this is a hostile and useless way to answer, and what's worse, it turns into a knee jerk reaction to any kind of slightly hypothetical question, even if some of them are decent questions if a little hard to understand. In many cases, these questions are answerable, and OP can be told where their misconceptions lie without telling them to go study (at least) 4 years at college before they're allowed to ask questions.

I typically operate under this notion, or at least try my best to, but I think it's equally important to fundamentally understand that informational questions are really often coming from fundamentally emotional places. For better or worse.  Thus, I do think there is full legitimacy to \"seeing through the question\" to where it is coming from emotionally and tailoring your response to that.  However, that being said, I personally dabble in \"physics communication\" and this is something I always struggle with. I'd be very open to people's own thoughts on what the correct stance should be. But how I see it is something like this:  A high-schooler who is coming off a \"high\" based on a new found love for physics based on their most recent Brian Greene book may well ask... well... \"dumb\" questions. Either questions that are answered on a weekly basis, or that are just a mish-mash of not-really-understood concepts thrown together. But the emotional *core* is that of curiosity and inquiry and a legitimate desire to learn more.  Responding with hostility to such a person will only serve to kill the interest of a bright young mind in their first steps into a new area. And, I mean, kids say \"dumb things\", but they're learning.  The flip side to that is \"crack-pottery\". Crack-pottery, in my mind, fundamentally comes from a place of taking an *emotional stance* or constructing an *emotional narrative* and then filling in the \"facts\" later to fill an emotional need. It's a fundamentally bad-faith effort starting from a place of \"I'm a rogue genius and even though there may not be outward evidence of that, \\*I\\* know it\" and then filling in the plot points to fill that emotional narrative retroactively.  It's from these people you get the \"I just read this popular physics book yesterday and learned about quantum gravity and hold my beer you guys, I've just figured this all out for you\" type attitude.  A \"crack pot\" is not looking to be taught or learn. In fact they will resist it because the fundamental core of their journey through physics is that of cognitive bias being applied to mutilate and assemble \"facts\" as required to fulfill an unflappable emotional core.    Thus, in the case of \"crack pots\", the game you're playing in terms of communication and response ISN'T for the benefit of the crack-pot but for the spectators. Although that's not the stance I take, I find it hard to disagree with the notion that hostility intended to make someone withdraw that simultaneously informs a spectator of the errors of their ideas isn't fundamentally.... wrong???.... without value???  I dunno. The policy I try to follow with science communication is to simply not engage the \"crack pots\". The thinking being that any longer conversation will just make us both look increasingly bad as the discussion continues no matter what which then acts to erode the \"authority\" of the communication effort. Getting dragged into mud-slinging makes everyone kinda look like an asshole, and no one likes an asshole and people don't want to learn from people they don't like. But that doesn't mean that in certain cases someone who's \"clamped down\" on someone who's making a bad-faith effort to peddle nonsense isn't doing a service to the whole discourse.  ... Or at least that's kinda how I think about it."

PM english is not my first language.   &#x200B;  Since I read a book when I was 14 about physics I loved physics. I loved the stories the implications and I understood (I think) what the true beauty is about it. I excelled at school in math and physics (and biology) and had a perfect score when I ended high school in Math. However I doubted really strongly that I could do physics, because in my head people who studied physics were probably way smarter then me. I also I didn't want to be seen as a nerd (bad motivation I know). My parents also pressured me into not doing physics and I choose my second idea: medicine.   I like medicine also a lot and I have been a doctor for some years. I love my job, love learning about the body and cracking cases. I dont really like the stressful job times and it can be quite physical demanding. I am 28 years old btw.   During my medicine studies I tried doing some physics courses and the first time I did an exam in a physics course I was shaking in happiness (I was 22 I think). I really tried doing physics next to medicine, but my internships already started and I had to be in the hospital from 9 to 5. Studying in the evening for medicine AND physics was too much. I let go of physics.  &#x200B;  I am now financially in a good situation. Physics is still nagging in my head. People often say I should join medicine and physics love by become nuclear medicine physicist, but I just want to do theoretical physics. I know it sounds bad, but only theoretical physics is my main interest. I like all physics, but I want to truly understand the principles. I love teaching as well and would like to become a teacher on a university.   &#x200B;  However... if I now stop working and start studying physics I will throw away my medicine career. At the point I am now I should choose for a medical specialty, do a PhD or start profilering more in my career. If I quit now I will pass this point.   &#x200B;  The second problem is that in my country they don't allow you to study a second study if you finished your first. Well they allow you but at truly insane rates. I don't have the money for that, and I don't want to go extremely in debt for the study because I am afraid I can't pay it off in the future (because job uncertainty as a theoretical physicist). The option is that I go study 500 km away in a different country where they allow second studies for really low prices, I can easily pay that for a couple of years without working. This will be very difficult for my girflriend, who is still studying in my place, she cant transfer.   &#x200B;  I don't know what to do. The most safe and best bet is to stay a doctor and profilare my carreer. I will have less worreis in life. If I stop it is a true gamble, what if after studying phsyics I cant find a job as a theoretical phsyscist. Also I need to emigrate.   &#x200B;  TLDR I am a doctor but I want to become a theoretcal physics. If I stop working I throw away my medical career. I also need to emigrate to a different country.\n\nAssistant:"

I am very happy I did it, and I finally really love my work, but honestly from most perspectives my life sucks right now. The process has wreaked serious, destructive havoc on my relationships, finances, and free time. My non-physics friends all have houses, kids, regular schedules, vacations, and long term life plans...let's just say I don't. If it's important enough to you to risk all those things, continue looking into it. It is currently worth it to me, but probably is not worth it to most people. And don't try to be a hero or a romantic about this--think about what those things really mean to you, it's probably quite a lot. If you realize it's not worth it, keep watching PBS Spacetime and be thankful that hobbies are fun and optional.  To be more practical, though, what I would suggest is to try some serious online courses. I've found MIT OpenCourseware to be very good for undergrad math, I'm sure the physics is good too. Do the course as if it were a real college course that you'd registered for. If you love it and do well, keep going until you run out of material, then think about all this again.  Also, I would be very concerned that you \"just want to do theoretical physics\". I have a bunch of very smart, very theoretically-minded friends who felt that way and then switched to experiment (or quit) because they realized they don't actually like the day to day work of being a theorist. If you had said something like \"I really want to study BPS Hall algebras of scattering Hall states\" I'd still be very skeptical, but a little less so. Theoretical physics is not sitting around thinking about wormholes. The \"cool\" stuff basically turns into nothing but really hard math really quickly, and even that never occupies as much of your day as you'd like. Some people do end up loving it, but it's a much smaller percentage than you'd think. (Also, the job market for theorists who want to stay in physics is pretty awful.)"

                "content": "\n\nHuman: The Physics of Double Jumping (Attempt #2) So, I was trying to figure out the exact physics behind the video game mechanic known as \"Double Jumping,\" which, for those who don't know, consists of the character jumping into the air and then, somehow, jumping again, apparently jumping off the air itself. Now, while this is physically impossible to do for a normal human, we're not talking about normal people. We're talking about superhuman fictional characters.  &#x200B;  Now, last time I attempted this, in my previous post on here, I suggested the possibility that maybe one could pull of a Double Jump by pressing one's feat down on the air with such Force and Pressure that it became solid Nitrogen, which they could then leap off of. Thanks to the replies I received, I realized a variety of issues with that idea, but the most notable was that even if such a platform could be made, it would not be braced against anything, and thus wouldn't be something one could leap off of regardless.     Thankfully, there were alternative methods of lift that were suggested by those who made comments on my last post, some of which I considered. I looked at the physics of Rockets, but unfortunately, without you throwing a sizable amount of matter downwards, you could not Double Jump with that method. Similarly, next I looked at the physics of how birds fly, but once again it couldn't really be applied in this circumstance, as it seems birds achieve lift through a specific method of abusing the laws of physics, specifically through using a specific wing shape called an \"air foil,\" or something like that, which doesn't seem applicable in our theoretical situation of a human jumping off of the air.  &#x200B;  So, following that up, I came up with a second attempt at approaching this, and I would love to hear some feedback on it. In our theoretical Double Jump, suppose that the human in question kicked downwards with such force that it created a shockwave, and this shockwave then moved towards the ground, bounced off it, and then the returning shockwave pressed up against the person's feat and carried them upwards. From what I understand of shockwaves, they just require one to put a large amount of energy into the air in a short period of time, and in addition those waves can be more than strong enough to lift a person.   &#x200B;  I actually ran the numbers already, and given a person weighing 62 kg, gravity would be pressing them downwards with a Force of 608.22 Newtons. Assuming the soles of their feet, together, have an area of about 0.044 m\u00b2, that would mean the shockwave would have to be exerting pressure of about 13823.182 Pascals in order to match the Force of Gravity. Supposing that, after the first jump, they are 4.572 meters in the air, that would mean the shockwave would have to travel 4.572 meters to the ground and then 4.572 meters back up to the person. For the purposes of this, assuming the energy was completely conserved after reflecting off of the ground, that would mean the shockwave will have traveled a total distance of 9.144 meters. Using the inverse square law (which I'm assuming is still applicable in this circumstance), combined with the handy Alex Wellerstein NUKEMAP calculator, I found that, in order to create such a shockwave, the person would have to be kicking out with 8368000 Joules of Energy, which is approximately equivalent to 8.4 Dynamite Sticks exploding simultaneously.  &#x200B;  Now, aside from the idea that the shockwave would reflect off the ground without any loss of energy, which I would adjust for provided that this method is reasonable, does this sound like a solid explanation for this \"Double Jump\" in terms of the physics? And yes, I understand that no human could ever produce this sort of Energy with a jump. I just want to know, if they WERE to pull off a Double Jump, if this explanation seems like the most likely and/or the most feasible. So if you see any flaws in my explanation/regarding the physics involved with this, or if there's some major oversight I missed, or if you've got your own ideas or explanations for how the physics of a Double Jump could work, please let me know! This makes sense to me, and it seems to be more physically sound than turning the Nitrogen into a platform, but I still want to hear what you smart people think. Thank you for your assistance in this thought experiment!\n\nAssistant:"

Running a research group requires a comparable amount of dedication to running a small company -- and tech companies pay between 2x and 4x what you can earn as a researcher.  I know this because throughout my career I've been recruited fairly consistently in that range compared to my salary as I've advanced.  I remain in close touch with a friend of mine from undergrad, who \"dropped out\" with a bachelor's degree in physics, to be a laboratory technician in industry (while I went on to the Ph.D.).  He has consistently found interesting work, has advanced throughout his career, and now runs a lab of his own.

When gravity is coupled to quantum systems, things become even more difficult. Additional requirements are needed and the previous ones are usually changed to some degree. All of these goes under the name of swampland conjectures, because to hold them as true allows to distinguish between a theory that can be coupled to quantum gravity and one that can't (it's said it's in the swampland).

Now the m doesn't cancel, instead the acceleration will be proportional to q/m. Therefore, different bodies will accelerate differently in an electromagnetic field.

The basic thermal energy balance equation for a planet's atmosphere is:  (Rate of change of thermal energy) = (Sunlight in) - (Infrared out)  For a stable climate the left side is zero and the two terms on the right balance, but not in this case.  The rate of change of thermal energy is given by the heat capacity of the atmosphere:  Rate of change of thermal energy = M Cp dT/dt  where M is the mass of the atmosphere, Cp is its specific heat capacity, and dT/dt is the rate of change of temperature.  Since the vast majority of the mass of the atmosphere is near the surface, we're just going to use the surface temperature, T = T_s.  For the infrared out term, the Stefan-Boltzmann law applies:  Infrared out = sigma A (T_e)^4  where sigma is the S-B constant, A is the surface area of the planet, and T_e is its *emission temperature*.  This is *not* the surface temperature: because of Venus's strong greenhouse effect, infrared energy from the surface is absorbed by the atmosphere before it escapes to space, and it's the colder atmosphere higher up that actually emits to space.  For Earth T_s and T_e differ by 10% or so on the Kelvin scale, but Venus's greenhouse effect is so huge that T_s = 700 Kelvin, T_e = 184 Kelvin -- a factor of 3.8.  Let's call this factor gamma = T_s / T_e.  Because this effect depends mostly on the *mass of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere*, I'm going to assume for now that this factor stays the same as the atmosphere starts to cool.  So now we've got a differential equation we can solve:  M Cp dT_s / dt = - sigma A (T_s)^4  / gamma^4  dT_s / dt = - sigma A / (M Cp gamma^4 )] (T_s)^4  Notice how Venus's large greenhouse effect (big gamma) and large mass M really slow down the cooling rate compared to Earth.  For Venus:  sigma = 5.67e-8 W m^2 K^4  A  = 4.6e14 m^2  M = [5e20 kg  Cp = 843 J/(kg K) for CO2  gamma = 3.8  Here's a plot of the solution to that differential equation, starting at T_s = 700 K:  https://imgur.com/tSGdcWu  You can see that Venus cools to Earthlike temperatures over half a million years or so.  But there's a problem with my calculation: at some point in this process, parts of the atmosphere are going to hit the freezing point of CO2.  Dry ice clouds will form, dry ice snow will start to fall.  This causes a bunch of problems: on the one hand, it reduces the amount of gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect, so my assumption that \"gamma\" was constant will stop being true.  On the other hand, freezing a substance releases energy, which needs to be accounted for in my differential equation.  The first effect shortens the cooling time, the second one lengthens it.  But the equation above at least predicts that it'll be hundreds of thousands of years before Venus even gets to the point where freezing CO2 becomes an issue.  Oh, and this is just the time to cool the atmosphere itself.  The upper part of the rocky crust also needs to cool, which will lengthen the cooling time even more.  You can find much more on the energy balance of planets, including this dry ice snow issue, in Principles of Planetary Climate by Pierrehumbert.

Using water allows us to use it's density (and therefore it's mass, assuming we have a known volume of it) to determine the acceleration due to gravity (the same could be done using any known mass, such as an object known to be a kilogram). The string and the weight allow us to construct a pendulum. The period of a pendulum is given by T=2\u03c0\u221a(L/g), where T is the period for harmonic motion, L is the length of the string, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. The only sources of error here would be the precision in your scale, density fluctuations due to temperature, and air pressure/air resistance in the pendulum/spring scale systems. However, you would likely be able to construct a crude way of measuring time accurate within a few seconds every hour.   From this, I would then attempt to find a method of measuring longer periods of time. Since candles burn at a relatively steady rate, you could time how far a candle burns in 1 minute using the pendulum, then use this to measure longer increments. Another method that has been used for a long time (and still is today) is an hourglass. These methods would have slightly additional error from the pendulum, but are much better than having to count an hour using a pendulum (and honestly, if you're stuck on another planet without a way of telling time, what's a few seconds difference?).  Other than this, measuring some spectroscopic quantity would be the best method (and is the current SI standard, a second being defined by the transitions between two atomic states of Cesium).

The starting point for QFT is a classical field theory, and then just like in QM commutation relations are imposed on the classical field theory's degrees of freedom (that is to say, we imagine that the degrees of freedom can be replaced with quantum operators and we look to see if the result produces a self-consistent algebra). So QFT is, as the name suggests, a quantum theory for fields.  For *free* QFTs, i.e.: one without any interactions between fields, we can actually do this rigorously and we end up with a Hilbert space which has exactly the same structure as the direct sum of N-particle quantum systems with N ranging from 0 to infinity (this is called a Fock space). This process is sometimes called \"second quantisation\".  Free QFTs are the starting point for a lot of QFT, because if we change the dynamics slightly from a free QFT by introducing weak interactions, then we expect that the resulting theory should look a lot like the free QFT, and thus the Hilbert space will still look a lot like the free Fock space, and all the relevant physical quantities we want to calculate can be obtained as successive approximations off of their free-theory values. This is called perturbation theory.  Because so much of QFT is done in this way, the term \"QFT\" has come to mean the same thing as \"perturbative QFT\" in a lot of contexts by metonymy. But in the strict sense of the term, QFT is broader. Not all effects in QFT can be analysed in terms of particles. These are the \"non-perturbative\" effects of QFT, and they're notoriously difficult to analyse. So I would say QFT is not \"just\" a way of analysing multi-particle systems, although multi-particle systems are an important part of the modern suite of mathematical tools at our disposal for studying quantum fields.  It's actually no coincidence that the multi-particle systems from your lectures look so much like free-field QFTs. After all, these systems arise as non-relativistic limits of actual QFTs. But non-relativistic proper QFTs do exist, and you can also approach free relativistic QFTs from a Fock space/second quantisation/N-particle approach.   Even in interacting QFTs, though, particles or particle-like states remain ubiquitous. Remember how in QM bound states appeared anytime you had potential wells (like for simple harmonic oscillators or the Coulomb potential of the hydrogen atom)? Particles are to QFT what bound states are to QM (except instead of a particle in a potential it's a field's potential term in the Lagrangian). I'm even tempted to say that you should expect particulate behaviour to arise *anytime* you have wells in your Lagrangian potential terms, though don't quote me on that."

Both have their pros and cons.    Sean Carroll has been a vocal proponent of the many worlds interpretation, and though I have nothing but love and admiration for the man, and though his physics prowess is far greater than mine, I\u2019m not at all convinced by his argument that the Everettian many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is the most natural interpretation.    Sure, it\u2019s true that the notion of wavefunction collapse seems artificial, and totally at odds with the otherwise continuous evolution of a system.  This is a big problem that needs to be figured out.   But the many worlds interpretation seems like a philosophical over-extrapolation from a provisional model (not to mention you can always wrap apparently paradoxical physics in a coherent mathematical superstructure if you\u2019re willing to sacrifice parsimony) .  We ought to take quantum mechanics seriously, but we need not take it literally, until it is on more secure ontological footing.  That will probably require deeper insights into the substructure of space and time, and the symmetries of particle physics.  Until we know more about the nature of space, time, and the energy that inhabits and shapes it, it just seems absurd to positively defend the idea that we are actually living in a multiverse, based on an extrapolation of a provisional model which nobody really understands anyway.   We haven\u2019t even figured out the fine structure constant yet.  Who\u2019s to say whether or not other universes exist?  Without any positive evidence, it\u2019s just too soon to credibly make that call.    We should cherish the ambiguity that quantum mechanics has to offer.  In this ambiguity we can mine for truth.  But we should not narrow in too soon on a particular perspective, while there are others which are still equally viable.    It may be that the many worlds interpretation is correct.  If so, then there are probably many worlds in which I believe in the many worlds interpretation, so by doubting it in this world I\u2019m hedging my bets.  I would encourage others to do the same.  Unless, does anyone have a very convincing case for the many worlds interpretation?"

Using rough average numbers, this is around 30% of average latency (Amsterdam/Tokyo average ping time is 250ms; round-trip time for the distance 18.5Km at 0.6c is \\~100ms).  The remaining time is due to the hops the message has to go through. A ping request has to go through multiple routers, which reads the signal from the medium, process the destination address and transmits the signal on the next connection medium (routing/switching).  Finally, there's latency related to congestion - there's a maximum transmission limit on each connection medium, and if too many messages are being processed, then routers store messages for a short time until either processing (queuing) or medium throughput is available (buffering).

In RARE cases a partial HLA match between donor and recipient allow the donor leukocytes to evade the recipient's immune response. This most commonly occurs in related donor/recipient transfusions and deliberately HLA matched transfusions. Both situations require irradiation of the donor blood prior to transfusion. If donor leukocytes survive in the recipient they can engraft and mount their own immune response against the recipient. This condition is called Transfusion Associated Graft vs Host Disease. Transfusion Associated GVHD is nearly always fatal, but can easily be avoided by proper pretransfusion irradiation.   Source- Immunohematology and Transfusion Medicine are my job."

Relative sizes of objects also contributes to this, but can be fooled by objects with odd sizes. Binocular depth perception works best within a set distance from the eye (Vieth\u2013M\u00fcller circle)   BLIND SPOT- The blind spot due to the lack of neuron cell bodies in the optic nerve head is not readily visible to us because the contralateral (other side) eye has this covered and the brain computes this for us.   INFORMATION SHARING- This goes along with the first 2 points. A large percentage of one eye\u2019s axons in the optic nerve traverse at a structure known as the optic chiasm to the opposite side of the brain. The  brain uses this information to give us 1 large picture that is greater in visual angle than either eye alone (\u201ccyclopean eye\u201d).   CONSISTENCY- Bilateral symmetry is pretty common in the nervous system.  WHY NOT MORE?- The eyes, combined with the processing power of the brain, are extremely powerful and more vision isn\u2019t needed. Combining head and eye movement with a slight twist of the torso allows us to see 360 degrees.   NO ROOM IN THE HEAD- Visual perception in the brain occupies a lot of real estate. More than half of the brain is involved in visual processing.   Hope this helps. If interested, I can find you some references for further reading."

You brain interprets the signal as pain and that's how you get the response.  What you're asking is if you cut off your hand immediately after, would you still feel the pain from smashing your hand.  The answer is that it depends on if you cut off the hand before or after the signal has passed the point that you're cutting at.  If the signal hasn't yet reached the point that you cut off, then it will not get to the brain, and will not be interpreted as pain.

For reconstructing the appearance of dinosaurs or other fossil organisms we have a few useful tools at our disposal.   First, bones can tell you a lot about the appearance of muscle tissue. Muscle attachment sites on bones give some pretty great indication of muscle size and position in the body. Determining these muscle features takes a lot of careful work. Look at work by Oliver Demuth if you want to see a good example of reconstructing muscle from bone features.  Next up, skin and feather appearance. We have actually some great examples of both fossilized for several dinosaurs, so that helps with reconstructions a lot. Search up Leonardo the Brachylophosaurus, the nodosaur Borealopelta or thr Psittacosaurus at the Senckenberg museum. These dinosaur mummies show us almost exactly what these animals looked like in life. For feathers there are great examples of smaller  theropod dinosaurs perfectly preserved with them from places like the Jehol Biota in China, but also larger animals with them such as ornithomimids from Canada or the tyrannosaur Yutyrannus Liaoning Province in China. We suspect many theropods had feathers as we keep finding older examples of feather bearing ones, which would suggest it is a common feature in the group as if the oldest ones were feathered it stands to make sense that thwir descendants would have feathera commonly. Even non theropods had feather like structures, possibily feathers themselves, suggesting they were a widespread feature in all dinosaurs.  Next up, colour. The science behind this is newer but oretty cool. Basically pigment granules called melanosomes exiat in flesh to give it colour (among other things). It turns out these melasomes fossilize and through microscopic techniques you can actually look at their distribution, abundance and variety in fossil skin or feathers to determine the colour of the animal. I will mention Borealopelta again. This dinosaur has melasomes present in such a way to indicate that it was browniah coloured on top and lighter coloured on its stomach. The birdlike Anchiornis is another good example. Most fossils do not preserve these pigments, though, so colour in reconstructions is often based off of living animals.  Next, we use whats called the extant phylogenetic bracket to determine appearances of things we aren't too sure about, to inform our science by comparing dinosaur bones to their closest living relatives. Dinosaurs are archosaurs, meaning they sit in the same family group as crocodiles and birds (which are dinosaurs themselves). Because of this, there are likely a lot of things the tisssues and bones of these animals could tell us about how they looked, moved and other things. We'll alao take a look at other loving animals to see features that may or may not fossilize exactly, like the lips of a monitor lizard or the trunk of an elephant, and see if there are unlooked clues in bones for such things.  Modern palaeoart is often a pretty accurate depiction of dinosaurs and other prehistoric life. Thinking of the palaeoartists I know and follow, they're all palaeontologists themselves and do hours and hours of scientific research in order to make the best reconstruction they can, often collaborating closelt with the authors of studies they are making their art for. Colour choices or elaborate feather displays may be a bit subjective but they're certainly not unfounded. So while these reconstructions may not be exactly what the animal looked like, they're likely pretty close in most cases.  Hopefully this helps and isn't a garbled mess. I just woke up and was very excited to write this!"

In adults, cells are usually slower, so cancers take longer to develop and don\u2019t eat up the cytotoxic medications as fast.   2) people with genes that promote childhood cancers are likely to be selected out and die early before they propagate their genes, over many many years in history. So these genes are not common until they break through or the mutations happen a new.   On the other hand, older-age cancers are not being selected out because they breed before they get the cancer, and most of them represent build up of mutation over life time rather than an inborn genetic tendency."

I know the basics of how a surfactant works, but I was curious about how much those properties matter in relation to actually cleaning a human body.  Does using a rough surface like a loofah or stone change how clean you get your body when showering? If you use the surface of a bar of soap to 'scrub', does it having a clean/slick surface change how effectively the soap cleans your skin?\n\nAssistant:"

If your hand is covered in mud, you make just as much progress using water to rinse it off and scrubbing before using soap. The soap will very likely contribute nothing to getting the mud off, and you'd really only want to use it afterwards to get any weird bacteria off of your hand after bathing them in mud. If your hand is covered in cooking oil or motor oil, you would very likely need to scrub for so long so hard that you might wind up causing some skin irritation."

            {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": " Air pressure is part of the correct answer, but there is more to it and let me explain why.  It boils down to a few things (in no particular order):  1. Airspeed vs. Groundspeed 2. Weather 3. Traffic 4. Fuel efficiency  Firstly, an aircraft at 35,000 feet doesn't really care how fast it is moving with respect to the ground (groundspeed).  It does care how fast it is moving with respect to the medium through which it is flying (airspeed).  Generally speaking (this is simplified), the higher you are, the thinner the air is, and the faster you will move with respect to the ground for a given airspeed.  This is because with thinner air, you have fewer air molecules hitting the airplane for a given speed over the ground and thus you can travel faster over the ground before you run into structural issues with the aircraft.  For example, on a standard day (29.92 inHg barometric pressure, 15C/59F temperature) at sea level with no wind, if you're traveling at 250 kts through the air, you're traveling at 250 kts over the ground.  On that same day, with no wind, at 35,000 feet, at the same airspeed, you're travelling at in excess of 400 kts over the ground.  If you want me to expand in a further post about the difference between True Airspeed and Indicated Airspeed as well as Mach Number, Coffin Corner and why planes don't fly even higher, let me know and I will.  Second, flying higher gives you a few bonuses with regard to weather.  First, it makes it easier to take advantage of wind.  Generally speaking (and up to a limit), the higher you get, the stronger the winds are.  If you're rocking a 30 kt tailwind at 7,000 ft you might be able to pick up a 50 kt tailwind at 18,000 ft and a 100 kt tailwind at 35,000 ft.  A 100 kt tailwind component means you're going 100 kt faster over the ground.  Also, flying higher makes it easier to avoid nasty weather. While it's not at all uncommon for a thunderstorm to top out at 40,000 or even 50,000 feet being higher generally makes it easier to go over or around.  Also, once you get high enough you tend to be above significant cloud formations in the colder months, which reduces risks associated with ice buildup.  That and any visible moisture is more than likely frozen to begin with up high, which is a significant help.  Most transport category aircraft are reasonable at dealing with icing, but you still want to avoid it.  Third, the traffic element.  At least in the United States, when you get above about 10,000 feet you tend to leave most of the smaller traffic behind (and the speed limit increases from 250 kts to just shy of Mach 1).  Once you're flying above 18,000 feet, all aircraft are operating on an instrument flight plan under the guidance of air traffic control.  This has an added safety benefit in that center controllers are pretty good about keeping 2 planes operating IFR from occupying the same space at the same time.  Finally, there's a benefit in terms of fuel consumption.  I'm not a chemist.  If a chemist wants to step in and talk about stoichiometry they're more than welcome to do so, but in essence there is an optimal ratio of fuel to air for combustion.  So, as you get higher and the air gets less dense, for a given volume of air that is taken into an engine, less fuel is needed for combustion.  Fuel is expensive and airplanes burn a LOT of it so anything that results in less fuel consumption tends to be a good thing.  This all combines to make flying at a higher altitude a significantly better proposition than flying lower."

This distinction is not really relevant to casual exercisers or dieters.  To illustrate: A lb of fat is 3500 calories. So to lose a lb of fat a week you need a calorie deficit of 500/calories a day.  You can have a 500/cal deficit without any exercise or without exercising for greater than 30 minutes. In other words, your body also burns fat stores when you eat at a caloric deficit, otherwise no one would lose weight from starvation."

Note that there is a lot of overlap in the frequency sensitivity of these cones, they are just tuned to slightly different frequencies at their peaks.

Returning to your sealed-container question, the two factors are this:  1. The sealed container has the same size (displaces the same amount of water) no matter what the pressure inside is. 2. The more you compress the air in the tank, that means you're adding more and more air molecules into the tank. The mass of the object (container+contents) is rising as pressure rises.

But the reason why it typically doesn't make the news is because typically no one even writes a paper or publishes the results about it. The reason why that is actually quite interesting and weird if you don't quite understand why it happens.  First you have to understand is that we only really need 39 digits of to calculate the circumference of the known universe to the width of a hydrogen atom. So the question is if we don't need more digits, why do we keep trying to calculate more digits?  The reason is we are testing our machines(servers, data centers and super computers) for failures. Manufacturing computers is hard to do completely reliable. Failure rates for computer parts can be between 0.5 percent to 5 percent in some cases. And failure of electronic hardware is a bit weird. Normally you assume that the computer hardware has a higher chance to fail as the hardware gets older. While that is true, it also doesn't show the whole story.  Essentially electronic hardware has what is known as Early Infant Mortality Failures(EIMF). These are failures that happen due to some manufacture flaw that happened during the manufacturing process. So these electronic hardware will fail early compared to their expected life time. But as time goes on, with the hardware being used, the likely hood of it suffering from EIMF goes down. So the over all failure rate over the cycle of a piece of electronic hardware looks something like this.  Now we can see that hardware can fail early. And if say a server that is storing or processing important data at the time of failure, you might lose that data, have it become corrupted or just lose time.  So when Google, Microsoft or even Amazon or any data center or server provider worth their salt and super computer providers will have a period of time where they will be putting new hardware through some very computationally heavy workloads to try and get the hardware that will suffer from EIMF to fail. This is so they don't have the hardware fail when it is important they don't fail.  At Google, I know from friends who have worked there, that they typically give their software engineers the chance to run computationally hard work on their new hardware before they they bring that hardware into service with their existing servers. But they do so with the understanding that the work ran cannot be for critical work related stuff. For example, they cannot be running a neural network that they are working on for a work project. Pretty much, pet projects only since you have a chance to not get a result back.  But they can run calculating Pi or other constants. Or finding primes or other weird math stuff. Even when they don't have engineers wanting to run computational heavy pet projects, they sometimes run calculating Pi.  And because they are doing these calculations just to get hardware to fail early, they don't care about the results. So they won't make papers on the subject."

Short answer: yes.  The initial radiation takes the form of gamma and neutron radiation - this radiation dissipates relatively quickly (lasts about the length of the explosion). Very few injuries would result from initial radiation alone - as most people affected by this also happen to be close to ground zero and have other worries (e.g. giant fireball).  Fallout is what comes next. There are hundreds of fissile products that can be formed from a nuclear blast - some with a very short half-life (like iodine 131), and some that will stick around for months or years (like strontium 90). This can come from the weapon debris (e.g. \"leftover\" plutonium), products from the fission itself, and much of it will be from irradiated soil (assuming you're detonating it near the ground).  So, I think your question is more about the after-effects - so to answer: the radiation you're seeing that has long term effects is from the fallout.  edit: Grammar - as per Vanabrus :)"

Unfortunately, in our modern society we have largely conquered our hostile environment and so this negativity instinct no longer serves us so well as it once did.  In fact, it can cause us a lot more harm today than good.  It tends to leave us with a lot of emotional baggage later in life that can really weigh us down and can even provoke self-defeating behavior patterns.    Our natural tendency to obsessively ruminate over past traumas and mistakes can cause depression, insecurity, addictive escapism, anger problems, sociability disfunction, career problems, etc.  It takes a lot of counter-instinctual emotional maturity and mental discipline to stop ourselves from dwelling too much on mistakes and regrets and instead to focus on positive aspirations, optimism, and hope."

Loki needs to acquire both an amount of iridium and access to a power source (Stark Tower's arc reactor) to generate the second portal. How was the first portal generated without these two prerequisites?  Secondly, if he could do that once, why could he not simply do it again immediately to send the Chitauri through?  Third, on a more strategic/tactical note, why did Thanos bother sending Loki at all? Why not simply go himself? He's orders of magnitude more physically powerful. The Tesseract was fifteen, maybe twenty metres away from the portal it generated. Thanos could walk through basically any human weapon fire, pick it up and walk back through the first portal without breaking a sweat and have two Infinity Stones for the Gauntlet immediately. The Space Stone would allow him to teleport anywhere in the universe instantly, meaning he could claim the other stones (excepting the Soul Stone) with minimal effort. Instead, he lost an entire Chitauri army, the Mind Stone and his element of surprise against peer or near-peer opponents such as Thor and the Sorceror Supreme.   Why the theatrics?\n\nAssistant:"

The lawyer made the case that Mr. Incredible caused him undue suffering and distress--which is Mr. Incredible's fault for not saving him the right way. If Mr. Incredible had saved him more competently, the man would not be in constant pain, would have a higher quality of life, and would not have sued--but that's not what happened, so now he's suing for damages.  The successful suit set precedent that superheroes can be successfully sued by the people they save for not doing it the right way (\"I've had nightmares ever since!\" Yeah, no kidding; you were in a traumatic event. The fact that you're alive to have those nightmares is all due to this guy. But you don't like it, and you're facing a mound of medical bills that you don't know how to pay, and you've lost your job because you're not sleeping at night and started nodding off at work... so you sue to try to make ends meet, and to pay for the therapies you need).  This made it a tremendous liability for any hero to save anyone. One could argue that the superheroes were not obligated to show up and defend themselves against frivolous suits: they are, after all, incognito. However, failure to respond to a legal summons would (a) make sure that you lost the case and, most importantly, (b) would lead to the superhero having a warrant out for their arrest, whether for failure to appear in court or for failure to pay the legal settlement. Further, (c) superheroes are, generally, extremely loyal to the law, and would likely show up and abide by the ruling even if there were no downside to refusing to show, because that's just who they are. If they cast aside the law when it no longer suits them, then they're no better than the villains they apprehend.  Thus superheroes, faced with either paying huge legal fees and settlements or becoming outlaws, chose to retire. The few who did not retire quickly became outlaws, leading to the passage of laws that made superheroism illegal.*  *I believe superheroes were made illegal in the movie. I haven't seen it in a long time, so I could be wrong about that."

Why Vader doesn\u2019t just force choke, mid-fight or why they don\u2019t use the force to turn their opponents light saber off.

As a justification, it was said that it was against religion and all that, but the main material reason behind it was that there were lots and lots of people, mainly of clerical origin, who made a living by copying texts by hand. As the ulema (clerical) class had a sizable influence on the state, they remain banned for more than two centuries.  The first Muslim owned printing press was opened by Ibrahim Muteferrika in 1727.

Of course, being introduced in the 19th century, it wasn't considered controversial that the character was a close parallel to American blackface, which saw its earliest incarnations around the same time. But unlike the US, Belgium didn't abolish slavery in its colonial territories until 1909, whereas it was abolished in the US in 1860. After the abolition in the US, it was still legal to discriminate against people of African descent, and for a century afterwards, they were subjected to racial discrimination, violence, etc.  In a country where a significant percentage of the population is black, the struggle for equal rights, and the symbols that defined decades of oppression, are much more stark and polarizing in the US than they are in most European countries. This is why Zwarte Piet is still easy to find in many celebrations in Belgium and the Netherlands, although it has come under increased scrutiny in the Netherlands in recent years as the government and the society become more mindful of these sorts of things.  **TL;DR**: Negative depictions of blackface are more polarizing in the US, as more of its population is black, and suffered through centuries of slavery and oppression, whereas most of the oppression by European countries was colonial, meaning that it didn't happen 'at home'."

I've seen people claim both but I'd really like to know what psychologists who study these kind of behaviors have to say on the issue; I've never found any studies on it.  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/4l6iyf/a_bit_of_a_touch_subject_but_does_drawn/  I'm reposting this because it was asked previously, and upvoted, but apparently didn't get much of an answer.\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " As far as I know, there are no studies directly studying the topic, especially drawings such as those defined \"loli\". I will attempt to provide an overview of what is arguably known and comment on how it relates to the question. It is a long reply, which I will divide in two comments, because I believe such a delicate/contentious topic requires a bit more in-depth considerations.  As a premise, studying pedophilia in itself is difficult, as they have little incentive to identify themselves even to medical doctors and therapists (because of the stigma, the amalgamation of pedophilia as a paraphilia and the criminal behavior that is child sexual abuse, fear of being outed for being a pedophile and of the social consequences, etc.). Therefore, many studies focus on child sexual abusers, which are not always pedophiles and cannot be considered at face value representative of pedophiles who do not act. Citing Seto:  >The **prevalence of pedophilia in the general population is unknown**. Epidemiological surveys with the questions that are needed to identify pedophilia\u2014particularly those having to do with persistence and intensity of sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges, arousal, or behavior involving prepubescent children\u2014have not yet been conducted. **Ever having thoughts of sex with a prepubescent child or even ever having sexual contact with a prepubescent child would not be sufficient to meet the standard diagnostic criteria for pedophilia because persistence and intensity are two key features of these definitions.**  Check the first link for a long discussion on the topic, but pedophiles are not necessarily child sexual offenders and, less obviously, child sexual offenders are not necessarily pedophiles. Citing Finkelhor:  >But **among child abusers] who are [caught], most are not pedophiles. In fact, about half of all victims are post-pubescent, ranging in age from twelve to seventeen, so that most of their offenders would not qualify as pedophiles**. Moreover about **a third of offenders against juveniles are themselves juveniles** (an even larger share of the offenders against young juveniles are juveniles). These young offenders are **also not pedophiles, but include a mixed group of generally delinquent youth and youth who engage in somewhat impulsive, developmentally transitory behavior**. Even **among adults who victimize children under thirteen**, at least **a third or more do not qualify as pedophiles**. The equation of sexual abuse with pedophilia is thus misleading.  Then there is also the question of [hebephilia, in regard to which it is debatable if can be considered a mental illness (i.e. is it a dysfunction?).  Let's step back and ask: is there a relationship between pornography and sexual abuse? This is a highly debated topic. I would suggest the consensus is that increased availability of pornography in recent decades has not contributed to increasing the rates of sexual offences internationally, however the debate is ongoing. Following year of publication:  ---  Kutchinsky studied the availability of pornography compared to the incidence of sex crimes in Denmark, especially child molestation:  >The unexpected  outcome of this  analysis is that  the high availability of hard-core pornography in Denmark was most probably the very direct cause of a  considerable  decrease  in at least one type of serious sex offense, namely, child  molestation. **Between   1965 (the first  year of the availability of hard-core pornographic pictures) and 1969 (the year of the repeal of the Penal Law ban, and of peak production), the  number of cases of this type dropped from 220 to 87**. The implication of our conclusion is that a  large number of such offenses have been avoided since the late 1960s, because potential offenders obtained sufficient  sexual satisfaction through  the use of pornography, most  probably combined with masturbation.  Diamond analyzed the incidence of sex crimes (rape) in Japan, Shanghai and the US associated with the availability of sexually explicit materials (SEM). He focused on \"Japan, a country quite different from those in the West. **In regard to pornography, in Japan the swing from prudish and restrictive to relatively permissive and nonrestrictive was dramatic. Some limited data from Shanghai and new data from the United States follow**\". He was particularly interested in Japan, because:  >Currently , not only are visuals with pubic hair and exposed genitalia present, but **available are cartoon images of hard-core sexual encounters in manga as well as in adult reading materials**. These can be pictures and stories involving bestiality, sadomasochism, necrophilia and incest; **the characters involved may be adults, children or both. Essentially, anything goes.**\"  He concluded that:  >It is certainly clear from the data reviewed, and the new data and analysis presented, that **a massive increase in available pornography in Japan, the United States and elsewhere has been correlated with a dramatic decrease in sexual crimes and most so among youngsters as perpetrators or victims**  On the topic of virtual child pornography, Malamuth and Hupin reviewed the literature on pornography and concluded the following:  >Taken together, **the two lines of independent lines of research** (one **focusing primarily on groups of offenders**, the **other primarily studying non-forensic samples with varying degrees of risk profiles**) complement each other very well by their strengths and limitations. Importantly, the two lines of research **support similar conclusions**: **exposure to nonconsenting pornography** (child or adult) **can \"whet the appetite\" or \"add fuel to the fire\" for individuals with a relatively high risk for offending** (revealed either by a previous conviction for offending or by scoring highly on risk factors for sexual aggression). On the other hand, **individuals with low known risk for sexual offending** (revealed either by lack of previous behavioral offenses or by scoring low on risk factors) **do not show any evidence of increased risk for sexual offending as a result of exposure to such pornography.**  Following their review of literature, Ferguson and Hartley concluded \"that it is time to discard the hypothesis that pornography contributes to increased sexual assault behavior\":  >Considered together, **the available data about pornography consumption and rape rates in the United States seem to rule out a causal relationship, at least with respect to pornography availability causing an increase in the incidence of rape**. One could even argue that the available research and self-reported and official statistics might provide evidence for the reverse effect; the increasing availability of pornography appears to be associated with a decline in rape.Whatever the explanation is, the fact remains that crime in general,and rape specifically, has decreased substantially for the last 20 years.Concurrently, availability of pornography has increased steadily in the last 20 years.  Returning to Diamond and colleagues, they studied the Czech Republic for the following reason:  >**Following  the effects  of  a  new  law  in  the  Czech  Republic  that  allowed pornography to a society previously having forbidden it** allowed us to **monitor the change in sex related crime that followed the change.**  They concluded:  >The most obvious and significant finding is that **since 1989, with the shift from a political system with its total ban on SEM and anything that might be considered pornographic to the present regime  and  the  wide  spread  availability  of  SEM**  in  various media from publication to films, CDs and the Internet, the incidence of reported **sex related crimes has not increased**. Perhaps **most critically, child sex-abuse, despite a brief upswing toward its pre-democracy rate, resumed a decline that had begun, for unknown reasons, in the early 1970s.** The **lesser sex related crimes of peeping and indecent exposure also dropped significantly and appears to have reached a low and steady state**. This is interesting since child sex abuse and so-called \u2018\u2018hands off\u2019 \u2019sex crimes are supposedly the most resistant to change (Marshall,2005).  In their discussion, they argue:  >Issues surrounding child pornography and child sex abuse are probably among the most contentious in the area of sex issues and crime. In this regard **we consider instructive our findings for the Czech Republic that have echoed those found in Denmark** (Kutchinsky, 1973) **and Japan** (Diamond & Uchiyama, 1999)  **that  where  so-called  child-pornography  was  readily available  without  restriction  the  incidence  of  child  sexual abuse was lower than when its availability was restricted** [...]  >We do not approve of the use of real children in the production or distribution of child pornography **but artificially produced materials might serve**."

Think about it. Here's a quick list:   - The mentally ill are ashamed and afraid to come out (with good reason) just like gays.  - They are discriminated against because of their condition by society, even if they are treated or have been cured.  - They are discriminated against by doctors outside of the mental health specialty. - They are imprisoned against their will, without a trial and without resort, in facilities that are still very much medieval in their patient care (even with the introduction of neuroleptics). If the families don't come pick them up, they are left there for years -- or for the rest of their lives -- to rot, even if they have regained functionality.  - They have no chance of defending themselves against the psychiatrists if they are accused of being dangerously mentally ill, an accusation that has been used politically (people have been imprisoned/interned for political reasons, for example, black activists were imprisoned with a fake diagnostic of schizophrenia in the 1970s) and it has been used for personal gain (husbands who want to get rid of wives they've fallen out of love, for one example).  - They are constantly negatively stereotyped on films -- schizophrenics are wrongly characterized as suffering from split personality (not what schizophrenia is) and as violent (schizophrenia doesn't make them more aggressive); psychopaths are always shown as highly intelligent, with high attention spans, conniving and, more markedly, as murderers (psychopaths aren't necessarily murderers, and this stereotype has been used as a justification to lock them up for life in institutions); of autists, only the savants are portrayed; psychosis, which isn't a mental illness, is portrayed as one; and so on. - They have been, in the recent past, selected to be murdered and forcefully sterilized. - Once they are marked as mentally ill and forced through the gears of the mental health system, it's very, very difficult to get back into society, even if they are fully recovered. The stigma itself can cause symptoms.   The list goes on and on, yet no one with influence has taken their cause. They're barely acknowledged as a civil rights cause, except in governmental victim statistics."

This point is arguable, but a depressed person is not really in the right state of mind to make a rational decision about whether or not to end his/her life. As is the case with many who attempt suicide but fail, they want to commit suicide while they are in that depressed state but when they recover, they regret what they have done and want to live.

Simply because there are enough descendants of those slaves to matter politically, along with historical details that matter.  Canada's black population is 2.5% of the total population. Further, of that 2.5% only a minority are the descendants of slaves, most are refugees from Africa arriving in the 1970s and 1980s. And, like those refugees, those Canadians who were descended from slaves were rescued from slavery or were Loyalists already free. So, obviously, their relation to that history is very different from America.  The UK has 3% of its population identified as 'Black/African/Caribbean/Black British'. Of those, many are citizens of former imperial colonies, and not descendants of slaves. Although a significant amount are the descendants of enslaved Africans.  America by contrast has 13.3% of its population being of African descent, and of those, the vast majority being descendants of slaves. However, the picture is complex, as some of these descendants of slaves intermarried or intermingled with Americans of European origin, aboriginal Americans, as well as later economic immigrants from the Caribbean (who may also be descended from slaves), and latin America. What's more, the descendants of slaves in America tend to be highly concentrated geographically, creating regions of the country where the representative percentage of the population is even higher.  Using recent DNA studies, the details of this intermingling have become clear (via The Root):  >According to Ancestry.com, the average African American is 65 percent sub-Saharan African, 29 percent European and 2 percent Native American.  >According to 23andme.com, the average African American is 75 percent sub-Saharan African, 22 percent European and only 0.6 percent Native American.   >According to Family Tree DNA.com, the average African American is 72.95 percent sub-Saharan African, 22.83 percent European and 1.7 percent Native American.  >According to National Geographic's Genographic Project, the average African American is 80 percent sub-Saharan African, 19 percent European and 1 percent Native American.  In summary, the simplest answer to your question is that there are enough people in this country who have a personal, historical, and socio-biological stake in slave descendancy, that it matters to everyone. A more complex answer is that geography, genetic admixture, and socio-polltical forces amplify the importance of this diverse, somewhat ambiguous group's representation, making it an essential constituency in the democracy and culture milieu. An example of this amplification is found in this Gallup poll which shows a gross exaggeration in the minds of Americans as to the size of the African American population.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Canadians  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_British#Population  https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045216  https://www.theroot.com/exactly-how-black-is-black-america-1790895185"

When describing relationships involving a man and a woman, the point of reference is commonly the latter (i.e., hypergamy involves a woman marrying a higher status man).   Broadly speaking, human partnerships tend to be homogamous (i.e., to involve people with similar sociodemographic characteristics) and endogamous (i.e., to involve people pertaining to the same sociocultural group, e.g., the same ethnic group) (Rosenfeld, 2005). However, when researchers observe a difference within heterosexual heterogamous relationships, the man tends to have a higher status than the woman (on the basis of education, wealth, etc.). Before continuing, it is important to keep in mind that people do not get together in an entirely random fashion. Besides individual preferences, there are also structural and normative constraints to take into account. To quote Er\u00e1t (2021):  >As noted in the introduction, **partner selection is not an entirely random process, as persons aim to choose others based on certain preferences. From the numerous possible criteria, socioeconomic attributes** (such as income, wealth, occupation, prestige, and education) **are often emphasized because they influence the status and well-being of the individual and the couple due to the pooling of resources in a relationship** (Parsons 1942, 1955a, 1955b; South 1991; Kalmijn 1998; Bukodi 2002). This effect on status has also been noted by social stratification researchers, who identify partnerships (primarily marriages) as potential avenues of upward social mobility, recognizing that a \u2018good match\u2019 has the opportunity to substantially improve someone\u2019s status position (Sorokin 1972; Hout 1982).  But also:  >As conceptualized by Winch decades ago, partner selection is a phenomenon where an individual chooses a preferred partner from a \u201crestricted segment of the population\u201d, which he named the \u201cfield of eligibles\u201d (1958: 14; Kerckhoff 1964: 290\u2012291). Similarly, Huckfeldt posited that interaction is shaped by the social composition of the \u201crelevant environment\u201d (1983: 653). Regarding sexual partners, Laumann et al. speak in similar terms about sexual networks and their social structure (1994). **In short, partner selection is limited by the structural conditions of the so-called relationship market, which operates by the logic of numbers as the term encompasses the number and quality of potential mates whom the individual has a chance to meet** (Kalmijn 1994, 1998; Bukodi 2002; Rosenfeld 2002).  And to quote Kalmijn (1998):  >There are many theories about partner choice, and such notions provide important clues about the causes of intermarriage and homogamy. **In general, marriage patterns arise from three social forces: the preferences of individuals for resources in a partner, the influence of the social group, and the constraints of the marriage market.**  Therefore, human relationships are not just a simple function of what people \"value\" in potential partners.  ---  Relatedly, preferences and patterns can be different across different kinds of unions (e.g., marriage vs cohabitation [Blackwell & Lichter, 2000; Hamplova, 2009; Schoen & Weinick, 1993]) and for different populations around the globe. Furthermore, these patterns are not static. In fact, in recent years there have been notable shifts in the USA and in Europe. According to Esteve et al. (2016):  >Our data provided a rich source for visualizing the universal shift from male to female dominance in educational systems and its concomitant impact on educational assortative mating. **The evidence suggests that young people adapt to new demographic realities by increasingly forming unions in which wives have the educational advantage, leading to substantial declines in the historical hypergamic pattern.** Across a range of different contexts (e.g. United States, France, India, South Korea, Kenya), the norms governing marriage markets have proven flexible enough to accommodate the increasing numbers of highly educated women and, **as consequence, the numbers of women marrying down has increased steadily.**  And according to Van Bavel et al. (2018):  >Nevertheless, the pattern in the United States and Europe has been toward substantial increases in the proportions of couples in which wives have more education than their husbands: **While educational homogamy remains dominant, couples in which wives have more education than their husbands have become more prevalent than those in which husbands have more education than their wives in recent decades, not just in the West but also in non-Western countries that have experienced RGE** [reversal of the gender gap in education]. In turn, **the proportion of households where wives earn more than husbands has also increased.**  That said, it is possible that *educational* hypogamy does not equal *status* hypogamy. For illustration, see Chudnovskaya and Kashyap's (2020) study of childbearing unions in Sweden, who argue:  >An alternative possibility is that female educational hypogamy does not imply the re-ordering of the gendered power order in unions, but continued hypergamy across other status dimensions. **Women may \u2018partner down\u2019 in education but choose men who compensate with other forms of status, e.g. class background, income, or occupational prestige** (Blossfeld and Timm, 2003).  They conclude:  >The rise of educational hypogamy has been heralded as a part of the broader set of changes described as the gender revolution. Our closer examination of status inequalities within hypogamous couples lends support to a stalled gender revolution perspective. **We find that the highly educated women with the highest status pair with highly educated men** (who tend to have even higher status than the women). **Meanwhile, women who partner down tend to be relatively disadvantaged.** The trends we observe could be driven either by preferences (towards egalitarianism or women\u2019s status hypergamy) or by constraints (social norms or partner market structures).  ---  Blackwell, D.

                "content": " Reposting because I forgot the links the first time:    I do not have studies to answer your question directly, but I wanted to provide some context for whatever anyone else will find. There is a flaw in your question: you assume that same-sex marriage was needed for wide-spread adoption by same-sex couples. That isn't the case. Adoption by same-sex couples was not uncommon even in the 1990s and earlier; they just often weren't \"out\" about it during the process (which will likely affect any statistical data from those periods).    Adoption by same-sex couples was permitted even when marriage was not, although it definitely varied by state. There are a few interesting law review articles on adoption by same-sex couples prior to legalization of same-sex marriage (some of these are paywalled via HeinOnline):   * Vanessa A. Lavely, The Path to Recognition of Same-Sex Marriage: Reconciling the Inconsistencies between Marriage and Adoption Cases, 55 UCLA L. Rev. 247 \\(2007-2008\\)   * Timothy E. Lin, Social Norms and Judicial Decisionmaking: Examining the Role of Narratives in Same-Sex Adoption Cases, 99 Colum. L. Rev. 739 \\(1999\\)   * Same-Sex Adoption: An Alternative Approach to Gay Marriage in New York, 62 Brook. L. Rev. 399 (1996)   * Annette R. Appell, The Endurance of Biological Connection: Heteronormativity, Same-Sex Parenting and the Lessons of Adoption, 22 BYU J. Pub. L. 289 \\(2007-2008\\)    I worked at an adoption law firm for several years leading up to the Obergefell v. Hodges decision in 2015. Although I do not have an article to cite on it, I know that several states imposed more severe restrictions to curb same-sex adoption as the political fights over same-sex marriage increased. The restrictions ranged from limiting birth certificates to list one male and one female maximum, to disqualifying same-sex couples from participating in foster-to-adopt programs, to outright prohibiting adoption by same-sex couples. The usual loophole we were able to exploit was that one person could still adopt, and then the couple would move to another state where it was legal to do a second-parent adoption. We came up with a lot of creative ways to make it work, but it was a huge hassle.  I expect that during the years of about 2005 to 2015, any statistical data on the issue will show rapid and dramatic fluctuations for numbers of same-sex adoptions. On one hand, it likely increased in the states that legalized same-sex marriage and had growing social acceptance of adoption by same sex couples; but in other states, it became more difficult to due increasing restrictions.    Post 2015, I expect that there would be growth in number of adoptions generally, but it still took a lot of time for those adoption restrictions to be lifted. We still had clients that could not adopt from certain states. Legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide did not have an immediate or direct effect on the hurdles for adoption.    You may also want to compare statistics of whether same-sex couples are more or less likely to participate in foster-adopt programs than heterosexual couples or single individuals. High-income couples typically do not adopt foster children, and in my experience, most (not all) of our same-sex couple clients were very high earners. High-income couples often adopt through private agencies (which involve direct placement by the birth parents, often at or shortly after birth), either domestically or internationally. That trend very well could have changed as adoption restrictions were lifted and social acceptance changed; as same-sex couples and marriage become more accepted, then lower-income and middle-income couples are better able to navigate and succeed in the foster-adopt systems."

Do political psychologists have an analogous personality category for people who are left of center? I only hear about research on \"Right-Wing Authoritarianism\". This Vox article, called \"The Rise of American Authoritarianism\", is about the psychology of Trump voters in particular.  The article doesn't mention it specifically, but I know that this \"authoritarianism\" has since the 1980's often been called \"Right-Wing Authoritarianism\".  The article does mention that the initial idea comes from a specific set of studies conducted during the 1940's that lead to Adorno's *The Authoritarian Personality* (which is mentioned in the article) and were concerned with trying to psychologically explain the rise of Fascism.  So it's a study of the Right all the way down.  Now, I'm a sociologist not a psychologist, but the scale has always struck me as odd because it seems to assume that authoritarian was the deviation from the norm.  Yesterday, I voted in the Massachusetts Democratic primary primary, and now I wonder if there's an analogous psychological \"deviation from the norm\" in the other direction that is useful in explaining left-wing politics.  Is there a similar psychological profile that explains, say, a Bernie Sanders, or an Obama in 2008 candidate?  A hope and change meritocracy and egalitarianism candidate?  Or perhaps just a specific \"anti-authoritarianism\" personality that could be find both in left wing and libertarian movements?  The recent studies mentioned in the article think that there can be some \"activation\" of the authoritarian type/authoritarian personality only has an increased influence on political preference under certain conditions, namely during periods of increased social change and increased threats to security.  From the Vox article:  >But both schools of thought agree on the basic causality of authoritarianism. People do not support extreme policies and strongman leaders just out of an affirmative desire for authoritarianism, but rather as a response to experiencing certain kinds of threats [i.e. social change and physical threats].  If a left-wing analogue exists and has been studied, does evidence suggest political preferences for these personality types can be \"activated\"?  If so, under what circumstances?  As a side note, there seems to be far more research into right wing political psychology than left wing political psychology, or at least, more of it that has filtered into social science more broadly--it's an interesting contrast with, say, the social movement literature which is extensively focused on left wing social movements.  I know there was an abortive attempt to look at support for \"left-wing authoritarianism\" (Stalinism and all that) that happened around when \"right-wing authoritarianism\" was coined, but that that line of research mostly fizzled.  If anyone can explain that difference, I'd also be curious. (with citations, of course, not gut feelings or posts from Heterodox Academy, showing the dominance of liberals in the social sciences--since liberals are equally dominant in both fields, that doesn't solve the puzzle of why political psychology is studying the right more closely and political sociology is studying the left more closely).

Since this is a political thread, low quality posts and soap boxing (including loaded questions) will be deleted very quickly so that things don't get out of control.

                "content": " I'm going to be drawing most of my information from Thomas Berger's \"War, Guilt and Politics\" as well as my own research looking at international relations between Japan, China and South Korea. This information will be incomplete as I'm at work and don't have the book on hand.  There are three strands of arguments that help explain the various levels of penitence, the exact names of which escape me but there's an instrumental argument (ie, politicians manipulated their stance on war to serve national or self interest), cultural (there is a distinct difference between European and East Asian ways of recalling the past) and another...which I can't remember too well. (Sorry.)  For the sake of messing with order lets start with cultural. I'm not a huge fan of this argument but it does make sense. Austrian and German culture appreciate the concept of guilt. Guilt, it is argued, is a something has trickled down through society via the medium of Christianity. Being sorry for something is often important on the way to atonement. Germany was able to show greater penitence for its past because of the Western acceptance of this guilt cultural phenomena. (China and South Korea do make plenty of arguments about Japanese lack of penitence, so there is a slight hole in that line of thinking. )  Japanese culture however values shame. So essentially you get this dichotomy of shame vs guilt. Shame culture doesn't so much require a large public apology to show atonement. Quite often and offering of compensation is often enough to show penitence. Japan did offer a struggling South Korea a substantial sum of money in the 1960 normalisation process that prescribed that South Korean citizens were no longer able to claim compensation. The Korea Republic took it, so in the minds of some Japanese politicians, this issue had been dealt with.   As for the instrumentalist argument, this is something that I used relatively extensively in my Masters thesis. For the record, I don't recall the chapters from Berger on Germany too well as it wasn't something I was overly familiar with when I started reading the book, but there were essentially external and internal forces within Europe that forced German administrators to be more penitent. I'm not sure if this is exactly from the book, but a more penitent Germany would have been more beneficial for Western Europe looking at trying to withstand Soviet influence. A powerhouse like Germany was well needed to defend against the USSR for the rest of Europe but also the USA. You couldn't have a border nation with the Eastern bloc caught in the middle of Western Europeans that hate you and Eastern bloc nations that are looking to jump you. Anyway, there was a political reason to do it.  Asia was very different for Japan. Whilst Japanese atrocities were certainly no better than what the Nazis did in Germany, the political realities were a little different. Immediately following the second world war, Japan was stripped of arms and became an occupied nation, this was only to be followed up very soon after by the war on the Korean peninsula. Suddenly Japan was needed as a forward base for American operations. Japanese police forces were rearmed and military-like entities started to emerge again. US interests in Asia and the interest in repelling the communist threat overrode the need to continue the pacification process. Japan basically went from enemy to ally in the space of 10 years. Japan also experienced exponential growth in the following decades leaving much of East Asia behind, again.  Looking China and South Korea at the time, in the 50's and 60's both were more preoccupied with rebuilding their countries than standing up and asking for apologies from the Japanese. Mao was busy with his cultural revolutions and spreading the good word through China and as I mentioned above, the RoK took a lot of money from Japan to improve it's economic growth in return for basically forgetting about what happened in World War II. Japan essentially was not bombarded in the same way that Germany was following World War II and was also somewhat vindicated when the US immediately turned to them for help in the Korean war as well as significantly investing in the Japanese economy to create a US-allied economic giant to form a pillar against the possible threats in the Asia-Pacific.   To keep going, it is so much easier to pin the war atrocities from Germany on the Nazis. When looking at the history of world war II, it was the Nazis that committed the atrocities, not 'Germany' as such. Everyone can finger Hitler when looking at the worst crimes but you can't really pin it on anyone in Japan, not in the same way.  Much debate has centred around the role of the Emperor in the way Japan conducted its foreign policy (See Hirohito and the making of Japan by Herbert Bix). The US occupying forces essentially saw it as a bad idea to implicate the Emperor in Japan's war atrocities as there was a great cult of personality surrounding him and of course much argument as to how much direct involvement he actually had. Since the Meiji restoration, the Emperor as god had been kind of central to how Japanese people imagined their country. The Emperor was the head of the Shinto religion and was able to exert influence as such. However, much of this influence could be symbolic. That is another discussion that I can come back to at another point.  What I am saying is that there was no obvious singular instigator to point to.  I would also like to add that Japanese people are generally quite pacifist these days, they don't like the idea of war, but that is not because of what they inflicted on the world but rather what war brought upon them. Hiroshima and Nagasaki are two modern disasters that both fell upon the Japanese killing hundreds of thousands of people. Add into the mix the air-raids and fire bombings and Japan was utterly devastated. This has made people fearful of war but not apologetic to the rest of world. I think, just anecdotally, that Japanese people are more insular than many other peoples I have interacted with.   As for the current situation, the Japanese government has issued no less than 49 official apologies for the war since the 1950's.  The reason there seems to be such furor about Japan's lack of atonement for the past to me seems like a lot of nationalistic chest beating on the other side of the fence the South Korean government is notorious for drumming up anti-Japanese sentiment to prop up it's approval ratings and Chinese anger also has more instrumental roots. By trying to deligitimise Japan's past, it can add further validity to it's own land claims and the like such as the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. Not only this, but it can also distract the public from internal issues as with South Korea.   I hope that helps your understanding a little bit, but I really do recommend reading Thomas Berger's book for a better understanding."

Polling from the 2016 Election showed that people, especially Trump voters, were more likely to be honest---either by answering the question at all or by giving a more intensely pro-Trump stance---on automated polls than when a human operator was on the line. Five thirty-eight had an extensive piece on polling failures in this post-election post mortem: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-missed-trump-we-asked-pollsters-why/  I'm not sure what /u/agamenticus meant specifically with respect to the sampling methodologies, but here's a more detailed answer: On top of possibly having different strategies for calling landline and mobile numbers (user bases are very different), Rasmussen and Pew feed many of the same factors, such as age, education, gender, and race into proprietary weighting algorithms to ensure that all demographic backgrounds are adequately represented. However, while the factors may look the same, the criteria for weighting those factors *may* look wildly different.  Last, and I haven't had time look into it, but Rasmussen as late as 2012 **did not** provide a Spanish-language interview option like Pew does. Voters with low-English ability are much more likely to hang up or refuse to answer if they feel like they cannot adequately understand/answer the questions. Research (Lee and Perez 2014 in political science, Lechuga and Wiebe 2009 in healthcare research, etc) has shown that answers and attitudes can change depending on the language in which the polling is conducted, though we don't know conclusively if this connection is causal or magnitude of its effect. However, I think Pew uncritically merges the answer sets together, so that could be a confounding factor that merits further analysis.  Edited for clarity because I can't dependent clause correctly.  Edit 2: Targeted adult respondent populations also differ, as /u/thehollowman84 pointed out. Pew polls adults over 18, while Rasmussen polls likely voters. Polling from previous elections, especially Obama-Romney 2012, showed that determining who is a \"likely\" voter is an art unto itself and can determine the shape of the data collected for analysis."

Things prized in suburbs are anathema to property values in cities. In most large cities the location of highways near poor neighborhoods is because planners dumped interstates into areas with the least political clout or economic power--most commonly heavily minority areas. Putting an interstate here was the most \"economical\" from the State's perspective of land acquisition and dovetailed nicely with vogue of slum clearance. Once built highways tended to further reinforce the existing segregation and economic depression in those communities.  The end result is that today those communities are often even more devastated than they were prior to having their physical neighborhoods ripped apart so suburban commuters could get downtown faster in their cozy, private, cars.   If you want to read about the machinations of how this happened Caro's book on Robert Moses, The Power Broker, is a good place to start."

                "content": " There are a couple of different ways of thinking about this.  The classic one goes back to Max Weber, who suggested that your status was based on a combination of factors - your wealth, which is obvious, your 'prestige', which is more or less like the honor or esteem people have for you (as an adjunct professor, I make less money than the guy who picks up my trash, but because I'm a college professor, that career is seen as more prestigious and respectable than garbage collector), and power, your ability to get things done.  There are people who are very connected and can pull strings to get things done, even though they may be relatively poor or lack respect (a small-town preacher, for instance).  Your social status is a combination of those factors.  People who come from more prestigious backgrounds expect their kids to follow in those backgrounds, and they expect the treatment commensurate with that status level.  Another way of thinking about it is cultural capital, which is the idea that there are certain social survival skills that are valued in society.  These include things like cultural knowledge (both in the sense of etiquette and facts), language (proper accent, diction and grammar), and behavioral patterns, all of which are transmitted from parents to children (as well as from other important people and institutions, like a finishing school).  The ability to talk one-on-one with your doctor or a police officer or some other authority figure is a learned skill, and it's a form of cultural capital.    Basically, the place where you grew up is a box, and your opportunities are largely (but not entirely) defined by the contents of that box.  If you grew up in a neighborhood full of white collar middle management people with college degrees, it's going to be expected that you go to college and get at least a four year degree so you can work a white collar job.  Becoming a hedge fund manager seems unlikely, as does becoming a long-haul trucker.  If you grew up in a farming community where most people work in agriculture or skilled trades to support the agricultural community (auto repair, electrical, etc.) then there isn't that assumption about college - maybe you go to the local vo-tech and learn to fix tractors or style hair, but a Ph.D isn't really something that's considered.  On the other-other hand, if you grew up a Vanderbilt or a Rockefeller or similar, in a world where everyone in your family attended prestigious private schools, and you regularly take trips to your vacation homes, and your only encounters with skilled laborers is when they come to your house to fix something, getting a vo-tech degree in auto repair is beyond the pale.  You go get an advanced degree and you maintain the family fortune.  All of these things come back to cultural capital - at the end of the day, objectively speaking, garbage collector or diesel mechanic are no better or worse vocations than college professor or independently wealthy heir (in fact, you could argue that they are actually more important to a functioning society), but the cultural values and expectations associated with these upper-class positions are held in much higher esteem than those of the working class.  Knowing how to network and how to negotiate the world of powerful people is a skill that is learned by being around powerful people.  this reproduces the existing class system because no matter how rich a Bill Gates or a Jay-Z gets, those guys are still \"new money\" to the Pierponts and such, and they lack the necessary cultural capital to really fit in amongst the ultra-elite of society.  Does that make sense?  I feel like I rambled a little bit."

Whether its fiscal policy, social policy, gun laws, security, etc.  Why are 'slippery slope' arguments typically dismissed and looked down upon?  A few examples:  * Following 9/11, the increases in authority by the US police and security organizations will inevitably have a negative impact on personal liberties and freedom.  * By banning firearms magazines greater than 20 rounds, what is to stop further restrictions down to 15 rounds?  Or 10?  * When you start giving people free housing, free money, free food, then what is stopping you from giving them free education, healthcare, etc.?  It appears to me that one should acknowledge the potential long-term path certain policy decisions may end up taking.  Other concepts, like the Overton Window come into play, where one can push the limit of public policies until they become acceptable, are perfect examples of 'moving goalposts' in terms of policy reach and scope.  An example for this is: Today, the TSA is quite a common sight at airports and publicly acceptable (much to the chagrin of Reddit), which allows for the expansion of TSA presence into train and bus stations, further increasing the reach and scope of the organization.  Once this becomes commonplace, then the TSA will expand further and further.  As a freedom-loving human being, I think the utmost caution needs to be taken with any broad stroke public policy which deals with our healthcare, education, safety, and security.

The daughter will probably eventually take on the caregiver role. The mother encouraging care giving imitation may be a social phenomenon rising out of the biological expectations of the mother.

However, it is a lot of literature to cover, as in there is a lot of pertinent theories and models. And the effectiveness of different approaches and considerations depend on *several* factors, such that saying that one model or approach is generally effective could be said to be disingenuous.   I will share some models that can be applied to understand how and when attitude can be changed, just to give an overview of the research and show how rich the literature is and how complex persuasion and social influence is as a topic:  * Elaboration likelihood model  * Theory of reasoned action   * Theory of planned behavior  * Social norms approach  * Nudge theory  * Fear appeal  You can go to this older thread for a reply I gave going a bit deeper into the specific case of how **minorities** can influence people (and I also touch upon the matter of different *kinds of influence*). You can also read this other reply on the same topic but focused on the question of violence.  Cialdini is a famous social psychologist specialized in persuasion, and according to his research there are six shortcuts that inform human behavior and decision-making: **reciprocity** (people tend to feel obliged to return favors), **scarcity** (people tend to like what is limited in availability or difficult to get), **authority** (people tend to defer to power, status, expertise), **consistency** (people tend to want to behave consistently, i.e. foot-in-the-door), **liking** (people are likelier to be persuaded by whom they find attractive), **consensus** (people tend to want to follow the majority, as it provides 'information').   Social psychological research in general shows that it is more complicated than just applying these six principles, as these rely on **heuristics** (see the **elaboration likelihood model**). For example, people do not always defer to experts (see climate change and vaccinations). There are many other factors to consider, such as the person's **motivation** and **cognitive resources** (e.g. willing and being able to dedicate time to think about something).  Nudge theory](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/MINDSPACE.pdf ) could be considered complimentary to Cialdini's principles and seems to be popular lately, based on the idea of making things **easy** (reduce the effort to make an action, to understand a message, etc.), making it **attractive** (e.g. using rewards and sanctions to incentivize and de-incentive behavior), making it **social** (e.g. using social norms and encouraging people to make commitments to others) and making it **timely** (e.g. considering the importance of when an offer is made and taking into account that people like immediate results).  To conclude, [Macron's victory could be considered an example of how doing research and learning from other campaigns, having a good strategy (deciding the message), carrying it (the strategy and the message) out, can be effective.  Edit: This reply I gave on the impact of advertisement on attitude change might also be an interesting read, as I detail how **different messages work better with different kinds of people**, and how attempts at **persuasion can backfire**."

It managed to recover modestly in the mid-20s, after several political and economic catastrophies (hyperinflation, political assassinations, attempted coups and revolutions, Ruhr area occupation by France) hitting their peak in 1923, but in 1929 the financial crisis hit and sent the German economy into a tailspin again. After the democratic parties failed to keep a broad government coalition together, a quick succession of President-appointed cabinets failed to solve much until Hitler was appointed and quickly established a dictatorship. Nazi Germany financed its rearmament and infrastructure spending via massive debts in the lead-up to WWII that was to be repaid with war spoils. After WWII, Germany was totally bombed out and lay in physical and economic ruins, but was full of skilled workers that lived in higher concentration than pre-war due to the smaller borders and forced resettlement. In light of the looming US-Soviet conflict, the US decided to support the rebuilding of Europe via the Marshall plan, loans to European countries in severe economic trouble after the war. The investment (but more importantly, political and economic integration with the West and the US which was largely unharmed by the war and economically in a good position), the skilled labor, and the massive need for rebuilding all created the post-war \"economic miracle\", with cheap, high-quality German manufacturing export to the Western bloc becoming a powerful economic motor that lead Germany to renewed economic power. The idea of \"social market economy\" was also coined around this time. That's basically how Germany got to be prosperous again after WW2.   Reading on that: Ian Kershaw, Weimar. Why did German Democracy Fail?  Rebuilding Germany.   German Economic Miracle  (Sorry for not being very in-depth with sources, but they should cover some of your questions I hope. Ask /r/AskHistorians for properly up to date historiography!)  Obviously, a lot happened since then. Mining and heavy industry declined and the service sector grew, like in other first world economies. Notably for today, 1998 saw the third way-leaning Social Democrats (SPD) come to power, who in the 2000s introduced some reforms that were heavily criticized as being neoliberal, at a time when German unemployment was at high levels. Since then, I've seen people argue that the flexibility of the German labor market has kept unemployment low, while German industry has kept its position as being one of the most export-oriented. I'm not an economist though, so this would probably be better off answered by someone else.  **Edit:** Also, do remember that Germany is pretty big. It currently (post-reunification) has 82 million inhabitants, which is more than the UK or France."

The standard accepted theory of personality today is the Big 5 (give or take one or two, depending on what people want to include and their theoretical perspective).  This wasn't just pop psychology, as serious psychologists used to subscribe to type-based theories of personality, these theories have just been discredited and replaced by trait-based theories. Wikipedia has a nice little discussion of this distinction. Other sources include work by McRae & Costa that unified the MBTI framework with the Big 5, basically Lewis Goldberg's entire catalog, and other current researchers that have addressed issues with personality such as Sam Gosling. Geoffrey Miller also has a nice intro to the topic at the beginning of his book Spent.  On the other hand, I work with applied personality research, and I have found it odd how compelling and intuitive non-psychologists find type-based theories. I have often wondered what it is about the way our minds think about people that makes us so susceptible to type-based thinking of personalities. I suspect this has something to do with natural intuitions that we all have about people being defined by the roles they play in a society or group, which do tend to be much more type-based (e.g., moms vs dads, bosses vs. subordinates, carpenters vs. lawyers, etc etc.). I think it is an interesting question what makes type-based theories of people so intuitively appealing, given that we are so good at reading people intuitively and these are not well supported by current evidence."

There are some Pew Research Center surveys that show that self-reported Republicans tend to evaluate police more warmly than self-reported Democrats, and that the former tend to have more confidence in police than the latter. According to the same report, the latter are more likely to see police as enforcers rather than protectors. There does seem to be differences along party-lines, although these are not results from studies and therefore should be interpreted with due diligence.  Determining attitudes towards police is more complex than just measuring political attitudes. For example, according to Skogan:  >In brief, the **major determinants of citizen satisfaction with police encounters can be found in the things that police did at the scene**. These included **being polite, helpful, fair, attentive to what they had to say, and willing to explain what was going on**. On the surface, **social factors, such as race, age, and linguistic capabilities, seemed to be linked to views of the police**, a familiar story in American cities. However, **the link was there mostly because these personal factors were related to how the police treated those they stopped or served insome fashion**. Differences in treatment provided most of the link between those important social cleavages and views of the police.  You also have to take into account things such as procedural justice and how it affects police legitimacy. For example, Gau and colleagues argue that how police behaves can have an important impact:  >This study's implications for police policy center on the finding that **people's perceptions of procedural justice significantly impact their perceptions of legitimacy, even controlling for macro-level social and economic disadvantage.** This is an important finding from a policy standpoint because prior studies have found that severe area-level distress can hinder police agencies\u2019 ability to enlist citizens\u2019 help in crime-control efforts (Reisig & Parks, 2004) and can exacerbate the widespread, damaging impact of police misconduct (Kane, 2005). The present study suggests that **procedural justice can be as effective in maligned areas as in more advantaged ones.**  For example, Skogan's research on community policing (specifically the CAPS) shows how a policing model that brings police and community together can improve the former's image, although disparities can remain:  >**One goal of CAPS is to increase confidence in the fairness and effectiveness of the police**. Our surveys find that **opinions of the police improved steadily between 1993 and 1999, before leveling off at a new high in the 2000s**. At the same time, it is also apparent that the **gulf between the races in Chicago has not diminished at all**. Partly this is good news, for it signals that **improvement in the image of the police has been a general one, and not confined to one group**. On every measure, changes in opinion have been apparent among whites, African-Americans and Latinos alike, but the 15-20 percentage point gap between the views of whites and those of other racial groups scarcely closed over 11 years. **Chicagoans are happier about their police than they were a decade ago, but they are just as polarized in their views.**  In sum, I would expect for there to be statistical differences in attitudes towards police between different US states depending on their political configuration, but it is not a given that specific 'blue' states have worse or much worse attitudes. Well, at least in regards to their own local police, considering the Pew Research Center notes that:  >Overall, **U.S. adults give higher ratings to police in their community than they do to police nationwide**, and the **partisan gap in views of local police is narrower.**"

What this meant in practice was that they had the right to advance IOUs for a portion of the money the king now owed them to any inhabitant of the kingdom willing to borrow from them, or willing to deposit their own money in the bank--in effect, to circulate or \"monetize\" the newly created royal debt. This was a great deal for the bankers (they got to charge the kind 8 percent annual interest for the original loan and simultaneously charge interest on the same money to the clients who borrowed it), but it only worked as long as the original loan remained outstanding. To this day, this loan has never been paid back. It cannot be. If it ever were, the entire monetary system of Great Britain would cease to exist.\" p 49   I understand the economics behind what happened but I can't grasp how this loan could still be the entire basis for the financial system today. Also, is there a reason that the 1.2 million pounds was given as a loan to the government and then the government debt was distributed from the \"central bank\" rather than the government just having the bankers loan out the 1.2 million pounds to the people directly? Is it so that the 8% interest on the loan would expand the 'size' of the economy? Anyone who can explain the situation in detail would be owed a large debt!!!!\n\nAssistant:"

I believe that what the author means (though I have not read this specific book) is that from this beginning today's monetary system has arisen. He is using a little bit of hyperbole to emphasize the importance of this event.  > is there a reason that the 1.2 million pounds was given as a loan to the government and then the government debt was distributed from the \"central bank\" rather than the government just having the bankers loan out the 1.2 million pounds to the people directly?  The government did not charter the Bank of England in order to ease credit in the economy. They chartered it to give their lenders an incentive to lend to the government. Remember that governments then did not have a good credit rating (they never paid the loan back!) so providing a monopoly on banking (which cost the government nothing) was the incentive given in turn for offering the loan.  A convenient side effect of chartering the bank, and remember that banks were basically entirely experimental at that time, was the introduction of paper money and the development of the monetary system.  Think of it like this -  The government traded a monopoly on banking to whomever would charter a bank with 1.2 million pounds (this is equity, a liability) and then lend 1.2 million pounds to them (this is their only asset). Initially (ie on day one) it wasn't really a bank - it was a 100% equity backed investment vehicle that owned government debt. It evolved into a bank because they were able to take money on deposit (another liability) to lever their equity contribution and then lend to private businesses and the government.  There were other 'banks' at the same time that were unauthorized to bank working under other corporate shells (in a time when there were very few corporations legally chartered). One such company is the Hollow  Sword Blade Company. I would start my own bank and call it the Hollow Blade Sword Company but unfortunately the initials are HSBC which are the same as the initials of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC).  If you read the wikipedia article about the Hollow Blade Sword Company you will see that the 'cost' of getting the company chartered was... making a loan to the government! They had quite a racket going whereby any company seeking to be chartered needed to make a loan to the government (which would be equity financed) and then would be able to pursue their own business. The incentive for the equity holders was to raise debt to lever their equity and then find lending opportunities with a higher return than lending to the government. The HSBC bought farms in Ireland, for instance, using publicly raised funds (the structure was perhaps something along the lines of preferred equity?).  Please let me know if that is not clear enough."

He is, essentially, the man who revived the anti-vax movement in the United States and is the person to blame for the \"vaccines cause autism\" conspiracy you'll hear thrown around in many circles.   This article by Brian Deer for the British Medical Journal goes into more detail, but essentially -- Wakefield was a physician who forged results in several studies for financial gain. He first \"found\" a link between the MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine and Crohn's disease and claimed that people shouldn't get the combined vaccine. Coincidentally, months earlier he had patented a new measles-only vaccine.  He then published a highly controversial and, unfortunately, influential paper in 1998 that claimed the MMR vaccine was linked to autism. This is where your Jenny McCarthy's et al get this information. It has since been found that not only did Wakefield forge data in the study to make it seem like the MMR vaccine led to autism in children, but the entire time he was conducting the study at the behest of a lawyer who was attempting to sue vaccine manufacturers and was looking for a scientific standing to do so. Over two years, Wakefield made almost \u00a3500,000 to conduct this research.  So, to answer your question, while I cannot say whether or not Wakefield truly believed in his heart of heart's that what he was doing was right, what *is* clear is there is plenty of money to be made in deceiving the public and preying on the fears of grieving or scared parents."

He doesn't believe institutional racism exists, only that racism exists within the populace at large. His belief is how our various laws and industry regulations are written apply fairly to all, the true problem is that the people within these system act on their own racist beliefs when acting within the system, therefore institutional racism does not truly exist. One example he uses is with hiring practices. It is explicitly illegal to discriminate based on skin colour during the hiring process, so when a White person is hired over an African American person based on the colour of their skin it isn't because of institutional racism, its because the person in charge of hiring was acting out on their own racism. He applies this logic to the criminal justice system too: that our laws do not discriminate against African Americans explicitly, and that the cause of higher rates of incarceration amongst them isn't because the system is broken, but because the people who run the system are.  I've tried using the argument \"the institution doesn't exist without the people who run it\" but that doesn't do it for him.

                "content": " I would probably point out a more modern, easy problem to hash out: The drug wars as they pertain to crack cocaine versus pure cocaine.  So the laws around the war on drugs were created with a bit of an odd imbalance, which can very much be used to enact racist outcomes via the power of government institutions. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act in 1986 created minimum federal guidelines for cocaine-related drug crimes. However, they did so in such a way that directly enabled unequal sentencing, by creating a harsher penalty for crack cocaine (which is just a derivative of cocaine cut with a filler agent. ) versus pure powder form of cocaine. 5 grams of crack cocaine would get someone the same sentence as someone with 500 grams of pure cocaine.  In other words, you could buy the 500 grams of pure cocaine and turn it into 1000 grams of crack cocaine. If the person got caught with just the 500 grams, it carried a 5 year minimum Federal sentence. The 1000 grams of crack? 200 years minimum. With no parole. Life in prison was on the table, over a simple formulaic change.  Because crack cocaine was more in use, and more widely distributed by poorer individuals (compared to the pure cocaine powder), this meant there was a larger penalty for people who bought or sold crack cocaine, versus the raw material that the crack cocaine was made with. So while there's no racial component to the law itself, the law creates a situation where poorer individuals can receive a harsher punishment than richer individuals. Due to the nature of poverty in the US, this means that black and Hispanic neighborhoods are more likely to have crack cocaine versus pure cocaine. As some of the numbers above show, black individuals made up some 80% of the people charged under the law, even when two-thirds of the known users were white or Hispanic. Many of these harsher punishments for crack cocaine came from myths and falsehoods about the drug itself being blamed for an uptick in violent crime and being more addictive, though these were proven false after the fact.  Beyond that, because drugs had wildly different markets and popularities amongst different groups or classes of people, any disparity in sentencing between any different drug meant there could be implicit racial biases in sentencing. When contrasted against things like methamphetamines, or even the differences in being accused of selling/distributing a drug versus simple possession, it ensured that there was a bias along racial lines, even if the laws themselves never implied any sort of race or class status to those being charged. Black individuals had far worse outcomes under these new drug laws.  While your friend might still want to argue that it is individuals using laws to create the 'racist' outcomes, I'd point out that the differences in categories in the law is what enables those racist outcomes, regardless of the intent of the wording of those laws. It's similar to the argument against Voter ID laws.  Have a bit of a thought experiment. Say, music's banned and illegal. If all music use is punished equally, then it would be less institutional weight over the individual authority of a judge or police officer, to create the imbalanced racial outcomes in punishing vile music-playing citizens. Now if someone decides that Rap, or R&B, or Jazz music should be punished harsher, and Country music, or Classical, or Easy Listening Rock was punished less harshly... Well, while there's no implicit race mentioned in the laws that enact these unequal punishments, we would understand the social implication of which groups would more likely be harmed most/least by enacting these sort of punitive requirements."

                "content": " Like others are saying here, some form of immersion is key to making the step from knowing a language (in terms of its grammar and vocabulary) to spoken fluency, but those first steps don't need to be done in immersion, and those first steps can be taken pretty quickly if you know what you're doing.  I needed to learn to speak 3-4 languages over the past few years for my job, and in the process have landed on a pretty damn good method.  It got me to C1 fluency in French in about 5 months, and I'm  currently using it with Russian (and plan on reaching C1 equivalent fluency by September).  At this point, I go in 4 stages:        Stage 1: Learn the correct pronunciation of the language.  Doing this does a few things \u2013  because I\u2019m first and foremost learning how to hear that language\u2019s sounds, my listening comprehension gets an immediate boost before I even start traditional language age learning.  Once I start vocabulary training, I retain it better because I\u2019m familiar with how words should sound and how they should be spelled.  (Correct spellings in French, for example, are much easier to remember when there\u2019s a connection between the spelling and the sound), and once I finally start speaking to native speakers, they don't switch to English for me or dumb down their language, which is awesome sauce.    Stage 2: Vocab and grammar acquisition (itself in a few stages), no English allowed  I start with a frequency list and mark off any words I can portray with pictures alone (basic nouns and verbs).  I put those in an Anki deck and learn them.  Once I have some words to play with, I start putting them together.  I use Google translate and a grammar book to start making sentences, then get everything doublechecked at lang-8.com.  Turning them into fill-in-the-blank flashcards builds the initial grammar and connecting words.  As vocab and grammar grow, I eventually move to monolingual dictionaries and writing my own definitions for more abstract words (again doublechecked at lang-8.com).  This builds on itself; the more vocab and grammar you get, the more vocab and grammar concepts you can describe in the target language.  Eventually you can cover all the words in a 2000 word frequency list and any specific vocab you need for your specific interests.    Stage 3: Listening, writing and reading work  Once I have a decent vocabulary and familiarity with grammar, I start writing essays, watching TV shows and reading books.  Every writing correction gets added to the Anki deck, which continues to build my vocab and grammar.    Stage 4: Speech  At the point where I can write 'fluently', I find some place to immerse in the language and speak all the time (literally.  No English allowed or else you won't learn the skill you're trying to learn, which is adapting to holes in your grammar or vocabulary by going around them rapidly and automatically without having to think about it).  I prefer Middlebury college, but a few weeks in the target country will work as well if you're very vigorous with sticking to the target language and not switching to English.  If you're extremely strict with yourself, your brain adapts pretty quickly and learns how to put all the info you learned in stages 1-3 together quickly enough to turn into fluent speech.    I've written a (not yet available) book on the topic and a (now available) website, at http://www.towerofbabelfish.com  Edit: I guess while I'm up here, here are some deep links for more info: * More details on the general topic above  Specific language resources: * Learn French * Learn Spanish * Learn Italian * Learn German * Learn Russian * Learn Japanese * Learn Mandarin Chinese  (Fair warning, book suggestions are Amazon affliliate links.

This, along with other clinical signs (such as coughing, exercise intolerance, lethargy), are very common in dogs with heart disease.  My interpretation of the labs would be as follows:   \\-Increased urea: decreased urea filtration by the kidneys due to insufficient cardiac output (the kidneys just aren't getting the blood pressure they need to filter as efficiently).   \\-Increased ALT and ALP: could it be a liver tumor? Sure. But this could also be due to heart failure and what is called hepatic congestion.   \\-Increased PLT/PCT: this indicates that your dog is making more platelets. I never learned that internal bleeding is a cause of increased platelets. In fact, I learned that it's a rare occurance and we don't really know why it happens. In some cases, it can indicate chronic blood loss, low iron, or a bone marrow disease. Honestly, without anemia (a decrease in RBCs), I would be suspicious of internal bleeding.  If this were my dog, I would be going for a second opinion today and an abdominocentesis. The other individual who commented that vets do not like to perform abdominocentesis is not right. Vets do it all the time. It is safe and a very effective way to get the fluid out of the abdomen. It's not hard on the body, and it won't rob your dog of any nutrients.  If you follow up with a cardiologist, contact them ASAP to see if medications can be adjusted. If you do not have your dog see a cardiologist, I would suggest asking for a referral to one if you'd like to try longer term management. I do want to let you know that at some point, however, dogs with heart failure can no longer be medically managed. I cannot tell you this is the case without doing an exam."

In severe cases blades are used that would indeed expose the skin, but that is never the goal. There are also options to go shorter that don't require going so short. There are guard combs to achieve longer lengths. As long as the matting isn't super severe. Leaving mats because \"it'll damage the coat\" is far more detrimental to the overall well being of the pet. As far as damaging the coat, in my 14 years of experience(in GA)  the only dogs that do struggle are the elders. And it's not that their coat didn't come back, it just took a while. With proper bathing and brushing during the grow back phase, all should be well. Take care of the skin, and the coat will reflect that."

We had a vet come to our house for a home visit because we have worked with them in the past. We just needed a simple vet visit to get his shots updated, and in a few weeks we will have him neutered. He normally does very well with others, never shows signs of aggression towards people or animals, and just normally has a ton of energy.   Today when the vet came inside, everything went well at first. When the vet started to check him out, he got a little feisty and almost tried to bite him. We grabbed a muzzle and I feel it almost made things worse, but we didn\u2019t want him biting anyone so we had to do it. He started flopping around and barking and almost managed to pull his muzzle off. They finished most of his vaccines and said they were unable to do a blood draw for heart worms, due to him not cooperating.   Is this a red flag for us?

He was originally a foster who had \u201cpneumonia\u201d but when he wasn\u2019t improving I adopted him so I could take over his medical care.   After seeing 4 vets, including specialists, multiple xrays, blood work, and cardiology appointments, it was determined that he has an entire host of congenital defects. His lungs completely lack blood flow in the front, his heart has a bad valve, he has bone marrow issues, and kidney issues.   The thing is, he behaves like he\u2019s perfectly fine. He plays and runs and jumps and purrs. He\u2019s adorable and full of fun. The vet said he behaves this way because his defects are all he\u2019s ever known so he is used to feeling bad. But the vet also said that as he grows, his body will struggle more and that he is a ticking time bomb for catastrophic health failure and that he likely wouldn\u2019t die instantly but suffer before we could get him to the vet. She said it\u2019s not if but when and could happen anytime.  I love him so much. I don\u2019t want to euthanize him. But he is becoming sexually mature and we can\u2019t neuter him because he wouldn\u2019t survive anesthesia. He\u2019s starting to get pissy to our other cats.

Some people in my life have said I should wait to euthanize until he is suffering. The vet said with all of his issues it is appropriate to euthanize at any point, and this has been confirmed by 4 other vets. My thinking is that I\u2019d rather his last day be a happy day and not one where he is in agony. I am considering calling the mobile vet to come to our house to euthanize in the next week or so.  I\u2019m literally gutted by this. I don\u2019t know what plan is right. He can\u2019t survive his issues and they can\u2019t be treated.

Very few pet parents go through the ordeal of seeking four \"second opinions\" for their animal's condition, and I truly do empathize for your extremely difficult journey.   From the language in your post, it seems like you understand euthanasia is going to be the most likely end for Bubbles. If his body could fail at any moment now, the stressors of continued growth and development could very well cause his physical condition and pain level deteriorate. Your vet said much the same, so I won't dwell on that any longer.   As a vet tech I feel, for cases in which the animal's condition will never improve beyond their current state, the most humane option is to euthanize early. This sounds very harsh, and I apologize again, but at this stage you are still able to control for their level of happiness and make at least one, final day of good memories. You can still give them special meals, take them to their favorite places, and simply sit, quietly, and hold them while they sleep. A person's animal doesn't know or understand why these things are happening to them, but they do understand the depth of their person's love. These things are no longer possible when that animal comes to us as an emergency, and I think the absence of those final, good memories makes it much more difficult for an animal's person to find closure.   The final decision remains yours, in the end. You seem to have a lot of empathy for Bubbles' condition, and your heart will tell you what is right. If you do decide euthanasia is the best course of action for Bubbles, please understand that we will be with you every step of the way. We will do our best to make the environment safe and comfortable, and we will wait until you are truly ready before we begin. If you are not able to remain in the room at the end, we will hold them and love them as if they were our own. Everybody cries, it never gets any easier, and we never forget the animals we help cross the bridge - but we will carry the burden together, knowing their time was peaceful and loving rather than scary or painful. No story could want for a better end.  Good luck to you, genuinely. I wish you both the best on your journey, and I hope you can find happiness in the final days with your friend."

We rescued a 8 week old puppy last weekend. When we got her she had just received her first round of vaccines the day before. She was extremely lethargic and didn\u2019t want to move at all except to go to the bathroom. She barely ate and drank water but had a little bit of food, which we thought was because she was adjusting or her vaccine. The next day she vomited and had diarrhea so we immediately took her to the emergency animal hospital and they said she has parvo. She\u2019s getting care now and the prognosis looks good so we should be able to pick her up in a day or so. We were originally planning to take her to puppy preschool where she could socialize with other puppies in a clean environment prior to all her vaccinations being complete, but now I\u2019m guessing we probably won\u2019t be able to attend that for a while.  We were thinking we should deep clean the apartment with bleach before she comes home, but I read that she would be shedding the virus up to 2 weeks after she recovers so then I thought maybe it makes sense to clean after that point so we can possibly join the puppy socialization classes in 2-3 weeks. But then I read that Parvo lives in carpet and other surfaces for many many months, so now I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s even worth cleaning and this means she won\u2019t be able to attend any socialization classes until 16 weeks, which concerns me a bit.  TLDR; puppy is recovering from parvo and seems to be doing well. Once she comes home and is fully recovered, we want to prioritize training and socializing, but not at risk of other puppies.

He eats primal raw and we blend it up in a blender with just water and a bit of goat milk. He used to be on a kibble diet when we got him but the regurgitation was so bad that he would end up losing too much bodyweight to the point that a number of vets advised us to put him down. One vet said just put him down now, he won't make it through the night. In our stubbornness to keep him alive, we found that he was able to keep a liquid diet down far easier and was able to put back on weight. For two days after the second vet told us to put him down, we put him on an all goat milk diet and he sprang back like a champ. At his lowest he got was around 7 lbs but now he's in the low teens. https://i.imgur.com/nBHf1tZ.jpeg  It took a while to figure out how to properly feed him and he is constantly scrounging the kitchen floors or the area where the kids snack and watch tv for anything he can get in his belly. He's like a horse, doesn't know when to stop eating. During that time he picked up a habit of jumping that made him regurgitate, where he licks it up and tries to jump again. For the past few months he's gotten a lot better where he'd jump less and less and regurgitated less and less. He went from throwing up 5+ times a day to once every day or two.  I think if I can get him to stop jumping and to somehow satisfy his appetite, I can get him in a better place but Im at a loss as to what my options are. When he's bad, it's really bad. It got so bad that we had to get rid of our carpets due to all the stains. Though that was a blessing in disguise as we needed a reason to get rid of the carpet anyways. Just seeing if anyone has any ideas on how to help. Thanks\n\nAssistant:"

I had a 12 week old kitten that was happy and healthy (I thought) until this morning after having to be rushed to vet and put to sleep. Yesterday I noticed bruising on Sunnys ears and belly. (I will add a photo) but otherwise he was fine. Playing, eating, etc. But the bruising concerned me so I called the emergency vet and sent photos. They advised that it could wait til Monday so long as he was playing and eating. Which he was so we went about the day. I noticed he wanted to sit by the heating vent and to snuggle right under us that night. Now it was probably because he was so cold. This morning we woke up to him puking and gagging up foam. And was so listless. We rushed him to vet where on the way he pooped which looked like deer poop but solid, was throwing up blood, and crying. It was horrific. When we got to vet he had declined significantly and his breathing was rapid and his temperature had dropped and he was having seizures. Dr advise tht he wouldn\u2019t make it and he had to be put the sleep. Drs opinion was a genetic clotting disorder. I have racked my brain with why this happened. I told the vet that he had gotten into soup broth on Friday but dr said that couldnt cause this. We don\u2019t have rat poison in our home or any chemicals he could reach. I would just like to get other\u2019s opinions as this all happened so fast. And now I\u2019m home wondering how this could happen. We are devastated.

Really need help...please.  tldr: My dog woke up blind the day after his neuter. Clinic only cared to know that it's not their fault. Blood work came back clean. Eye specialist can't draw conclusion. Option to spend 3-4K to remove eyes or put dog down.  &#x200B;  This began Wednesday Nov 7th at 9am, we took our dog Boomer(almost 2 years old) to the vet in Calgary for a neuter. This was the same vet we took our older dog Ghengis(2.5 years old) to for his neuter 6 months ago. He was give his first shot of anesthesia? and then we went outside to walk around a bit until the drug kicked in. We brought him to the back and left them in their care. Boomer was picked up around 2pm. He seemed alright, slow moving but we figured it was the after effects of the surgery. Later on in the evening he was pawing at his eye somewhat but didn't think much of it since it's not too unusual for a dog.  On Thursday Nov 8th, my girlfriend noticed around 9am that he wasn't really opening his eye when she called for him. Though he usually sleeps in til later anyways. Around 11:30 she wanted to take him for his walk and thats when she noticed his blue-ish eye colour. We carried him to a well lit room and saw his eyes were completely clouded! We freaked out as we see he's walking into things.  We called the vet immediately and they didn't answer 8 times. We decided to just drive over there immediately and see what they say about it. We arrived and the receptionist was shocked and said they were busy and that's why they couldn't answer the phone but then she answers one \"is this an emergency or can you hold.\" Immediate red flag to how they are running things. She then went to the back and grabbed the surgeon who performed the neuter. This was the most frustrating part since the first 5 mins he talked, he just asked us questions such as \"He was fine when he left here right? Are you sure this didn't happen before the surgery? There's no way it could have happened here. There are thousands of neuters in Calgary and I've never seen this happen.\" He was just trying to wash his hands of all this and can see he didn't want any part of it. He looked at the eye a bit, shined light into Boomer's eye and then said he's not an eye specialist so he couldn't tell us what's wrong or why it happened but it definitely wasn't him. He recommended a vet hospital that had an dog eye specialist, ophthalmologist.  We went there right after and the nurses took us in, only waited for a little bit before we had the person before the specialist come do a early diagnosis of what is going on. We find out that the ophthalmologist is in surgery for the day so it would be about a few hours before he would get to take a look. We were told to leave Boomer there until he can be seen. We had to pay a minimum deposit of $350 and then left. We received a call about 3-4 hours later and saw the ophthalmologist immediately. He told that Boomer has uvetis. Really bad inflammation in the eyes, causing the cloudiness. The high scale of a dog's eyes is 25...Boomer's were 60 and 70. His retina and everything behind the eye was still good and there's a possibility he could get his vision back. He said we should do blood work so we can find out what the cause of this would be. In the mean time he prescribed some medication for Boomer to take until we see him again on Tuesday Nov 13th.  We got Dorzotimolol, Prednisolone, Meloxicam, Amoxicillin, and Doxycycline. We gave the evening dosage for him since it was already late in the day. We made a chart and kept track of when we give Boomer these meds. We then noticed a big lump on his back, maybe that was swollen from a needle? As the next few days went by, we noticed his eyes were getting droopy, the whites of his eyes were becoming extremely red. By Sunday it became less red, more bluish. We get a early call from the ophthalmologist saying the blood work so far came back clean. So it couldn't be some disease, or cancer, or anything like that. His white blood cell count was really high. Still, no one can draw a conclusion so far. For such a hyper dog, it's heartbreaking to see him just lie there still and not move.  At this point we are lost to what can cause this. HOW DOES A DOG WAKE UP BLIND??? The neuter clinic HASN'T CALLED BACK EVEN ONCE just to check up on Boomer.Especially with those high pressure numbers, it doesn't just instantly happen like that if this was some other sources. We begin speculating and researching as many possibilities as possible. How does Uvetis work, could it have been an over dose of anesthesia? Was there unsanitary equipment that could cause infection?  On Monday Nov 12th we went over to the neuter clinic again and requested for the surgical notes for the neuter as well as paperwork for our first dog's neuter as well to compare. When we asked for these notes, we understand that they just require clearance from the head surgeon before she can release them which is understandable. What didn't make sense is why she took the phone to the back and closed the door so we couldn't hear anything. Just seemed very suspecious.  The other surgeon came out to talked to us. Again just tried to reassured that it's not likely that it happened there.  On Tuesday Nov 13th, my girlfriend took Boomer back to the ophthalmologist to do the follow up. He says Boomer won't be getting his vision back, so he's now permanently blind. He used a needle and took some fluids from the lump on his back and found lots of dead cells, white blood cells and neutricells? Again unable to determine the cause of it. At this point we have no idea what the cause is. The inflammation in Boomer's eye is causing him pain. We are then presented with 2 options. 1) Surgery to remove his eyes, approx $1800/eye. Hoping that once they remove the eye, they could possibly dissect the eye to try and find a cause. 2) Put him down, he won't be able to continue barring the pain with his eyes. We try to call another clinic but they would require us to pay another $210 just to see them. Again not guarantee if they'll even find anything different.  After a day of trying to research more, looking for second opinions we don't what to do but we need to make a decision soon. Searching online we found many stories of cats and dogs going blind after surgery because of overdose of drugs and what not. After all those tests and specialists not one being able to even say at this time what is the most probable cause, just leaves a bad distaste of vets. The timing is way too coincidental.  So this is my last hope to ask the internet for help. Any advice or opinions from other vets or specialists would be great. Would love to hear if there have been similar situations that people have experienced before.  Pictures and files in link below  https://imgur.com/a/sIzD5Uv\n\nAssistant:"

To cut a long story short this crazy old woman was feeding him and he kept returning to her house and eventually stopped coming here. She decided to tell me after knowing I was looking for him 4 months because she is now moving house. She insists he didn't sleep inside but only came to eat and left. She had named him Ali apparently because he was King of the Ring and fighting the other cats in the area.   He was never really aggressive before, up until about a week before he left and didn't come back. On the last day he sat in front of the house for about 9 hours and growled at me if I tried to move him. He was really uptight as if he was guarding my house.   I have another cat and they don't like each other but they mostly stay away from each other. That being said, she gave birth about 12 weeks ago, about 4 weeks before he left and I saw them fighting in the street just before this before I broke it up and brought her inside. I'm assuming she was territorial.   But he's here now and he's dying to go outside but I don't think I should let him out because he's clearly formed a bond with the lady and I don't want to make it worse.   He's only been back a day but he's aggressive with the other cats, including the little kittens and he's been aggressive with me. That being said, there are clearly things he remembers about me. For example, if I make a certain sound with my lips he kisses me, something we used to do before he left. In fact, we were really close before he left. This is a cat who would accompany me on a 30 minute walk in the daytime. He was always on my heels. Now he won't even come near me and he's clawing at the doors and windows.  For more context, he got the snip 2 weeks before he left too and he was pretty annoyed with me around that point too. He repeatedly looked at his balls and me and to make it worse when I went to collect him from this ladies house he was frantic. Later on he acted this way again when I was carrying the carrier around the house (to put it back in the cupboard) he growled at me.   Pls help, what can I do to help him settle again? Should I just let him go outside if he would prefer to be out there? How should I respond to the aggressive behaviours?\n\nAssistant:"

Those prices sound quite high but I do not live in California. Call every vet in your area within a few mile radius and communicate that your dog has a closed pyometra and needs surgery and ask if they can give you a ballpark price range because you are financially limited. Try humane societies as well.   As others have said, look into Care Credit or scratch pay as well. I wish you and your dog good luck."

Most will have exams in the am and possibly bloodwork, and then they get pre-medication to help with anxiety and to lightly sedate them. This makes it easier to anesthetize as it's very difficult to anesthetize anxious animals (drugs take longer to take effect and side effects can be worse). Usually after exams and bloodwork is done, the animals will get scheduled into the day. The premeds usually last a few hours so they just hangout in their runs or crates/cages to chill while other animals have their surgeries.   When it's their time for surgery they usually feel pretty good (premeds make them feel a little loopy but easier to handle and quiet). Some with get IV lines placed to be able to induce anesthesia, and to have fluids during the procedure if that's something your doctor does. Then they get their induction agent, this is what makes then unconscious, most of the drugs used in animal med are similar to those used in people. When the animal is completely asleep and unconscious, they will get an endotracheal tube to help deliver oxygen and a vapor that will keep them asleep during the procedures.   When the procedure is done, the animal will be placed in a safe area, usually a cage or crate with blankets and someone watching to make sure they wake up safely and are not too anxious. (Pets don't always understand why they feel loopy). Once they are awake and not any danger to themselves they are left to sleep/stay In a quiet area to recover. They usually have residual anesthesia or drugs in their systems still for a while after the procedure is done so the doctor will keep the pets for a few hours to make sure they are fully awake and walking before letting them go home.   Most procedures are pretty quick, but the before and after can take a while. This is just to ensure a safe and happy pet will go home after.   Hope this helps! If you have any questions you can ask."

He already had 1/4 of his teeth missing from previous cleanings/extractions, so now he only has 3 teeth left (fangs).  The vet dentist explained that two teeth were absolutely horrible and x rays showed that there were a few more that also didn't look very good. Initially she was only going to treat the teeth that were diseased, but the anesthesiologist recommended getting rid of all the teeth so that my cat wouldn't have to undergo anesthesia again (due to his kidney issue).  The thing is, the vet didn't call me to ask my permission to perform such a procedure, which, from what I understand is a major operation.   I'm not saying that I would have said no to this, I probably would have agreed because I understand the benefits of such a radical extraction.

Her body was shutting down but her spirit wanted to keep living. She still ate. She didn\u2019t understand her legs weren\u2019t working anymore. She wanted to pee and poo outside despite diapers. However, She did wine/whistle a tad as she was sleeping over the past week. We assumed it was pain. She weighed 9 kg.   The vet gave her a dose of sedative and asked us to wait 15 mins. She became super agitated and started howling a lot. My partner was freaking out and getting angry. She eventually fell asleep but woke back up howling. The vet kept saying it was normal but lacked empathy. My boyfriend recalls he grabbed her snout and pulled down her face in an attempt to calm her but he was rough about it. This really upset him. He said What the fuck at which point the vet, an older man, raised his voice at him! I tried calming everyone down but it was tense. They made us pay in the middle of the wait time after giving the sedative. She hadn\u2019t even passed yet. I think it\u2019s because my boyfriend swore at the situation. He wanted his dog to go peacefully which wasn\u2019t really the case. The vet explained to me he gave a dose that wouldn\u2019t induced cardiac arrest fir a 10kg weight because of her murmur. The sedative was being given for putting the IV.   Our dog was going through bouts if conciousness and unconciousness and it felt like forever. She was howling. We were distressed. At some point i knocked on their office door and asked for the propofol injection. Which they gave. But they offered more sedative and made me question my decision to put her to sleep ASAP. She died during that injection. She didn\u2019t make it to the shot that was supposed to kill her.   I put down my other dog in 2019. She just had propofol and the actual euthanasia. It wasn\u2019t that distressing for the dog. No sedative, they just put in the IV. That dog was, however, closer to actual death having stopped eating. She was very tired. She went peacefully.   My question is, was that reaction to the sedative normal? Did she have pain from it or was it confusion? My partner and I are disturbed by her reaction to it and her howling. We hope she didn\u2019t realize we were killing her. We hope she didn\u2019t have pain. We feel her last moments were not peaceful like they were for our other dog.   Thank you\n\nAssistant:"

In my many years of veterinary experience, I have witnessed and been honored to share in the passing of many pets, and have seen a very broad spectrum of passings.  It seems, in this case, that you were not prepared for the range of reactions in pets that can take place.  I'm sorry this has caused you to worry.  Although your experience was within the normal spectrum, it's not what we as veterinary professionals consider to be ideal.  Please realize that we cannot control your pet's reaction to the medications.   Most passings are brief and are simply a release, where the pet succumbs to the process and passes within a few minutes.  However some pets experience an \"excitement phase\" during the process, which is simply the pet's brain reacting to the solution and not an indication of pain.  It is the body's way of releasing energy, nothing more.    I'm so sorry you were not prepared that this type of phase can happen before the procedure.  We cannot predict which pets will have this reaction and as practitioners, we always do all we can to help the passing go smoothly.  We are all secretly hoping your pet won't be the one with the excitement phase.   One thing you probably don't realize is that we never become immune to the owners' anguish and emotions of their pet's  passing, and although we are professional and keep our composure, we are right there with you in those final moments, letting go of your pet as you are.  I've never heard many veterinary professionals admit this, but it's there.  We have witnessed your pets at their most wounded and weak moments, and comforted and reassured you through those experiences, so you and they are part of our lives and hearts as well."

While my male friend hasn't had a single date so far and that's not due to a lack of trying. Now even though at the end of the day they are both still single, the women at least go on dates which mean she has a higher chance to find someone compared to the man who hasn't been on a single date.  This brings me to my first point. The average woman has a lot more options compared to the average man. I remember reading a survey that said that on average women are asked about 12 times a year compared to asking less than 1 guy out. And when we introduce online dating it gets even worse. On average a woman has a match rate of 30% while a man has 0.013%. This means that statistically, women have a lot more opportunities to meet the one compared to a man. More options are better than fewer options.  My second point comes down to the average dating strategy. The average woman is a lot more passive than a man, in the man is still the one doing the asking out and trying to impress the woman. This means that women have the option to just passively exist and they just pick and choose from their options. In addition to that, they always have the option of becoming proactive and going after the guys they want if they don't like their options. Compared that to the average guy whose only option is to actively go out looking for women and initiating stuff, since if he just stayed and waited for women to approach he will remain single.  And finally, there is the problem that till about the age of 54 there are just more men than women.\n\nAssistant:"

Every woman that supposedly has had a way easier time than men finding a relationship has had exactly as many relationships, total, as the men who supposedly struggle.  I think you're conflating two things, because they are correlated for men in a way they aren't for women.  For men, *attention* from the opposite sex and *romance* from the opposite sex are correlated. Men typically struggle getting attention from women, see women getting lots of attention, and assume they are having an easier time out there.  But for women, attention isn't as strongly correlated. For women, the signal to noise ratio leans heavily towards noise, because a sizable percentage of men are douchebags.  So getting attention isn't the problem. In fact the main problem is too.much attention, and having to sort through to find the guys that aren't jerks, assholes, potential rapists, etc.  So no, it's not easier for women. It's just different."

When you have multiple parties, you don't have to try and appeal to the middle. In fact, the more parties there are, the more \"extreme\" you get, with different parties focusing on certain things towards the edge of the political spectrum.

So for example if a 100m sprint took place and there were 4 black people and 4 white people in the sprint, if nothing about their training, preparation or the sprint itself was influenced by decisions on the basis of race/ethnicity and the first 4 finishers were black, that would be a disproportionate outcome but not racist.   I appreciate that my example may not have been the best but I hope you understand my overall position.  Disproportionate outcomes with respect to any identity group (race, gender, sex, height, weight etc) are inevitable as we are far more than our identity (our choices, our environment, our upbringing, our commitment, our ambition etc), these have a great influence on outcomes.

If i were to expect men and women to be equally capable of following laws, then I would expect them to be similarly likely to get arrested and sentenced for crimes.   It would be really weird to say that fat people having the most heart attacks, might be explained by them being more than their identity as being fat, and maybe it is a result of personal choices that are unrelated to being fat. Because it is clearly not unrelated.   At best, there is a correlation between the thing that makes people fat, and the thing that makes people heart attack-prone.

Problems with lethal injection:  \\-Companies do not want to sell drugs to states for executions, so new drug cocktails have to keep being made as previous drugs become unavailable. The guillotine obviously does not have this problem.  \\-Lethal injection is easy to botch. A new drug cocktail might be horrendous. A high-quality vein might not be found, causing the drug to spill out and botch the execution. The sedative might not work, causing the prisoner to feel immense pain. The staff might be incompetent since most doctors would break their Hippocratic Oath and execute someone.     How the guillotine solves these problems:  \\-The guillotine does not require drug suppliers  \\-The guillotine does not require trained medical professionals. While the guillotine can be botched, it is significantly harder than with lethal injection. If the blade is sharp enough and the drop height is sufficient, it is a nearly foolproof method.  \\-The guillotine is almost painless. Even if there is some pain, it is nothing compared to a bad lethal injection. A guillotine execution cannot drag on like lethal injection.  \\-The guillotine is also better than electrocution (has been botched many times, people have even survived it) or hanging (extremely painful suffocation death if the drop is insufficient)\n\nAssistant:"

However, I have trouble taking this label for the God that most people think they believe. The reason is that nobody seems to be able to give a coherent definition on what they mean by God.  Let me explain. I can define Zeus as a human like creature that lives on Olympus mountain and throws lightning bolts during thunder. This is a coherent definition and I can take a position that I don't believe such thing exists. Take another one. Santa Claus is an old man dressed in red coat who lives in Lapland and delivers gifts to children in Christmas. Again, the definition is understandable and coherent and I can take a position that I don't believe such thing exists.  Some parts of the God of the Old Testament fits in this kind of a category. The God is a physical being looking like a human that created the earth and lives in heaven (=above clouds). He physically gave the tablets to Moses. He physically appeared to some people. And so on. Again this is sort of an understandable definition and I can say that I don't believe such thing exists.  But I don't think most Christians nowadays believe in such God. The definitions that I have heard are immaterial, timeless, all powerful, wise, the creator of universe. The last three don't actually define what God is. The last one just tells what he did. The powerful and wise are adjectives that define some of his attributes compared to other beings, but do not define what God is.  The first one is probably the most interesting. I could possibly believe that God is something that started the universe but has never interfered with the material world since. If this is the case, I would argue that this kind of God doesn't exist any more. It also contradicts the all powerful since what does it mean to be powerful, if you have zero influence on anything?  But I don't think this is the God that most theists believe in. And that leads to a problem. If God is immaterial how does he interact with material world? Or put it the other way, if God interacts with the material world, how is he then immaterial? And if we dump this immaterial label, then there has to be some way to define God in same kinds of terms as I defined Zeus and Santa Claus above.  So, my claim is that I don't think most religious people have really thought through what exactly it is that they believe in. I know, I hadn't when I was young and believed in God. Only when I got older and started thinking it more deeply, I realised that I just couldn't define the God that I used to believe in any meaningful way that either didn't immediately lead to contradictions or wasn't obviously non-existent (even to my former self).  So, I'm not after a definition that's necessarily consistent with Bible or any other religious text, but just a definition that a normal person can understand. The cop-out that \"God is beyond the understanding of humans\" doesn't really lead to anything, because even in this case if you want to say that you believe (or not believe) in God, you have to have some concept in your mind that what exactly is the thing that you say that you believe in. If I say to you that I believe that FNFKNKF exists and you then ask what is FNFKNKF and I say that it's beyond your understanding, would you be able to say that you believe or don't believe that FNFKNKF exists?  So, change my view, give me a definition of God that you or someone that you know believes in and that at least you yourself comprehend. _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

Depression does not have a uniform cause or presentation. We can't point to a clear thing about depression and say definitively this is what depression *is*, we can only say this is what depression *does*, and if these symptoms exist, that indicates the presence of depression.   Despite only being defined in terms of what it does to us, rather than what it \"is\", I have no trouble believing depression exists. Do you?   The same applies for one of those definitions of God--creator of the universe. You could go the easy route and view God as the Treponema pallidum pallidum that causes the universe. Or, instead I think you could view creating of the universe as what God did. Like the cause of many cases of depression is unknown/unknowable, so too is the exact nature of God, but that doesn't mean we can't look at the symptoms (i.e. existence) and define the condition in reverse like depression. If all we know is what it does, we can still believe in it.   (I don't think it's necessary to look at a created universe and then believe in God, to be clear.

However, this human capital is linked to and was created in conjunction with industry (manufacturing of any kind): human capital is sustained by the manufacturing sector, and the manufacturing sector is sustained and advanced by human capital. 3. At the end of the day, the country and people who do the manufacturing will prevail, because the people involved with that manufacturing are developing and sustaining their own human capital associated with this manufacturing. 4. This new human capital will fuel schools, professional services, and an economy that will eventually supplant the need to import these services from other countries (like the United States). 5. That is why in the United States, we should be very worried about manufacturing increasingly moving overseas. Looking around at the room you're in (or just at the computer or phone you're using), where was it made? Sure, it may have been designed or even assembled here, but it's only a matter of time before other countries, like China, will take over all of those roles. 6. Once that happens, and other countries are entirely self-sufficient over the supply chain, what will we in this country have to offer as a good or service? If we can't offer anything or value, our economy will suffer.\n\nAssistant:"

However, I really can't see how someone can support who Donald Trump is as a person, and honestly he appears to be so abhorrent that any person who celebrates him as a person, not his policies, deserves pretty harsh criticism. By this point everyone knows all of his controversies, suffice to say he is an extreme narcissist who has consistently said very problematic things for a long time now. If you are aligning yourself with his statements on things like race, gender, and how he has treated women in his personal life, you deserve to be criticized.\n\nAssistant:"

In the wake of the shooting at the congressional baseball game, there have already been posts about how \"ridiculous\" it is that the house cancelled a hearing on gun legislation after the event. Similarly, after nearly every single mass shooting, there is an argument by the right saying that we shouldn't politicize tragedies while the left says that in the wake of such a tragedy is a perfect time to talk about gun control legislation.  However, after the recent terrorist attacks in London, Donald Trump attempted to use the tragedy to push his muslim ban policy (which he, and certain segments of the right believe would help prevent terrorist attacks). The left was immediately outraged at how he could politicize such a tragedy.  The fact of the matter is that both sides use such tragedies to push their pet agendas (gun control from the left, various anti-terrorism policies from the right) and both sides decry the behavior when it is being engaged in by the other side.  I know it is no huge suprise that politicians are hypocrites, but the same stuff seems to get said by the regular people supporting those politicians, at least here on Reddit.  So, CMV: People who push for gun control legistlation after shootings or anti-terrorism laws after attacks but decry the politicization of tragedies are both hypocrites.  Also, not particularly related to this CMV, but both sides are wrong and none of their ideas would do much to reduce the tragedies they are concerned about while simultaneously infringing on our freedoms.\n\nAssistant:"

Liberals see gun control as a real solution to shootings, but Muslim bans as \"politicizing\" because they don't think Muslim bans do anything to address terrorism, but actually just cause more of it.  Conservatives see Muslim bans as a real solution to terrorism, whereas taking away legal guns after a shooting is \"politicizing\" because it's not a real solution to the problem to them (hence you see comments about how \"good guys with guns\" could have stopped the tragedy).

My basic refusal to believe in Christianity started by simple methods of critical thinking, like \"who created God?\". Although this possibly the worst argument against an omnipotent being, it was the start of my skepticism. This post isn't more so focused on the argument of God's existence, but rather the potential of it.  God is often portrayed as an omnibenevolent being in Christianity, having personal relationships with every human being. First and foremost, we need to understand that there is suffering happening right now, for all animals (including humans). To me this points to God not being omnibenevolent, although I'll go over some potential explanations. And after that, I'll explain why I think it's more plausible that God is either evil, or not an omnipotential being (which would contradict Christianity as a whole).  \"Suffering in this world happens because God gave us free will\". I find plenty of things wrong with this argument. First of all, while we might have a so called \"free will\", we cannot choose what our desires are freely. I can choose to listen to progressive metal, as my brain likes the sound of the genre. I can also choose to not listen to it and rather listen to music I dislike, which seems like it proves free will. However, the reason I listen to something else is in that case is because I desire to disprove the argument. I still won't do something without a desire behind it. And we cannot choose our desires freely. If suffering truly is a consequence of free will, how come we can't choose what we want? Are we even truly free then? To me, that either points to the evolutionary theory or that God didn't give us total free will. And by that standard, suffering shouldn't be a necessity. If we're not free anyway, why should suffering still be a consequence?  \"In order for us to feel pleasure and happiness, we need suffering to compare\". This is completely true in our world today I'd say. We cannot feel safe without the knowledge of danger, and we cannot feel satisfaction without the knowledge of dissatisfaction. A world without pain is also a world without pleasures, a totally neutral world (I'd argue that would be a better world for us, but that is besides the point). To me, this argument falls flat when we describe God as an omnibenevolent being. What is stopping him from creating a reality in which suffering is not needed for us to feel pleasure? A truly omnibenevolent being would have no issue with this.  \"God has a different goal, unknown to us\". This I find the most compelling argument, and hard to argue. This might very well be the case, but how can we even rationalize this? What goal could an omnibenevolent being have, which is not to create pleasure? Moreso, why would his goal include suffering as the means? Wouldn't an omnibenevolent being's goal be to minimize suffering as he loves us all equally? I don't see a way where our suffering is a necessity for any goal which is benevolent.  The last point I'll make is a reason that points to God not being omnibenevolent, or in fact evil. If the case is that the believers of God will go to Heaven, and non-believers will go to Hell, why is he hiding from most of us? I have been around Christianity my whole life, gone to sunday-school, been in COUNTLESS social events with Christianity ingrained. I've tried to pray, tried to feel his presence during ceremonies, I feel as if he won't respond to me. My whole life has been extremely tough due to emetophobia, and I don't see how that suffering is justifiable for any goal. If he is so omnibenevolent and want us to be with him in Heaven, why is he hiding? I've seen people make the claim that Hell isn't endless torture and suffering, but rather a place separate for his non-believers to not be with him. What about those that want to be with him, but can't get any response?  There are probably many flaws in my argument, so please point them out if you notice! Thanks for reading!\n\nAssistant:"

For a while, and now more than ever (e.g.  https://www.reddit.com/r/JusticeServed/comments/h9qd31/this\\_made\\_my\\_monday\\_a\\_little\\_easier/ ), I see people losing their jobs because they show their bigotry (or more rarely simple social conservatism) in public, get recorded on video, become viral, and lose their jobs. They lose their jobs in private companies, companies that have nothing to do with politics. They lose jobs, where their performance does not depend on their public or social views (this is an assumption).   &#x200B;  I don't see a job as simply a way for an individual to make money, it is also a foundational pillar of the economy and a functioning society. As such, a good performance on a particular job helps not only the performer and the employer, but also the society as a whole. I don't care what my barista does in his free time; all I care about is whether (s)he makes good coffee.

PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE ARGUMENT BEFORE POSTING  Firstly, let me say that even though the title explicitly names two races of people, this argument can be applied to any group who meets the criteria I am about to lay out.   Secondly, this argument only applies to people who actually believe in the concept of affirmative action in any sense. I understand not all people even believe affirmative action is necessary and/or ethical.   Even though many have nuanced and differing views of what affirmative action is, my argument only relies on the general, and almost unanimously accepted definition of what affirmative action is. To me, affirmative action is: The policy of providing special opportunities for, and favoring members of, a disadvantaged group who suffer from discrimination (straight from Wikipedia)  Here is my argument:   1.\tIt is clear that African Americans do face discrimination, lack of opportunities, negative systematic and historical racial bias and/or a number of other negative factors which affects them in the game of academic college admission.   2.\tAffirmative action seeks to \u2018balance the playing field\u2019 by providing proportionally equal special consideration and/or opportunities to these people who face some amount of discrimination. To explain, if -X is the difficulty caused by discrimination, lack of opportunities etc, then +X is the amount of consideration affirmative action seeks to employ into the college admission game for that group of people.    3.\tAsian Americans face similar, yet probably not as extreme discrimination and/or cultural tropes (scrawny smart nerd vs. big, black football/basketball player), lack of being taken seriously athletically (similar to what women experience when in positions of power compared to men  \u2013 they aren\u2019t taken as seriously, or when blacks report actually being made fun of in school for performing well in classes), and pushed at a young age into a non-athletic role (super-majority of Asian men expected to become doctors, lawyers, engineers vs. Blacks expected to become athletes, musicians, and entertainers). So again, if \u2013Y is the difficulty caused by discrimination, then +Y should be applied to this group of people in the area they face \u2013Y in. If you don\u2019t believe that this discrimination exists in D1 Basketball/Football recruitment just look at Jeremy Lin. It is pretty much factual that some amount of very significant discrimination does exist for this race of people. A good article about it: http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1595238-jeremy-lins-60-minutes-interview-points-out-racial-discrimination-in-basketball   4.\t There is nothing a priori that makes educational opportunity more important than athletic opportunity. Both are valid and legitimate ways of enriching your life through and pursuing a career and future. People should have equality of opportunity to choose for themselves which path they wish to take.    5.\tThus, proponents who call for African American Affirmative Action to equalize and account for the amount of discrimination Blacks face in regard to academic opportunity should concede that the only fair and proper way to implement college Affirmative Action is to equalize and account for the amount of discrimination other races (namely Asians) face in regard to athletic opportunity.    Note: My argument only proposes that an equal amount of positive discrimination be applied to the group facing an equal amount of negative discrimination. It is entirely possible, and probably likely, that the amount of negative discrimination that Blacks face in regard to academic opportunity is more than the negative discrimination Asians face toward D1 Football/Basketball recruitment. However, it still holds that however much amount of negative discrimination Asians face should be equalized by Affirmative Action just like it is proposed to do for African Americans.

I will go over the reasons I see most often cited as a justification for pulling out and explain why each of them is wrong in my opinion. &#x200B; 1. The US shouldn\u2019t have been in Afghanistan in the first place. &#x200B; Even if that is correct, it is also completely irrelevant. What\u2019s in the past is in the past and everyone has to do with the present. &#x200B; 2. The Afghan people support the Taliban. &#x200B; First, they don\u2019t. Polls show that over 85% of Afghans oppose the Taliban and an overwhelming majority of Afghans believe that equality for women is a vital matter. &#x200B; Second, even if most of them were supporting the Taliban \u2013 which they aren\u2019t \u2013 that does not justify the oppression of the ones who oppose them, and the West\u2019s de-facto support of that oppression via turning a blind eye. This conjures to mind images of pre-WW2 Germany, after the Nazi\u2019s ascension to power but before their invasion of Poland. If the Germans decided to exterminate their 523,000 strong Jewish population, without harming any other nations\u2019 sovereignty, had the West \u201cstayed out of it\u201d because it was the will of the German people? I\u2019m very much afraid the likely answer would be yes, especially regarding the US, the so-called bastion of freedom and equality that refused to join the war until it was itself attacked. And if you believe that staying out of genocides because is right because \u201cthey\u2019re internal matters\u201d, then I can\u2019t call that position anything but monstrously inhumane and anything but liberal and humanistic. While a wholesale genocide because of the Taliban\u2019s takeover of Afghanistan won\u2019t likely happen, horrible crimes against humanity, the killing of the people who assisted the West, and the repression of Ethnic/Religious minorities will most certainly happen. &#x200B; 3. The Afghan government/democracy wasn\u2019t working anyway, so it doesn\u2019t matter. &#x200B; Most Afghans were satisfied with their democracy, at least in 2019. It is also inarguable that the US occupation of Afghanistan dramatically improved the condition of women in the country, an improvement that is will now be reversed. And even if we ignore all of that, the US as an occupying voice has, or at least had, more than enough sway over the region to ensure free and fair elections. &#x200B; 4. The USA needs to care for itself first and not solve other nations\u2019 problems. &#x200B; While I can understand this point of view, and in my opinion, it is the strongest argument against staying in Afghanistan, it is also an inherently selfish one. While I can understand why some nationalists believe in that, I absolutely cannot understand why so many people who at the very least claim to have a more humanistic and globalist mindset still carry this position. So many so-called \u201cleftists\u201d are busy claiming that they would rather their tax dollars went towards healthcare rather than war. Ignoring the fact that universal healthcare would be cheaper than the current American system, the West as a whole and the US have (or at least should have) a duty as advanced, rich, and democratic societies to help other, less fortunate places become better. Seeing as this is the most basic claim of almost any somewhat leftist ideological leaning has, I truly do not understand the wide support this move has among the American left. This problem is not only restricted to the left though \u2013 much of the right in America also supports abandoning Afghanistan because of nationalism, completely ignoring their claimed ideology of the protection of human rights. &#x200B; I would love it if anyone could explain to me how the US withdrawal is not evil, or at the very least, selfish.\n\nAssistant:"

Both my parents have doctorate degrees, my siblings all went to Oxbridge or American Ivy League schools. They are, for all their faults, very capable of proper reasoning. Yet on any political issue they show zero willingness to engage in reasoned debate.  This is a trend I've seen amongst other conservatives online and in person. Transgender athletes? \"Ban them. They have an advantage. Testosterone advantage. Biological males!\" Even though no data agrees with their position. Sabine Hossenfelder does a very good job at breaking down the topic but even with Thomas, who compared to the prior years winners was relatively average (and actually performed fairly average for a competitive swimmer in the event as a whole).  Healthcare? \"Privatise it!\" But why? It only sucks because the Tories have underfunded it. Privatisation has failed in America. It's a bad, expensive idea that will cost us more money than the NHS. \"But I don't want to pay for other people.\" Then leave society. That's the only way you accomplish that goal.  It truly feels like they only care about how politics affects them and their predetermined biases/feelings, even if it is an objectively bad idea.  Now, I do admit my bias. I don't think any conservative has ever provided a convincing reason for their policy positions, only an explanation for why they hold said position (this isn't the same thing.... saying \"I believe this because\" is not an argument for my belief, it does not attempt to explain why *others* should agree with me). I also do believe conservatism is a net negative on society based on their positions.\n\nAssistant:"

If you're a rich person whose made enough money to push you into the highest tax bracket, constitutionally, why should you have your money taken away at a greater *percentage* than anyone else? If anything, this seems to at least *somewhat* discourage people from wanting to earn more money. If we live in a society in which everyone has equal rights, why should we be taxed unequally? Whether or not it would work for the government, the only truly fair thing I can think of is a flat percentage that the govt takes (say, 15%). The Constitution protects certain human freedoms, but I don't think it authorizes taking proportionally a higher percentage of money from certain people just because it would give the government more money.

A person making $100,000 1. A person making $100,001   I suspect you would answer that person (1) makes more money based on the fact that you think that a person in this tax system can be \u201cpushed up into the next bracket and have your money taken away at a great percentage\u201d.   Person (1) pays $0 tax. Person (2) pays $0.50 tax not $500,000 tax. Person (2) even at a 50% **marginal** tax rate only pays tax on the margin \u2014 the money above the line of the bracket.

I don't find this argument persuasive for these reasons:  **The threat isn't effective:**  * For the argument to really work, guns must present an effective threat to the government, or at least to the politician introducing some sort of freedom restricting legislation. Just having the gun isn't enough, there must be a perception of that people are willing to use it. * Guns are a weapon of last resort. To take arms against the government means a near guarantee that you'll sacrifice your life for it. This means it only makes sense if what the government is doing is so awful that death is an acceptable risk. * To achieve success there needs to be a large amount of agreement that this is the right path. Until that, it'll simply be terrorism and opposed by the rest of the population. * In fact, the actions of the US government don't seem to be especially careful when compared to the actions of say, an European government where gun ownership is restricted. So the threat doesn't seem to be working.  **There won't be a clear point at which to resort to weapons:**  * One path a government may take is to slowly reduce freedoms, in such a way that no single reduction warrants a violent response. * The other path is to drastically reduce freedoms, at a time where the country seems to be under attack. The violent response will be prevented by patriotism.  **The results will be counterproductive:**  * By the speed with which things like the PATRIOT act and the TSA appeared it seems like there are laws and proposed organisms lying in wait for just the right incident. An attack against the government that doesn't have widespread public support will result in the swift reduction of freedoms, using the attack as the perfect excuse for it. And the public will support it. * The American public is deeply patriotic and any such attacks won't get a positive reception, even despite the people having a serious distrust and lack of faith in the government.  **The willingness to fight will be neutralized:**  * A government changing to a tyranny, unless it's completely stupid, will do so with an amount of care and will try to ensure its own success. * A slow introduction of surveillance and restrictions will be able to push back the willingness to fight and undermine any forming resistance. Already existing laws and mechanisms can be used to sabotage such efforts. * If a resistance is forming anyway, a government may make just enough concessions to avoid a revolution.  **My conclusion:**  Guns as a way of protecting against the government overstepping its bounds aren't effective until things really get out of hand. By that point, there isn't really any freedom left to protect.   CMV.  _____  > *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

My view is that when Russia demanded Viktor Bout in exchange for Brittney Griner, they were calling our bluff.

She was traveling to Russia, a country with very strict drug laws, and I would be surprised if this was the first time that she brought cannabis products into Russia, it was just the first time she got caught. Whether we agree with the laws or not, when you are in another nation you are a guest in that nation and subjected to their laws. We have to suspend our understanding of cannabis in the US and understand that in the eyes of Russia, she broke the law and must do the time.

There are wayyy too many people unable or unwilling unwilling to make the changes necessary to live sustainably off a society fundamentally based on fossil fuel energy.  It doesn't matter if you take shorter showers, go vegetarian, turn your heat down during the winter etc etc when so much of our lives outside of our own control are based on fossil fuels. The roads we drive on, the water we drink, the food we eat, the metals in our appliances, electronics,and infrastructure, the lumber that makes our homes/workspaces, all are derived or produced using fossil fuels (nevermind transportation and electricity).   There are so many people living in poverty or barely making ends meet that don't have the luxury of going to the local farmers market to \"buy local\", voluntarily paying a higher electric bill to support renwables, or biking to work instead of commuting because they can't afford to live a couple miles down the road from their office (or dont work in an office and have to drive to constantly changing job sites instead).

Governments and industry need to invest massive amounts of money into developing solar/wind plus storage solutions that are as reliable and inexpensive as natural gas.  These are the only solutions that can actually be implemented worldwide to combat carbon emissions.

This has been obvious for a while. Chanting \"Lock her up\" about Hillary -- basically saying \"Jail our enemies without any indicting charges or trial\" or the multiple hearings over Benghazi despite repeatedly finding no wrong doing, this all showed that the GOP wanted to use the machinery of the law to punish political actors.      And Trump clearly went out of his way to use the DoJ and other aspects of the justice system to try to punish his enemies, but was stymied for the most part because those in the system, even if otherwise corrupt, refused to subvert the justice system completely.   Remember, a warrant has to contain:   a) the substantiated claim of a probable crime has been committed  b) the substantiated claim that evidence of that crime probably exists  c) the substantiated claim that said evidence likely resides in a particular place at a particular time  d) the substantiated claim that there is reason to believe that the evidence can not be retrieved by the government through less aggressive means (such as subpoena)  All of which has to pass the \"sniff\" test of a federal judge.   This latest outrage shows that a huge number of GOP voters really do think that the rule of law should be abandoned. To be upset about this they have to believe that:   1) the FBI would submit a request to the DOJ for a search warrant for political payback of some slight  2) A prosecutor would back the FBI and run the warrant up the chain for approval  3) Merrick Garland -- a lifelong republican stalwart servant of the law would subvert the law to the whims of a Democratic president for some personal gain  4) A Federal Judge would sign off on a warrant out of political animus regardless of the legal merit  I get that this is unprecedented in the sense that it has never happened to a former president before. But instead of taking it for what it implies - that Trump was unprecedentedly corrupt, they embrace a further conspiracy theory?!     The GOP has honestly lost their collective minds. But this demonstrates they are literally unfit to govern anything because to be outraged by this action requires a complete and fundamental disrespect for the rule of law. In order to sustain this believe, they have to believe that literally every branch of the government is corrupt to the point that a president can force federal judges to effectuate extra-judicial searches and seizures upon ex-Presidents.      I don't get how they maintain that level of disconnect from reality. However, it does require a complete disregard for the rule of law, today, in order to maintain it.\n\nAssistant:"

For the past half century, we have been living a cultural crisis in which traditional forms of meaning-making (i.e. Church, local community, family) are being disrupted by new sources of information and meaning, like television and the internet. A five-year old today can easily Google \"is santa real?\" and with a single tap, unmask all of their family members as complicit in deceit. As they grow up with the internet, they will continue to pull the thin veil on all the sacred constructs that had been passed down from generation to generation as indisputable facts. Empty handed, with nothing to make sense of the world with, people are using new tools, bodies of knowledge, heuristics and media to construct meaningful lives for themselves. Astrology is one of such bodies of knowledge.   >However, with social media horoscopes going through a massive boom recently, I've seen a lot of people >presenting it seriously.

Facing this vacuum of meaning, I know many critical thinkers, and college-educated people who engage with astrology. The point is that they are not \"believing\" in horoscopes as an empirically verifiable phenomenon, but instead are using horoscopes as a tool that helps them create meaning in their lives, and find connection with others through shared life meanings. Astrology isn't 'believing' wholeheartedly that your fate is sealed in your stars; astrology instead provides a 'reading' of your stars that you can engage with and think about, rather than accepting wholeheartedly. It provides much needed structure in thinking about emotions, loved ones, life projects, etc. to replace the traditional sources of meaning-making of times past.   >Secondly, this undermines their points in other discussions and arguments.

Throughout recorded history people have looked to sky, tracing symbols with their fingers and creating stories about celestial bodies that are otherwise meaningless. Today we have all kinds of sensors and telescopes pointed at those same celestial bodies, gathering immense amounts of information about them. Should we cross off all of those fantastical, imaginative stories about the stars as meaningless because they do not match the information we collected about reality? No. Even if we know these stories aren't empirically true, they continue to impart meaning to us and animate our lives. Despite our increasing secularization, Christian morality is still codified in many aspects of our society, having real physical effects. So although there is no proof that astrological predictions should ever be true, astrology has empirically measurable effects on the lives of its practitioners, and to that extent it is real and believable."

As the title suggests, I believe that newly elected President Trump has a universal effect of bringing out the worst in almost everyone.  Trump was largely elected by people who were fed up with the US political system, believing that it was broken, corrupt, and was far away from its traditionally \"great roots\". His supporters (based on his campaign rhetoric) voted for him out of fear of foreign based terror attacks that were overstated by Trump and a problem of illegal immigration from Mexico (even though we're actually losing Mexican immigrants). In short, his supporters ignored facts for flashy, paranoid, bombastic campaign rhetoric.   However, the opposing party is not guilt-free either. The democratic party sees Trump as a bigot, racist, and xenophobe. Those three buzz words are everywhere. They can't understand why he was elected. On my Facebook the day after the election, people were unbelievably upset because they saw a country that was now based on hatred. However, Trump lost the popular vote, so wouldn't that mean, even if every Trump supporter was hateful, that the country \"filled with hate\" is still in the minority? That night, the number one trending topic on Facebook was about Mike Pence. Mr. Pence did once advocate for state funds for people seeking to change their sexual behavior, but never once advocated for the usage of electro-shock therapy. I support same-sex marriage, but one of my gay friends was very upset after Pence's election, because (this is true) he said that he would \"probably be going to a concentration camp\". Then he cited the fact that Pence had advocated for electro-shock therapy, which is not only untrue, but also illegal. In the same vein as Trump supporters screaming, \"Make America Great Again\", Democrats are screaming too--and the worst part is people aren't screaming anything that is supported by facts.   Perhaps the *worst* part of all is how congress has been affected by this election. The only goal of congressional democrats is seemingly to block Trump from doing any actual governing. Democrats thought it was unfair when Republicans did this after the death of Justice Scalia, and, a year later, they are doing the same thing. Regarding the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch, Sen. minority leader Chuck Schumer said that there would be exhaustive debate over his confirmation.   In short, it just seems instead of promoting facts, we're promoting opinions. We're trying to all be the loudest one in the room and not the most intelligent. Trump may have said things that have belittled muslims, women, and the disabled, but liberals, who want to be seen as elite and take the moral high ground are yelling at the same volume, and it's brought an end to civil discourse and factual support.           ____________ > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

The fact is that Pence had previously advocated for an abusive and typically unlicensed psychiatric practice that often included electroshock therapy, but did not specify which specific treatments should be funded, stopping at suggesting funding those types of therapists in general.  Electroshock therapy as a specific treatment is not illegal. Anti-gay conversion therapy is illegal in five states. And the 2016 Republican Party platform included support for \u201cthe right of parents to determine the proper treatment or therapy, for their minor children,\" which is exactly the same language used by organizations like the Family Research Council to defend conversion therapy and call for the bans in those five states to be overturned.  The world's a complicated place. Sometimes there's more nuance to a situation than the headline/slogan/what have you would imply, but not having that nuance front and center isn't grounds to dismiss an issue as entirely untrue or portray the people concerned about it as \"unsupported by facts.\"  > Democrats thought it was unfair when Republicans did this after the death of Justice Scalia, and, a year later, they are doing the same thing.

I voted for Gary Johnson in the last election because I am a Libertarian at heart. I was really hopeful he would clinch 5% but no dice. Assuming he runs again in 2020 I can't really see his numbers climbing 2% nor can I really imagine any other independent candidate having much more success.   Since the last election I have changed my registration status and am now registered democrat. I would honestly love to see voter turnout for third party candidates increase this election but this seems like a monumental election and it is 100% a democrat vs republican battle. I would lose sleep at night knowing I wasted another vote on a libertarian candidate if Trump is re elected. Especially if turnout for independents is lower this election than the last and even worse if Trump clinches the victory by a slight margin.

Most hard drugs you can\u2019t use casually, because you get withdrawal symptoms and become down after the high really easily. Granted, there\u2019s also plenty of hard drugs less addictive, but that brings me to my second point.  Hard drugs is devastating on the body and mind, much more so than alcohol. Alcohol can damage the liver with excessive use, and it can cause memory loss or korsakov syndrom. It can cause comas and all kinds of illnesses. But you have to drink a lot of alcohol to achieve these things. Meanwhile, harddrugs can get you in a very bad shape within a very short time, while using less.  Combine the addictiveness of hard drugs with its lethality, and you have a seriously dangerous cocktail (hehe). Alcohol on the other hand is much less dangerous.

My friend (I'll call him Sam for the purposes of this post) identifies as male, despite being born with female genitalia. He lived his life like that for a long time: letting everyone know they should use male pronouns when speaking to him, wearing clothing that didn't 'accentuate' the female appearance of his body, keeping a short haircut, but otherwise going to no particular effort in order to appear especially male. I would say that for a long time, he had more of a 'gender neutral' appearance.   Recently, Sam decided he would like to take it a step further. He began taking hormones. He's now asking friends for money to eventually help fund transition surgery, because his health insurance policy views it as a form of cosmetic surgery, and therefore does not cover it. He is also trying to petition the insurance company in order to get the surgery covered, not just for him, but for every transgender person who may come after him.    Personally, I think the insurance company is not wrong. I understand that there are people who experience significant distress because they feel their breasts are too small or their nose has the wrong shape. I understand that it's possible to help some of those people using surgical techniques. I am not advocating against the right to choose to have, say, breast augmentation surgery. But I agree with most insurance policies, which deem those kinds of procedures purely cosmetic, and therefore do not cover them.

I personally started transitioning in 2015 with hormones and even had a surgery to reduce the size of my adam's apple, which wasn't covered by insurance and cost me ~$8000 CAD, which I had the luck to have my very supportive parents help me with. Still, even though I only paid for half of it myself and had the help of my father for the other half, that cost impacted me financially extremely strongly and I don't think I would have been able to ever afford it if I also had to pay for rent and things like that. I was 19 when I went through with this surgery and I hadn't even started university yet, and I don't think I can describe through words impactful enough how much that surgery relieved me, and how completely and hopelessly miserable I would have been if I had to wait a few years to be financially stable enough to pay for all of it myself. It's very hard to say what the difference is between gender dysphoria and body dismorphia, but I can tell you this: while some people will go through surgery after surgery to change things about their body and still not feel satisfied, I do believe that that one surgery reduced my suffering incredibly.   Earlier this year, in 2017, I went through GRS, which is covered completely by insurance here in Qu\u00e9bec. The waiting line was short, and I only waited about a year before going \"under the knife\" so to speak. But even before so, there were many hoops to jump through. I had to meet with two different psychologists to evaluate my current suffering regarding the genitals I had, both of them agreeing that they considered that not getting GRS would be dangerous to my well being. And the funny thing is that I had plenty of doubts about it and was seeking guidance with them to help me take that decision, because I was so far down into the suffering and discomfort that having a penis and scrotum and everything that it just felt *normal* at this point, that the constant suffering and low self-esteem every time I looked in the mirror was just part of life. And I had doubts until the morning of the surgery. And I cannot accurately say how completely and utterly relieved I felt the first time I saw the result. I had fears, I had anxiety about if the decision I made was the right one, but for the first time in my life, I didn't feel disgust or pain or anxiety when I looked at myself. It has been a few months now, and the feeling of peace that was so alien to me before is just a constant now, and I am so incredibly thankful for it.   I personally think that even though the line is hard even for me to draw despite my experience between what makes gender dysphoria different from body dismorphia, I think it relates to how much relief can be gotten from the surgeries we undergo. And I think that something that's important to mention is how I, and everyone aiming for GRS, had to meet with different psychologists to get the correct recommendations. Perhaps that's what we should recommend for every drastic body modification, because sometimes, plastic surgery won't fix the suffering. And I am so thankful for it to have been covered by insurance, because carrying around the suffering I had for the years it would have taken me to finish college, have a well paying job and save money for those surgeries seems like it would have been extremely hard, and maybe I would have kept carrying my depression and suicidal ideation for all those years too. And yet that is what some people have to do, because insurance won't help them yet.   If you have questions I could answer to clarify some things, I will be happy to reply. I hope this perspective helped."

However, there are biological differences highly relevant to competitive fairness between the average male athlete and the average female athlete, and identifying as a different gender does not change this biological fact. Because of this, transgender athletes should compete in the category they were born in to maximize fairness in sports competitions.  I recognize that \"being a biological male\" does not necessitate \"being a better athlete than a biological female.\" However, rules in sporting events need to be somewhat generalized, and the fact of the matter is that in general the average male is stronger and larger than the average female.  Males have higher bone density and larger skeletal frames, which directly translate to difference capacities for competing in sports. Males, on average and at peak performance levels, are physically stronger than females and are able to accumulate more muscle mass which correlates to higher strength outputs. This also supports my main claim.  here is an example of a transgender individual (M2F) who competed in a women's weightlifting competition and won. I don't think this is a fair competition for the aforementioned reasons.

As shown by the example of the F2M athlete competing in Texas, taking prescription testosterone would allow a F2M athlete to dominate with ease; it would not be fair to allow them to compete with such an advantage.  On the other end, forcing M2F athletes to compete with men would guarantee they lose; due to testosterone suppressants, there would be little chance they could be competitive. The example given in the OP kind of proves that point; her numbers were pitiful for a male athlete, and wouldn't even get her foot in the door for competition.  Further, it seems as if your reason for allowing trans athletes not to compete in the gender they identify with is that they might win, but if you are going to set the rules up such that at least M2F athletes can never win, doesn't it make it pointless to include them? I mean, the athlete you're mentioning put up decent numbers, but she won a local competition after having been (per Wikipedia) a pretty dominant male athlete. She would have no chance of medaling in the Olympics. Is that really such a dominant performance that it would justify effectively excluding all M2F transgender athletes from serious competition?  I'm not saying the current IOC rules are perfect, but that requiring low enough testosterone for a certain amount of time seems to be a better path for M2F athletes than excluding them from competition entirely or forcing them to compete with men."

I'll make my question a little more clear. As far as I read, whenever a person is about to die, all that's happening is that their heart stops beating which in turn stops the brain's access to oxygen.  I read that it is possible to revive a dead person within 3 minutes of heart-beat-stopping as the brain usually has a 3 minute backup oxygen supply.  Why have there not been any research or investments in developing a technology like the \"defibrillator\" which revives the heart, but instead to keep the brain alive?  Also, question part 2: why does the brain die in 3 minutes? Why can't it be revived?\n\nAssistant:"

So, even if you were able to take the large machines in hospitals that replace hearts, and make it small and portable. You would still have to have emergency responders cutting open the patients neck in order to insert the tubes in the necessary vessels leading to the brain.  This would be a very dangerous and complex thing to do, even in an emergency room.  This is why chest compressions, which pump the heart by hand, are recommended for any amateurs/normal people trying to help someone with a stopped heart.

Now since we know the speed of light is constant, we can do so by bouncing a light pulse between two mirrors and counting how many times it bounces.  Every X bounces is 1 second.  Not the handiest clock, but we need it to explain the rest.  We stick this clock in a spaceship and have the spaceship fly at 3/4s the speed of light past us.  In 1 second we should still see that beam of light in the clock bounce up and down X times inside the clock.  BUT in that same time those mirrors have moved 3/4s of 1 lightsecond as well!  So through Pythagoras, in the time you in the ship see 1 second on the lightclock, I see your light pulse move a longer distance:  sqrt of (1 squared + 3/4 squared) lightseconds, which is 1.25 light seconds.  Normally this would not be a problem BUT we know from experiments that the light speed is constant.     In what I measure as 1 second on my clock, I measure as 1.25 seconds on your clock flying past.  The speed of light is constant.  That vertical distance is constant.  That means the only remaining variable, time itself must have changed.  When 1 second passes for me, I see 1.25 seconds pass for you.

The whole point of a greenhouse is to keep things from getting cold, so there's not much point.  You can grow them in a suitable patch of forest after sowing them there, but you have to wait for them to grow to maturity which takes up to a decade.

I'm going to try to Explain like I'm five years old but with a little more depth:  &#x200B;  TL;DR  * Steel can be hardened or softened * \u201cHardening\u201d involves heating, followed by rapid cooling. * \u201cAnnealing\u201d and \u201ctempering\u201d are ways of softening steel * Soft (annealed) steel deforms easily without cracking (like Play-Doh) * Hardened steel tends to crack when deformed (like glass) * You can hit Play-Doh with a chunk of glass.  You could hit a chunk of glass with Play-Doh.  But if you hit a chunk of glass with another chunk of glass, things are going to start cracking * If you hit a piece of hardened steel with another piece of hardened steel, you'll tend to crack one of them  Long version  Steel is an amazing material. Its strength and hardness can vary tremendously depending on what other materials are mixed into it (alloyed with it) and how it has been processed.  Many types of steel can have their strength and hardness adjusted simply by heating and cooling them in the right order and at the right speed. This is great because you can make the steel soft, which makes it easier to cut it, file it, grind it, etc.  When you're done working with it, you can give it a heat treatment that makes it as hard as it needs to be for the finished product.  At this point you might be wondering - how exactly do we define hardness, and why does it matter? Hardness is literally how difficult it is to put a scratch or a notch into the steel. Think of wood -- easy to dent, therefore it's not very hard.  Aluminum (like the lid of a Macbook) is also rather soft, and therefore easy to scratch or dent. Steel is rather hard, and some steels can be VERY hard.  But hardness isn't the only trait we care about with materials. Otherwise we'd just make all the steel as hard as possible, all the time.   Another important strength is toughness.  You can think of toughness sort of like opposite of brittleness. A material that's very tough can take abuse without cracking or shattering.  A very tough material can absorbe a lot of energy, say from an impact. It might bend, dent, or deform in some way, but still not crack.  Generally, with steel, toughness and hardness work against each other.  If you harden a piece of steel, it's toughness drops.  That means it's really hard to dent it or scratch a piece of hardened steel, but if you push it past the limits of its strength, it is MUCH more likely to crack. Very hard steels (like the kinds used for cutting other steels) can be so brittle that they will shatter or at least crack if you drop them on the wrong surface.  On the other hand, if you anneal the steel (soften it), it becomes much tougher, and will tend not to crack even when highly deformed.  Imagine bending up a wire coat hanger.  It's not going to crack.  Hammers have to be rather hard; otherwise the hammer's head would eventually mushroom out and become useless.  They also need to be rather tough, to avoid shattering.  So, there's a bit of a compromise.  They try to make the hammer hard enough that it's going to be harder than whatever you're likely to hit with it, but not too far beyond that.  That way, when the hammer hits a nail, the nail is more likely to deform and the hammer is unlikely to be dented, scratched or nicked by the relatively soft steel of the nail.  And hopefully its toughness is high enough that it can still take some abuse without shattering.  When you take two hammers and smack them together, you're hitting two pieces of relatively hard, relatively brittle steel against one another.  Inevitably, one of them is slightly harder than the other, so if you hit them hard enough, you're going to start deforming the softer hammer.  But it may not be able to tolerate that deformation without cracking.  If it does crack, the pieces will tend to fly off with lots of energy (both because you hit it so far and strained the metal, like a spring, and also because of any internal stresses that may exist in the metal from the heat treating process).   So there's a decent chance that you're going to send shards of steel flying.  That's the general reason why hitting hammers with hammers is a bad idea.  &#x200B;  **EDIT:**  Thanks everyone for all the upvotes and the awards!

There is a lot more situation when you car what is on that side of the car directly beside, behind, or in front compared to the other side.   Regardless of the visibility, the main reason is what is mentioned in other posts, you fit two individuals in the front row of a car.

Second, your skin responds to the removal of these oils by squeezing up and forming wrinkles.

An individual investor would call (or write, or telegraph) their local stock broker to place a trade.  The broker would first collect all the trades in-house from all their local branches to a central location (usually New York).  For big brokers (and this is still true today), many of these trades could be canceled out in-house as well (if one customer wanted to sell 1000 shares, and another one wanted to buy 500, then the net amount the broker had to go buy was only 500 shares, because they'd just swap off between their customers).   Then the brokers themselves would do the same thing feeding into the stock exchange floor (such as the most famous New York Stock Exchange).  The brokers would place their orders by phone or by wire (telegram-ish) to someone with a seat on the exchange.  Those guys would likewise first trade in-house and then contact their agents on the floor regarding any net sales remaining.  The guys inside the exchange house getting the call and wire instructions would then communicate via hand signals (and also by shouting).  Guys on the balconies would send signals to the traders on the floor.   Then, finally the guys on the floor who were agents of the different brokers would group together in little circles divided up by industry, and trade with each other, bidding up or bidding down stocks in order to complete their sales.  For example one guy might say (using special verbal codes and hand signals) \"I offer to buy 10,000 shares of US Steel for $3 per share\" and someone else would say \"I offer to sell 50,000 shares of Alcoa for $1.45 per share\".  The largest companies might even have their very own \"pit\" with a group of guys just for that one stock.  If someone else was ready to sell (or buy) at the named price, they would signal back and each broker would write down on a card who they bought or sold what to, and hand it to a \"runner\" who would take the cards back to accountants who would double-check and then record the trades back up the chain, to the traders, and the brokers and then the stockholders.  Before any computers, the time needed to transmit all these communications and double-check all the records was enormous.  This is why banks and the stock markets used to be open only for limited hours each day (e.g. from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. \"banker's hours\") because the rest of the day and night was often spent sorting out what happened the previous day and getting ready for the next day.   This is also part of the reason why the stock markets still operate in units of \"trading days\" because it was often impractical for anyone except the largest, most sophisticated brokers to try to make money by trading on within-day fluctuations in price.    Here is a video from the 1950s showing the system at that time.  Here is a video of trading in the 1970s when they started to transition to using computers for parts of the operation.  You can still see hand signals and cards being used for the floor actions."

While the Babylonians were obsessed with the number 60 and are credited with the invention of 60 minute hours and 60 sec minutes. They assumed the year was 360 days (60 x 6) which is also why there is 360 degrees in a circle, because they used degrees to track the stars.  The Romans invented the modern calendar, and the Julian Calendar was used until 1582 when Pope Gregory XIII instituted the Gregorian calendar (today's calendar) which was based on the Julian Calendar but added extra days to fix a bunch of mistakes in time keeping. But famously it didn't become standard for some time, the Russians in particular didn't adopt the Gregorian Calendar until 1918 during the founding moments of the Soviet Union. They famously showed up to the 1908 Olympics on the wrong day because they were still using the old calendar.  As for why The Gregorian calendar became the global standard, the answer is the usual... Colonization.  During the Industrial revolution accurate time became important. Prior to the invention of trains each town kept track of its own time and clocks from one town to another could be widely off. This also didn't really matter as accurate time keeping wasn't nearly as important in a medieval society. You wake up at dawn and do you work, you eat when you're hungry, take your breaks when it's appropriate, and you go to Church on Sundays. The idea of a 9 to 5 job started in the Industrial revolution.  With the arrival of trains suddenly accurate clocks were important in order to maintain the schedules. So accurate time pieces and calendars started becoming wide spread. The problem of standardizing time across Europe was actually a monumental task as it had never been done before.  Pocket chronometers (the ancestors to pocket watches) became important for ships as well because having an accurate clock is key to navigation using longitude.  These inventions were spread by the British Empire along with the Imperial Measurement system around the world.  But interestingly different countries still use different calendars and years.  Japan for example still names it's eras based on the current Emperor. This would be like saying \"Year 70 of the reign of Elizabeth II\" in England. This actually posed a problem recently as Era's aren't named until they start so when the new Emperor took over and the Era of Reiwa began there was a panic to update the computer systems and Calendars."

You could die. Thank you.  First off, remember that coffee is the roasted seed of a cherry that is pulverized in a grinder, while tea is actual dried leaves from the tea plant.  Because we can grind coffee really coarsely or super fine, we control the extraction time to get the proper strength from the coffee.  Finer grind has more surface area (i.e. espresso), and we can get all the good stuff out in under 30 seconds.  A big, coarse grind like for french press, can take 4 minutes.  As for why we don't use coffee bags regularly, it's for a couple of reasons.  Coffee stales very quickly once ground, much faster than tea.  It also has to do with 'fines'.  Because coffee is a brittle, organic seed, when it is ground, you get a range of particles from large to small.  You'd need a bag permeable enough to let the coffee steep and for water to move through it, but also not allow all of the fine particles through.  This is simple with gravity brewing like pour over or drip because the water will eventually get out.  It's not really moving if it is in a bag in a cup, so the filter would have to allow for the smaller stuff to wind up in the cup and your coffee will be 'muddy'.  This happens with french press too, and some people enjoy the body of this type of coffee for that reason.   Tea, on the other hand, more or less behaves the same, and needs to be steeped for several minutes to get the most flavor from it.  Chopping the leaves up finer helps somewhat, but it seriously affects the flavor of the tea, as breaking the leaves causes them to lose a lot of their essential oils and flavor.  If you've ever had a really nice loose leaf black tea next to, say, Liptons bagged tea, there's no comparison.  So, yes, you could mill up tea leaves small enough to make a drip machine make 'tea', but it probably wouldn't be very nice.  Your last question about cocoa - Chocolate is the most complicated process of the 3.  Cacao beans are fermented, dried, roasted, dechaffed, ground, pressed with sugar, blended with cocoa liquor....  It's a crazy process that I can't understand how we figured out it was possible in the first place.  If the roasted 'cocoa bean', or cacao nib were just ground up and steeped, it would be very bitter, and probably not to your taste, but this was basically what was drank by the ancient peoples of Mesoamerica (with added chili and spices for some fire).  Instead, we just make sweetened cocoa powder that is ground super fine, kinda water soluble and we drink the 'grinds', unlike coffee."

It is thought that spoken (and/or possibly signed) languages came about long before written language did, and so the origin of language itself is lost to history. If any records exist anymore, we don't know how to read or even recognize them.  This brings us to the story of the Nicaraguan schools for the deaf, which were founded in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They had a problem: there was no Nicaraguan sign language at the time. Most of the students just had some ad hoc systems developed at home and not much else, and these varied widely between the different students. They were trying to teach the students using spoken Spanish and a kind of improvised fingerspelling, but then something unexpected happened: the children started forming a language among themselves. The teachers couldn't understand what the children were saying, and brought in linguists from MIT to help. What they found was complex and distinct from anything the teachers were using, but very definitely a language in its own right, with its own grammatical and syntactic structures.  The linguistics community went absolutely *bonkers* over this, because it was a rare opportunity to study how a language could appear almost completely without influence from other existing languages. It doesn't necessarily parallel exactly how language evolved among prehistoric peoples, but it does represent one way that it could have happened. It is now the official sign language of Nicaragua, and it has kept on evolving at a frantic pace, with the younger generations developing whole linguistic structures that the older generations didn't use. This is probably something to do more research on if you're interested in this sort of thing."

The problem lies in the fact that since my old Psychiatrist left, my new one is now -refusing- to fill my medications that I've been on since before this Doctor came in. My old doctor left 2 months ago(He had been there for 6 months prior). Last month, this doctor had no problem filling my medication. Well, I was supposed to see him on October 6th of this month. I cannot drive, as I have physical health problems as well as mental. So, my therapist or my case manager is supposed to drive me into see the psychiatrist. No one came on the 6th to bring me to the doctor. Something about a scheduling error... Well, I ran out of medicine and called in for a refill.

Lawyers say all options look bad for me because of location. What can I do? (California). A disgruntled former employee is attempting to sue me in a class action labor lawsuit for unpaid overtime and unpaid meal breaks, but I have tons of proof that his overtime was paid as well as his paid meal breaks.  Some context, I own a small security firm in California. In early 2020, right before COVID hit, I acquired my first contract. After speaking with the owner of the facility, his only condition for bringing me on as a security provider was that I retain a security guard by the name of J. that currently worked there for another company, and asked that I bring him onboard with me once we took over as the new provider. I agreed to do so and began hiring a team of people to staff the site.  Once the site was fully staffed, J. approached me and essentially demanded that he keep the same schedule he had with the previous company, which was a 13-hour a day, 5 days a week schedule paid entirely in cash and off the books because he owed child support payments and did not want to report any income. I informed him that we couldn\u2019t do this because I would have to bill a lot of overtime to the site owner, which he wouldn\u2019t agree to pay, and that I was not comfortable paying him under the table. He became extremely upset and went to the site owner who ended up hiring him directly (illegal for armed security, must be provided by a third party contractor) and paid him in cash while I staffed and scheduled everyone else on the team. This lasted about 6 months until the site owner could no longer deal with his constant call-offs and petty complaints and asked me to hire him. I did so under the condition that he was not scheduled for more than 8 hours a day with me and that I would cover any incidental overtime, but that I would not pay him or schedule him for any additional hours unless I could bill for the overtime and have it all on the books. He agreed, I hired him, and everything was done above board on my end from that point on, although I do know that he had a side deal going on with the owner where he worked additional hours every day and was paid in cash by the owner, and I have multiple employees who can attest to this fact.  Fast forward a year later, about a year and a half after we started the contract, and this guy continues to be a nightmare. He refuses to attend any meetings, he refuses to wear our uniform, he refuses to clock in and utilize our time keeping app, he refuses to sign waivers agreeing to paid onsite meal breaks (the standard in the security industry) and is just a general nightmare with all of his fellow guards and even certain female members of the client site staff. This entire time he held the contract over our head saying that if we didn\u2019t give in to his demands, he\u2019d talk to the owner and have us replaced. He also threatened us with legal action if we fired him and said he wasn\u2019t gonna go easy, saying the same things to our site supervisor and other guards.  We eventually ended up firing him for his behavior, and almost immediately got the boot from the owner. 2 days later he filed a workers comp lawsuit after never having reported an injury to a supervisor or myself, and after calling the site supervisor and asking him to make false claims about having been injured which our site supervisor refused to do and informed us about. This claim ended up being denied by workers comp but I do know he was given a settlement. This was a year ago in August of 2021.  A few days ago I received a mailer from a local law firm regarding pending litigation against me, specifically a class action lawsuit for unpaid overtime and meal/rest breaks. I called them and spoke with an attorney who said that essentially my only options were to:  1. Settle for an enormous 6 figure amount that I don\u2019t have.  2. Pay $250,000+ to fight it out in court with no guarantee that I\u2019ll win, especially due to the fact that I\u2019m in California where a majority of cases go in favor of the employee.  3. File for bankruptcy at the age of 25 completely ruining my spotless financial history.  I\u2019m just at a loss here and don\u2019t understand what to do or how to deal with this. I only have 4 employees at the moment and have only had around 10 or 11 total since I started the company, all of whom I am on good terms with and who would not agree to be a part of any class action lawsuit and who would all attest to this mans behavior and misconduct. I make about $30k a year from my company and don\u2019t have $100,000+ laying around for a settlement or a quarter million to pay for a trial that will probably not even go in my favor. I also don\u2019t want to declare bankruptcy at this age for something I had no part in. I\u2019m a veteran, have never been sued or in any legal trouble, and this guy is just making my life a nightmare because he wants all the money he can get out of this. At most I have $4-5k to settle but anything else would be out of the question for me.  Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you.\n\nAssistant:"

Me and my classmate are both 16 while his brother is 17.   I had to stay over at their house over the weekend to complete a project that I was working on with classmate. There was no way I could go for three days without relieving myself so I just watched porn and masturbated in their bathroom. When I walked out I saw classmate's brother recording with his phone. He has the audio of me masturbating and the video shows me walking out of the bathroom so anyone seeing the video can undeniably tell that it was me in there.   I don't want that video to be seen by anyone or for him to show or send it to anyone so I told classmate's brother that I would tell authorities that he is in possession of child porn if he didn't delete the video. He said he would only delete the video if I disposed of all the Enanthate vials I have and that if I do make a report to authorities that he would tell them I have Enanthate and where I'm keeping it.   It's impossible for me to rid of the Enanthate I have. However, I don't have any prescriptions for it and I've already been convicted of possessing them before so it would probably be a worse sentencing this time around. If he does report that I have Enanthate can anyone legally get a warrant and go through my stuff to find it? Is there anything else I can do to make sure that he deletes the video but I don't have to turn in anything that I have?\n\nAssistant:"

We moved into our house last summer. It was a very hectic move with a baby on the way so we didn't immediately notice that the neighbor was parking his box trailer 4 or so feet onto our property line.   We noticed his children were frequently in our driveway (not shared, does not have a sidewalk, no easements) and were riding their scooters and physically hitting our garage as some sort of bumper. I asked them to stop and they eventually did (after about a dozen more reminders). Then we started noticing that the neighbor parks his box trailer across the property line (very evident he's doing so as there is a straight line with a difference in rock color) and as a result, is ruining our gravel. In addition, he pulls his three large garbage cans in and out through our gravel since he's blocked his gate with his trailer. We intend to landscape this area and I don't want to deal with him ruining what we put in.  Thus far, I have:  -left a note with my contact information for him (which he denied receiving although it took about 10 minutes for it to no longer be taped to their front door) asking him to contact me to discuss the property line - placed large/heavy rocks along the property line within the entirety of my side only to have him move them to a pile in the front of the area  -and finally, I've told him not to park on my property, allow his children to play in my driveway, or move his garbage cans through the gravel. I did so in person when he came over to confront me about \"making it impossible to park.\" His response was that I am a rude neighbor and that because he's been parking his trailer in that spot for roughly 3 years, he can continue to do so. I told him under no circumstances is he to use my property and has no permission to do so.  This evening I went out to see that he has moved the gravel to make it look like he's parked on his side but he's still over the property line by several feet. He also moves the large rocks and then puts them back thinking I wouldn't notice.  It may seem petty but I am so flabbergasted by his entitlement and attitude that I owe him my owned property to use free of charge and without permission. This isn't entirely relevant, but I'm a grown adult and the way in which he spoke to me was that of a grown man chastising a child.   We intend to put in large hedges but our landscaper has recommended we wait until spring.  We do have an HOA we pay for, but they don't enforce anything or respond to calls or emails and don't have a dedicated office to visit.   I don't particularly want to go nuclear on him for fear of retribution but I'm not sure how else to get it across to him that I'm serious.   What am I legally allowed to do to prevent him from continuing this?\n\nAssistant:"

He's ignoring my attempts to get a key from him so I can retrieve my belongings Hello everyone, never thought I would be in this situation, but here I am. 8 years ago I was in a rock climbing accident, and had to move from California back here to Missouri to live with family while I recovered. Long story short, I never recovered enough to travel back to California.  My son lived in my apartment in California for 8 months until the lease expired. I paid everything, because at the time he was doing me a favor, and I was expecting to return before the lease expired. Came time for the please to expire, and it was clear that I wouldn't be able to travel back, so I asked him to put my things in storage for me until I was physically able to come back. Since I wasn't there, he had to sign for the storage unit. Everything is in his name, however, I have been making the payments from my checking account since day one.  Just this past year I had to finally face facts. I might not ever be physically able to live away from family again. So, I made arrangements for my brother-in-law to fly to California, to be there at the storage unit while my things were loaded for transport by the moving company. Everything's already paid for.  I had been talking to my son quite regularly, so I had no idea it would come to this. 3 weeks ago I started texting him and calling him, letting him know that we were making plans for my brother-in-law to travel to california, to be there while my things were loaded by the moving company. I asked him if he could send me the key to the storage unit so that my brother-in-law could gain access. My son has completely ghosted me for the last 3 weeks. Ever since I started asking for the key. I have no idea what's going on. But, I just found out that he sold a van of mine that I left at his house in california. I found this out through a friend of his. My son never told me he sold the van. Now I'm wondering what else he sold. Honestly though, I don't care about the van. I just want my things out of storage. It's everything I own. An entire lifetime's worth of belongings  He's currently active duty in the Army. My question is, is there anything I can do? The storage facility already told me that if I don't have the key, my son is the only one that can give permission for them to remove the lock. In order for that to happen, he will have to go into the nearest public storage office, and fill out a form. He will also have to provide identification. Since I can't get him to respond, to send me the key, I doubt I'll be able to get him to do anything else. I'm sorry this is so long, I just don't even know what to think. Not even sure what my options here are.\n\nAssistant:"

I was dating a man for almost a year and living together when my cousin lost custody of her daughter.  I wanted to foster my younger cousin and keep her out of the foster system and my boyfriend did not want to. He gave me an ultimatum him or the baby. I chose the baby.  She is innocent and she is family. He did not leave.        We both got super attached to her and considered her our daughter.  It gets messy because he is a functional alcoholic.  Our relationship was not very stable after awhile.  I wanted to do bigger and better things and he was not improving at all.  I fixed my credit and planned on buying a house, he didn\u2019t pay taxes for years. I went to nursing school, his drinking got worse. The pattern did not get better over time. We broke up a few times and he would quit drinking for a few weeks and then ultimately start up again.  Permanent guardianship was granted to me and solely me a few years ago. I bought a house by myself last year.  I moved out and I left him behind in the house we were renting.  Our daughter loves us both very much. She calls him Dad and she calls me Mom. I was still letting him see her and take her when he has his son from a previous relationship.  He never paid me any support for her the entire time if that is relevant. I didn\u2019t care about it though, I just didn\u2019t want to interfere with their relationship.       Now, he is getting super skinny and sickly looking. He is drunk all the time.  I used to try and keep it under control when we were together. I can\u2019t monitor his every minute.  He asked me to take her on a camping trip where I knew everyone would be partying. I told him No and he flipped out on me.  I found out from her that he had been taking her to the marina most times he had her. All the adults drink there and party while kids run on the docks in life preservers.  He acts like we weren\u2019t together for six years and I don\u2019t know what is happening there.  His friends and family hate me because I was always against it and refused to go with him to the marina and on the camping trips anymore. I was the controlling bitch but I always got stuck watching all the kids while everyone else was bombed.  I asked him to stop drinking and reminded him that I\u2019m her legal guardian and he can\u2019t be drunk when he has her.        I had a friend babysitting her for me one day while I was at work. My teenage son asked for a ride somewhere and my friend told him they couldn\u2019t go because she didn\u2019t have the car seat with her for my daughter. My daughter said \u201cthat\u2019s ok. My dads friend drives me in his truck with no car seat all the time when we leave the marina.\u201d This man is known to drive drunk.

I told him when he goes to rehab we can reevaluate.  It was the last thing I wanted because I don\u2019t want to hurt her, but I genuinely fear for her safety.

If I am her legal guardian and he is not her biological father, what are the odds of him being granted these things? How do I prove his drinking problem if there is no dui ?

Remember, you only have 180 days from the time you found out about it. Tell them they need a lawful warrant to make you do anything. CPS has no power; do not agree to a drug screen or a psychological evaluation  So if you take those medical records to court, do not allow CPS to make a copy of them.  Are you married?  Did your partner also consent to letting the CPS worker and police officer in?  No?  Read this:  > The Supreme Court narrowed police search powers yesterday, ruling that officers must have a warrant to look for evidence in a couple's home unless both partners present agree to let them in.  And all this:  > Social workers (and other government employees) may be sued for deprivation of civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 if they are named in their \u2018official and individual capacity\u2019. Hafer v. Melo, (S.Ct. 1991)  > State law cannot provide immunity from suit for Federal civil rights violations. State law providing immunity from suit for child abuse investigators has no application to suits under \u00a7 1983. Wallis v. Spencer, (9th Cir. 1999)  > If the law was clearly established at the time the action occurred, a police officer is not entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity based on good faith since a reasonably competent public official should know the law governing his or her conduct. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)  > Immunity is defeated if the official took the complained of action with malicious intention to cause a deprivation of rights, or the official violated clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known. McCord v. Maggio, (5th Cir. 1991)  If I were you, I'd be on the phone to a lawyer right now, setting up a lawsuit for civil rights violation against the cop and CPS worker.  You may also want to contact the state AG."

I avoided looking in their direction and continued my work. I went into my home and made myself a sandwich and helped my son with his homework. Twenty mins later there is a knocking on the door, real erratic. I tell my son to go upstairs and I have my phone in my hand ready to call 911 cause I thought maybe a druggie was at the front door (I live in a rough area). It was the wife from next door screaming at me and calling me a perv. She threatened to sue me. I said I didn't see anything and I did not try to look in her direction. She pushed me on the chest and screamed that she would sue me for being a pervert.  When my wife got home, she was also accosted by this woman who claimed that I found her attractive (I don't) and that I was peeping (I was not; they left their windows and blinds open and made some noise). Mu wife was shocked and confused and came inside the house quickly. I explained the situation and she agreed with me that the wife next door is a crazy b-tch.   The next morning, there was a hand written note with many misspellings and typos claiming that she was going to sue me and contact my employer and tell the neighbors I am a pervert.

We were approved for the adoption and paid the fee, and received the contract stating we were now the legal owners of the cat.  On the day that we were scheduled to get the cat, the agency representative called me and said that he was waiting outside the foster place but they were refusing to give him the cat. Essentially they'd changed their mind about the adoption. He tried negotiating with them but they hung up on him and then wouldn't answer the phone (they wouldn't answer my texts when I texted them as well). We've waited several days and the agent has been unable to negotiate for the cat, even going as far as threatening to cut off the foster family from the agency (which entails cutting them off from food deliveries etc for the other foster cats, presumably they also wouldn't list the other cats that they had as well within their system). But it hasn't worked. The agency representative has been very good and has now offered to return our money, as well as comp us the fees for a future adoption.  We don't have any issues with the agency, they have been very wonderful and helpful and I can tell that they are just us frustrated and upset as we are. However, they don't seem to think there is any legal avenue to force the foster family to give up the cat (they said the police wouldn't help etc as this is a \"civil case\"). Is this definitely the case?   We wouldn't be fighting this so hard but we genuinely really liked the cat when we met him, and he seemed to get on well with us. At the moment he is still in the foster home and there were other cats there (including a feral cat). The foster home was also just a (quite crowded) apartment.   We were wondering if it is worth contacting a lawyer, or the police, or the ASPCA or anything.  Thanks for any help and advice.\n\nAssistant:"

I feel like I answered my own question with the title, but want to know if I'm being paranoid or not.  My father had an acquaintance (17 year old girl, he was a few years older) who went missing in the late 1970s. She was never found and the case has been completely unsolved since.  The other day my parents got a knock on the door, and it was a detective who asked to speak with my father. From what my dad told me, he essentially asked for all of my father's recollections about this woman. My dad told the cop everything he remembered about the woman, which isn't much, and the cop left without anything happening.  The cop did tell my dad why he paid the visit, which is apparently because one of my dad's former friends called the police station and said my dad might have information about her disappearance. This former friend is a nut and a conspiracy theorist who has an axe to grind against my dad, so we think he's just trying to screw with my dad by siccing the cops on him for no reason.

On multiple occasions, we've caught them looking into our windows with binoculars, Climbing the tree in their yard and getting as close as possible to the window in our bathroom and peaking in, they've come into our backyard which has a fence and we've caught them looking into various windows, they come into our front yard and stare into our front windows, and they've climbed into the fire escape which is a direct window to our laundry room and we've caught them taking pictures or just watching us.  We've spoken to their parents and the cops and all we've been told is that \"boys will be boys\" and that they are young and can't do any real harm. we've installed cameras and curtains. but that hasn't deterred them from trying to peek into the windows.   I need to know if there is any legal action we can take against our neighbors. The kids are all under 18 so I don't know what we can legally do.\n\nAssistant:"

Let me start by saying our uncle is around 65 and had a stroke that caused him to be on a feeding tube three years ago, but has lived with our parents for over 10 years. My sister also lives with our parents because she\u2019s currently in school. My younger brother (22) lives with my parents as well. They live in the state of Massachusetts, as do I.  This whole fiasco started about in October, where my sister left her a clean set of clothes on her bed for when she got out of the shower, and her underwear went missing while she was in the shower. She looked everywhere in her room but didn\u2019t find it, so she put another one after drying up. After getting dressed, she finds her underwear covered in semen underneath the kitchen sink. She immediately screams for my brother to come into the kitchen, where she shows him the underwear but he says it wasn\u2019t him. The only other person in the house at the time was our uncle, because the outside cameras show no cars in the driveway other than my sister\u2019s. They confront uncle about it but he says it wasn\u2019t him, so nothing comes out of it.    Fast forward a day  after that, and my sister again leaves out her clothes on her bed for after she\u2019s out of the shower. She makes sure to lock her door and brings the key with her into the bathroom, where she also locks the door. The only one in the house at that time was our uncle and our mother. Sister comes out to find her door open, and her underwear is missing. She screams for my mom who rushes to her room. Sister tells my mom what happened the day before, then tells her she\u2019s afraid it happened again. Our mother was furious, and goes to look under the sink where my sister found her underwear last time. Sure enough, there\u2019s her underwear covered in semen again.    This continues to happen once a week over the course of a month, so my sister decides to change her door and lock. This stops her clothes from going missing for about three months. So now it\u2019s  January and my sister, brother, and parents all go out for dinner with me for my birthday , but our uncle stays home because he \u201cisn\u2019t feeling well\u201d. When they return home, my sister finds two of her shirts on her bed covered in semen. She\u2019s had enough and yells at my uncle telling him to leave her alone or she\u2019ll call the police, but Uncle says it wasn\u2019t him and goes into his room. My sister decides to buy 3 EXTRA LOCKS for her door the day after for extra security, and gives her spare key to me since I live in my own house.    Ever since then it hasn\u2019t happened, but my sister is very afraid that our uncle might try and rape her. She refuses to shower at our parents house so she goes to her friends house to shower. I let her sleep over my house whenever I can, but I fear for her safety. My mother doesn\u2019t want to kick out our uncle because he can\u2019t work and needs special food packs for his feeding tube. What kind of legal action, if any, can we take? I\u2019m willing to buy a camera to catch him in the act if need be, but I am very worried for my sister\u2019s safety.\n\nAssistant:"

I made a mistake 3 years ago of buying a property in an HOA neighborhood. At the time the regulations were relaxed, but a new board has taken over and they are nuts. Last year after my neighbor cut down a tree and the HOA was mad about it, they made a new rule that to cut down a tree you must get HOA permission, and if you remove a tree without HOA permission you must pay the HOA the value of the tree. Basically they consider the tree to be a value to the whole neighborhood, not just you.   My problem is that I have a very mature tree (arborist said around 80+ years) that has been struck by lightning. I brought out an arborist to assess it and see if it could be helped, and the arborist says it cannot be saved. They said it is in dangerous condition and should be removed immediately, and if I don't get it down before it starts to drop, it will do serious damage to my property or my neighbor's.  I informed the HOA of my plan to cut down the tree. They said no - they said they need proof that it is actually dangerous.  I got a statement from the arborist who also provided a diagram of its faults.  Despite this, the HOA STILL says no - someone on the board insists he knows trees, and mine is fine, and that the arborist is just looking to make bank by referring me to someone who will give them a cut of what I pay them to cut it down.  I have gone to 4 meetings to plead my case, paid for a SECOND arborist's opinion, and have gone directly to individual board members to persuede them. Nothing has worked.  At this point the tree is such a liability I have made plans to have it removed beginning next week - I can't afford for it to come down.  But my other concern is: The HOA claims if I take it down without permission, I owe them the value of the tree. I can't pay them tens of thousand dollars just because they are unreasonable - in fact, I believe they are intentionally not giving me permission SO I will be forced to pay the money.  What now?\n\nAssistant:"

He came back to live with his mom, decided he wanted my apartment, tried bullying me out. Attacked me twice. Gaslighting me, terrorizing me for months. I got an assault charge finally and order of protection is going through this weekend. Mother's Day he came into my apartment with his mom's key, held me down, threatened my life, pushed me out. I came back a day later to my entire apartment packed up. Meth heads love menial tasks. All doors off hinges, including main door.  Cops come.

I did nothing wrong, he'll get my apartment, his mom will lose the rent she was making from me. Good riddance. It's a gorgeous, cheap studio, but not worth this level of insanity.

Once I figure out what's missing--whether it's something expensive or something priceless for sentimental reasons, like 40 camcorder tapes full of footage... what do I do?  The cop who was there, who didn't know the situation, said \"this is a civil matter\" and told me \"Hey man, my ex wife threw out all my stuff one day, and it sucks, but it happens.\" I handled it well, didn't call him a fucking idiot, just said \"Ok,\" and left with my lamp.

Also, they will only pay part of it up front, and then the rest they have to negotiate with the auto body shop. (What in the world!? What auto body shop would negotiate on price, that's absurd.)

So, I'll start off here by saying that I do have an alcohol problem. I have gone to a rehabilitation hospital, and I have a sponsor and I'm completing the steps. I've just had a few bumps along the way.   When I began my job here in downtown Chicago, I had been going through the process of moving in with my then girlfriend. Our rent is high, but we took what was available in the small town we live in.   We eventually broke up amicably, and parted ways. She however left me on the lease, and moved out. This overnight left me with an additional $600 or so in debt, at least. One thing led to another and I sought treatment but that meant missing out on work. I also was very good at my job and loved it there. So work eventually let me go, because I ran out of FMLA time. I did try and work with them, but ended up getting evicted and that really triggered my habit.   My mother had gotten a benefits package from my work when I started. (And she opened my mail.) She was listed as a beneficiary to all my disability benefits, including life insurance. So one day, she decided to start gathering documentation. She told my ex girlfriend who had moved out that she wanted me declared disabled.   The motivation on her part is monetary only. She actually has been virtually unsupportive of me and my road to recovery. (I understand this is not how things work, she can't cash out on me somehow.) But here we are.   I know she's been talking to an attorney and on my latest trip to the hospital for treatment she \"petitioned me.\" which was pretty much them putting me in a room when I asked to leave. I've talked to the social worker that night and she found no reason to keep me. Since then I've decided to go back to rehab to get better. In the meantime, I moved back in with my mom and dad. - My dad has been very supportive.   Today when helping me move, she mentioned that she wants me to \"sign contracts\" before I can stay. I also want to mention, that this isn't the first time she's done things to have me put away. I had talked to a psychiatrist about it who said my best bet is to get an order of protection.    So here I am, trying to seek help, trying to recover and I mentioned I'd like to visit the same hospital where I had gotten my inpatient and outpatient treatment. She said that \"I may not get to choose.\" and I'm going to do what my attorney said.   I am a fully functioning adult. Today, she told me I shouldn't call my sponsor to talk. My dad thought that she was right somehow and agreed. I'm not sure this is the best environment, but if I leave- there's a possibility I'll either be homeless, or somewhere that I'm far away from the opportunity to work.   What would be the best way to approach this. I don't want to burn a bridge with her, and she's done some really serious things that concern me. Example, on a hot summer night I slept in the nude. She took pictures, and sent them to my ex girlfriends. (They were not welcome.)   I'm worried about my safety. I also know with the correct support and treatment, I'll be okay. But her negativity is not something I can tolerate for long. Also, my ex girlfriend is out of state, finishing school. She's a psych major, so she knows how to support me. My mom had contacted her, and accused of her of being an enabler and even went to far as to say she gave me pills? It was regular blood pressure medication I had on the counter.   It's getting to the point with my mom where she's attempting to control me. I'm 32 years old with a very treatable problem. I know it comes off as \"a protective mom.\" but I've had different people, from police to firefighters that told me to stay away from her.   Legally, what can happen- what do I do? What would be the best approach?    &#x200B;  &#x200B;\n\nAssistant:"

Despite that, I am not your psychologist.  &#x200B;  Here is what you need to know. There are times when, due to mental health concerns, someone can have their ability to make legal/financial/health care/etc. decisions taken away from them. It sounds like you aren't that bad off and hopefully no clinician would come to the same conclusion. The problem, as you've found out, is that other people can call this into question and lie about it. t's also unusual for it to be done for substance abuse issues but all that aside, there is a clear way you can address this. You want to look into having a pre-emptive person already outlined in the case someone has concerns. These are called psychiatric advance directives. It's similar to how you can let doctors know what to do with you if you fall into a coma.  Examples of the forms for Illinois can be found here. The actual forms are not as necessary as clearly stating what you want to have happen or not happen. You can specify certain people you want to make choices for you and certain people that you do not want to make choices for you.  \"In the event that I require any sort of guardianship, power of attorney, or authorized representative to make decisions on my behalf, the following people should be appointed in this order....Under no circumstances should my mother, NAME, be appointed in any capacity. If the above people cannot serve in this function, a court appointed representative should be used in lieu of my mother.\"  Include their contact information and carry it with you. You should still argue that you do not need one in any of these circumstances because you want to make these decisions on your own but this should at least solve your worst case scenario."

[Previous post  I called the police this morning, and they came by a few hours ago. I gave them the photos I took, and they took some more photos of the cameras and the area they're recording. I'm also scheduled to talk with an attorney later this week to discuss my options.  The downside is I am not allowed to move the cameras, but the cops did let me unplug them. They told me to call them back if I find any more cameras or if these ones are plugged back in.  For the time being I'm still staying here, but I want to take a few more steps for my own security until I can move out.  In California, is it legal for a tenant to change the locks on her bedroom and bathroom if there are no provisions in the lease that prevent lock changing? Similarly, if I were to file a TRO against my landlord that prevents him from entering the property, is there any actions he can take against me before I can move out?\n\nAssistant:"

You download it, and whenever you're in a situation you don't feel safe you hold the button on the app. If you let go of the button you have to put your pin in otherwise the authorities will be notified. If you can't (such as you've become incapacitated or hurt) that's when they will be notified. They may check on you anyway even if you put your pin in.   I'm suggesting this just in case you get in a situation with your landlord and may need a little extra safety measure. It's a good idea to add your physical description info in the app (I think it's the notes section) so authorities know what you look like.   Sorry I can't help you with the cameras issue."

What programs or legal help can she get? My friend lives in North Dakota in the US, and is Native American. She does not live on a reservation though.   So, my friend (Katie) is 20 and has always had a pretty rocky relationship with her parents. She was able to move out at 18 and now shares an apartment with her boyfriend.   Unfortunately, her 16 yr old sister (Jen) has become a bit of a problem child. Their mom has kicked Jen out of the house for now. As she doesn\u2019t have anywhere to go, Katie is letting Jen stay with her in the apartment.   I\u2019m really concerned because Katie doesn\u2019t have enough money, support, or time to raise Jen. She\u2019s currently in nursing school and working close to full time. I live somewhere else, and can\u2019t help as much as I\u2019d like.   Katie is really scared to go to CPS as their family is Native American. Historically, they don\u2019t trust the government to look after their kids or help them. However, their mom isn\u2019t helping at all and refuses to take Jen back.  Are there any government programs she can reach out to for funding or organizations to help?\n\nAssistant:"
