Firstly, humans entirely lack biologically based caste differentiation mechanisms. But we do have a very high degree of specialization and division of labour and have quite a few things that have convergently evolved with similar adaptations in eusocial insects. Other than that, there are actually a lot of similarities between humans and creatures we know to be eusocial (even if we don't technically count ourselves unless you slightly relax the third requirement)     In this paper, \"The Insectan Apes\" by Bernard Crespi, he goes over a number of similarities between humans and eusocial ants as well as a few of the dissimilarities. To summarize the similarities between the two that Crespi highlighted:  1. groups with genetically and environmentally defined structures;  2. extensive divisions of labor;  3. specialization of a relatively restricted set of females for reproduction, with enhanced fertility;  4. extensive extramaternal care;  5. within-group food sharing;  6. generalized diets composed of high-nutrient-density food;  7. solicitous juveniles, but high rates of infanticide;  8. ecological dominance;  9. enhanced colonizing abilities; and  10. collective, cooperative decision-making.  he also highlighted a few key differences between eusocial ants and humans:  1. **humans do not have reproductive division of labour, instead having egalitarian reproduction** 2. individual humans have large brains 3. helper mortality is not increased in humans while it is in eusocial insects 4. helper lifespan is still long in humans, and decreased in eusocial insects  That is one paper that touches on comparing humans and insects, but it's not really much of an uncommon thing to look for similarities between humans and eusocial creatures. There's also at least a few people who look to different human groups and figure that roman catholics are probably more eusocial than the rest of us.  * Why looking for similarities between ants, honey bees, and priests can be justified  &#x200B;  hope this was interesting to read!"

Some researchers think this indicates the introduction of clothing.  Other indirect evidence of clothing is evidenced by the presence of needles in the archaeological record ~40,000 years ago.   Barber (cited by /u/rinabean) is a great source for perishable artifacts. A recent book about perishables is *The Invisible Sex* by Adovasio, Soffer and Page. They discuss the clothing worn by the so-called Venus figurines of the European Paleolithic, among other subjects.   It's interesting to note that anthropologists have identified the \"naked years\" of the human past. These years (1.2 million years ago to maybe 170,000 years ago) represent the period of time between humans losing all of their body hair and the time when we started wearing clothes."

On the one hand you talk about you not needing something practical but then go on to say you're worried about later opportunities and how serious you'll be taken.   You need to decide if it's just to follow a passion or if you're truly hoping to do more.  That said, there are a few things to consider.  There are limited job opportunities beyond teaching for those with degrees in anthropology or archaeology.  There are many corporate companies that hire anthropologists to do market research and as an archaeologists you could also end up doing CRM work.    Have you considered looking into historical archaeology? You might find some really interesting options here that combines history, archiving and the insitu fieldwork.    I am also in my 30's, I have 4 children and I'm currently on the last leg of my PhD (will be defending in the fall).  I also work full-time in a very demanding job.  I have found that due to this I am not able to devote as much time or energy to doing 'extras' like conference attendance, writing papers or even networking with other in the field.  This has absolutely hurt me as it's been a bit of a struggle to get as far as I have in the field and to be taken seriously.  At this point though I don't have any grandeur to be a 'top anthropologist' or even a professor.  What I have found is that my skills in anthropology have given me a huge boost in my current position.  However, I could have also gone straight into my field without getting more than a BA or even an MA and probably would be making more money had I not gone on to further graduate school.    tl/dr:  If you are truly doing this for your own sense of accomplishment and to follow your passion, then go for it.  If you are doing it with the hopes of getting a 'career in anthropology' (whatever that is...) then I would rethink what you're really looking for."

Of course, horticulture might not be rice paddy cultivation but it's still agriculture.  Nonetheless, he finds signs that this is a worldwide dynamic that shows up where ever you have a geographic or temporal transition between densely settled agriculture and a lower-density space that makes \"less civilized\" lifeways possible.  One space he keeps coming back to is the Eastern/Midwestern US of the 1500s and 1600s, when the post Columbian contact plagues and their associated population collapses gave the survivors plenty of elbow room to make this transition."

They understand there is a lot of sentiment from local tribes about this sort of thing. I really don\u2019t care for those in the tribes advocating for the collections of these bodies for four reasons.  1. When a body is located anywhere in california, there is 3-6 tribes disputing who\u2019s it belongs to. This alone is a waste of time. It\u2019s almost entirely speculation of which tribe the body was associated with, usually it will go to the closest tribal region. (If its found in Coastal Miwok territory, it will be deemed Coastal Miwok unless proven otherwise).   2. The borders defined are based on modern delineations for the most part. In California specifically borders changed a lot. Tribes would be constantly changing their influential spheres often merging and separating from each other making it redundant to assign the remains of a body to a certain region just based on modern delineation.  3. There was so much information about native american history that has been destroyed or misinformed. I have a real pet-peeve when I go into information museums, put on by local tribe members, who don\u2019t have accurate information. For example when I go into the Maidu historic center, I should  be seeing the unique culture and history of the Maidu, not the highly stereotyped horse riding plain indians, and accompanied by headdresses. While those features are interesting to place them in the context of California Natives is incorrect and disrespectful to other Tribes identity. In short, scientists really help shape what knowledge we know. Not all Indians made acorn pancakes, some had rich culture in diving for abalone shells. Some avoided the mountains due to greater predators. All very unique identities that many tribal members ignore.   4. When the research has been done, in almost every case, researchers have been willing to return remains in mostly enact and respected conditions. If there is a truly unique case, where the remains need to be preserved or presented in a museum, the tribe should be in full support of the academic community.  These litigations of who has the right to the remains it really disrupting for a lot of people. If a body is found on a construction site that could be the remains of a tribe, there has to be an anthropologist,  a tribal representative, lawyers, construction managers, police investigators, and all the work, excavation, and removal of the body, are all postponed and can cause a a lot of short tempers in the summer heat.  It is only a few loud tribal members who are so against the academic collection of remains who make it difficult. A lot of people of the community don\u2019t have an opinion to chime in."

                "content": " i've done all three environments and all of the below are nothing concrete but more of a general description of what you will commonly find in a \"standard\" restaurant/bakery/hotel. the descriptions below rely on the fact that these operations are creating pastries from 90-100% scratch. typically you will find this more common in higher end operations. there are exceptions to the rule. my advise is to try and find out how much they make from scratch before agreeing to the position.  the biggest question you need to ask is what type of pastries do you want to make? what type of schedule are you willing to put up with?  restaurant: you have a set menu that you will have to replenish the ingredients for on an ongoing basis. this basically means making the same items day in and out. you build a routine fairly quickly once you get used to the menu. as soon as you come in, the first thing you do is check your inventory and make a list of what you need to make. during service you make the plated desserts. this description changes depending on how high end you go up the restaurant profile. the higher end places tend to change their menu on a regular basis giving you a wider scope of creativity and exposure to ingredients and desserts.  * pros: practice plated desserts, express creativity with plated desserts and flavor profiles * cons: mundane routine each day * schedule: lunch and dinner shifts * pastries: largely depends on the type of restaurant. can make several components to complete a composed dish. example, baked good (brownie), sauce (creme anglaise), garnish (raspberry sugar tuile).  bakery: similar to the above in that you have a set menu. will be routine as each morning you will make the same set menu. it is the opposite, however, in terms of when you replenish your items. unlike a restaurant where you replenish items at the beginning of the shift and make the desserts towards the mid/end of shift, in a bakery you will bake the morning goods at the start of the day and replenish low items after the bake.  * pros: possibly learn breads, quiet mornings at work, no traffic, tons of experience with baking allows you to really hone in your baking skills * cons: circadium rhythm gets pretty jacked up, can be mundane unless the bakery has a rotating menu. * schedule: early morning AM shift. example, go in at 3a or 4a and leave at 12p or 1p * pastries: mostly baked goods. example: pies, breads, scones, brownies, cookies, etc.  hotel: this is a combination of the two above. in addition you have room service and banquets to cater to. this is the most complex job of all 3. your chef will conduct an orchestra of pastry cooks depending on what is going on in the hotel. i worked at the Four Seasons hotel and the way my chef had the shifts split up was *early* morning is the AM baker. day shifts are production for the entire hotel (excluding the restaurant). this composed of taking care of all needed pastries for banquets and room service (IRD aka in-room-dining) as well as sometimes helping the AM baker with any replenishing. evening shift composed of a combination of banquet, IRD, and restaurant. even shift's main focus was the dine in restaurant while delivering any banquet desserts. some banquets required attendants so we had a designated pastry cook assembling and/or serving desserts at a walk up buffet table. not all hotels are setup the same way. it just all depends on the volume the hotel has. If for example, you end up in a Las Vegas hotel where volumes are crazy, the pastry department will be broken down into specialty groups so you won't have the same exposure I describe here.  * pros: most exposure to a wider range of desserts, most scheduling choices * cons: super high paced, constant interruptions, very complex setup * schedule: flexible, ranging from early AM baker, day or evening shifts * pastries: widest range of pastry and exposure due to the large range of services provided  you mentioned that the job was hard. big news, the kitchen industry is not an easy place to work. it is very physically and mentally demanding. not sure what you mean by \"it's really hard\" but if you are looking for a breather in between some desserts then you've entered the wrong industry. to be successful in this industry you need to work hard. raise your standards and aim for the best product. never cut corners and make shortcuts. you get what you put into the career. making lousy, sloppy desserts is NOT an option. strive for perfection. question everything. never stop learning. these are the ethics you need to engrain in your work habits to be successful in this career."

The symptoms with these can be racing heartbeat, profuse sweating, tingling to fingers and toes, feeling of loss of control, nausea, dizziness, etc. They can feel like they last an eternity although most are only a few minutes and the nausea can persist for a while after. This is what it sounds like, and can be caused by stressful situations or a number of physical maladies as well (although this is less likely). Low blood sugar, hypothyroidism, etc can cause it.   Some people mention vasovagal response. This, in my opinion, is a possibility but less likely. In those situations, most get lightheaded, have narrowed vision, can get dizzy but this isn't the predominate symptom, and feel they are going to (or do) black out. This can happen with physical injuries, which is why I still consider it a possibility. If you happened to hit the foot or in some people cases were thinking intently about the injury, it could cause a vasovagal response.   Other possibilities are causes of vertigo; migraine, abrupt position changes, infection; etc. This seems less likely.   In the end, it's hard to tell what exactly it is.

At home, I noticed the same thing. Normally, if I look at her and smile she smiles back. But it looked like she was looking right past me. Along with that, she was not tracking objects with her eyes.  I took her to the pediatrician on Friday who was concerned and wanted her to see an ophthalmologist right away. So we did that, she had a full eye exam with her eyes dilated and there was nothing wrong (like far sightedness or strabismus etc) with her eyes. The ophthalmologist was concerned too and called a neurologist who wanted us to go to the ER so we could be admitted into neurology over the weekend.  The ER did a lot of blood work, a spinal tap for fluid (I can\u2019t remember the name- I\u2019m sorry.) and the doctors there just generally said they were stumped.  We are on day 2 of being in the pediatric neurology unit. She\u2019s having an EEG done for 24 hours and hopefully an MRI today. The neurologist says he\u2019s fairly confident she isn\u2019t having seizures but wants to cover everything.  I hope one or both of those things gives us an answer but in the mean time all I have to do is think. What could possibly have caused this loss of vision seemingly overnight? She responds to sounds but not objects. She\u2019s had hundreds of lights (from nurses doctors etc) flashed right in her eyes and she does nothing like you\u2019d expect. They shined a light in my eyes to show me how abnormal it was that she did nothing because I instinctively moved my eyes.  Also... no falls, no high fevers, no recent illness, her birth was normal, she\u2019s developmentally normal.  Does anyone have any idea of what this could be?\n\nAssistant:"

It is hard to know the cause without all the test results at the current time, especially the MRI, as this seems to be something less common. If she looks well in other aspects (except for the vision loss), and has already been evaluated by a pediatrician, ophthalmologist, and a pediatric neurologist, you are doing everything you can, and it seems that everything necessary is being done. Vision requires normal eyes, normal optic nerves connecting the eyes to the brain, and normal function of the visual cortex of the brain, and of course normal response to vision requires good function of the rest of the brain. Generally most problems affecting the eyes affect only one eye at a time, and can be seen by the ophthalmologist (either anterior chamber problems such as cataracts or posterior chamber issues such as retinoblastoma). Problems affecting the optic nerves (e.g optic neuritis) are more often seen in older kids (e.g with multiple sclerosis) and are very rare at 15 months. Rarely, there can be problems near where the optic nerves come together just behind the eyes (optic chiasma) when masses (eg. craniopharyngioma)/cysts push on them and can cause visual loss. It is also rare for things to affect the visual cortex of the brain. I suspect that the MRI will be of help. If it does find something, it might need other specialists (e.g. neurosurgeon) to provide further information on management."

She lives with her husband of thirty years. I don\u2019t know her very well, but with increasing frequency she is turning up at my house at night, highly distressed. She is carrying belongings, asking to move in, trying to get in the door, claiming she is frightened and is trying to escape... With this pandemic I\u2019m not able to invite her in to calm her down, and I don\u2019t want her to wander off in that state and get lost/in trouble/exposed to covid because she\u2019s not aware of the risks (one time she was waiting for a bus). The first time this happened I took her claims of a stranger in her house at face value, and called the police. Now I am aware of what\u2019s going on, I\u2019d like to be better equipped to help.     I recognise this issue is not mine to solve - her husband needs to be able to make the home secure, and look to ongoing support - but I am looking for help in how to talk to someone in that state to not make them more distressed or confused, and how to encourage them home. Do you go along with the narrative (previously an aggressive lodger, a student that won\u2019t leave, a boyfriend that isn\u2019t working out) or do you correct it? Do you do neither and deflect the conversation? I had to look after a neighbour with vascular dementia before, and he\u2019d get confused and upset, but nothing like the roiling fear this lady gets.     Many thanks for any advice you could give.\n\nAssistant:"

If one of the people I work with come up to me, smiling or in tears, I will always smile at them, use positive words, and tell them it's going to be Okey and I will help them to be safe.  Another thing, which is hard considering Corona, is to get along in their story. Imagine being really confused of what you need to do or where you are and you come up with something (eg. At least I know I need to go to this house) and you get told that even that one thing you know isnt true. That's very frightening. So I'd find a solution to show your neighbor that they did go to a safe place and you are able to help them to some extent. You could just talk to your neighbor while you call her husband on the phone or something like that. Of course idk what your exact situation is.

Also, I talk about suicide here, so if that does you no good, please don't read. Lastly, I'm from the UK, if that matters.  This is an issue that has taken centre stage in my life for the last 5 or so years. I find that randomly, I start to smell. Sometimes like urine, other times like feces and sometimes it resembles the smell of a bin on a very hot day. After doing some research at like 16 years old I was overwhelmed by the stories of people who'd suffered something similar. There were only a handful of medical terms for diseases discussed by them, and I feel as if I fit into none of them. After being rocked with such confusion, and after feeling so damn helpless, I just told myself it was in my head and instead, I consciously distanced myself from everyone. Friends would randomly ask \"did you fart?\" and \"is there a bin around?\" when it flared up, but they didn't completely abandon me, even though I'm sure they realised I was the one smelling. Even as naive as I was and as emotionally underdeveloped I was at 16, I couldn't help but hate myself. In under a 5 month span, I went from a very happy kid with a very healthy social life to whatever beast I am now.  Since then, it's only got worse. I was still telling myself it was in my head, though, as reality was just too scary for me. Now, I feel as though I smell terribly for the majority of the day. It's gotten to a point to where I can tell that my family don't want to be near me. Really, that, with the fact that I will be starting university soon, has made me realise that I must face this head on. After 6 years of losing connection and living like a zombie, I'm ready to hear of what I could be suffering from.  This problem has been the root of essentially all the problems I've faced since I was 15.  From the anxiety, to the suicidal ideation, to the depression and even how awkward I've become. Some nights I find myself wandering of what could've been had I not had this problem, and other nights I think of very violent ways to go out. It's something that I've never wanted to admit was even real, but there's no doubt in my mind that it is real now. What still scares me, though, is the prospect of having to live with this for a long time pushing me to do something stupid. I just can't picture myself living like this for much longer, and to be frank, I think that ending it all is one very plausible conclusion for me.  Some things I've realised js that certain foods makes it flare up worse, and those foods are all either gassy or sugary. Still, though, it feels like no foods are fool-proof. I'm not sure why, but I feel as if it's linked in one way or another to my IBS.   If you're finding it hard to follow my ramblings, I'm sorry. I'm not doing very well mentally right now and it seems like it's having an effect on my ability to write.  Now, what I want to ask is if you guys know of anything I could be suffering from? If so, do you know of how I could get treatment? If not, how do I go about getting any form of help, especially during a pandemic? I feel as this is life or death for me, and I genuinely want to keep living.  Please let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on anything or if you know of any alternative options beside the ones mentioned above.   If you've taken your time to read through all of this, I appreciate it. It feels like a massive weight has been lifted from my shoulders.\n\nAssistant:"

It is a very stigmatising issue and I understand your reluctance to seek help    I\u2019ll say as a GP it would not be a common reason for people to consult and might be tricky to investigate. I suspect it might need a bit of trial and error of possible treatments, assuming that initial examination and bloods would not flag an obvious cause in a otherwise healthy person.   This might sound gross but I would want to see a patient with this problem in person when they\u2019re problem is flaring up so I could smell them. That is the only way I would be able to make sense of what the smell is and where it is coming from. (This will be tricky in the pandemic). This is to avoid misunderstanding over whether it is subjective or one or a variety of metabolic problems.   Unfortunately for some patients, what may have started as a minor issue results in their becoming highly attuned to odours which may not always be perceived by others.  It is important you speak to your GP about this and be honest about how it is affecting your mental health. It sounds like you need support for that too whilst further assessment of your body odour issue takes place.   In the meantime, is there a family member you can trust to be honest with you when you are worrying about your BO, who can tell you straight whether they are aware of something? That may help you clarify what others can smell and when, to perhaps make some sense of it.   Ironically, aggressive cleaning can make matters worse for some people as it alters the bacteria on the skin, so I suggest use a mild soap/shower gel. There are some suggestions for a particular condition on the link below. (This is not my diagnosis btw). You may also consider trying a crystal deodorant which prevents bacterial growth (Pitrok).

Need advice on how to help her. This one is a bit long, but please bear with me, I wanted to make sure I don't miss any important information that might be insightful.  About 8 years ago I became friends with a lady who told me she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis after she had a fainting episode and then partially lost her vision temporarily, she went to the ER and following medical diagnostics (MRI, tests) was diagnosed with MS. In the next few years she'd share with me her progress/MRI results as she would experience periods of recovery and then relapses/flare-ups. At that time she was very physically active, doing biking events for MS awareness and such. About 4 years ago she began living with my family (to save money on college etc) so at that time I would be able to see her every day; while she'd occasionally have periods of fatigue and difficulty walking, barely noticeable tremors, there was never an occasion that we'd need to help her move/go up the stairs. All this time time she was on MS medications, sometimes switching from one to another, changing dose, etc. Cut to spring of 2020, up until this time she still kept being very physically active, doing workouts/light weight training almost every day at home. She started being unhappy with some of the side effects of her MS medicines (some made her heart beat very fast, some made her face flush red), and I suspect somewhere around this time is when she stopped taking her meds. By summer 2020 I started noticing her tremors became almost always present instead of only occasional, and she started having occasional difficulty walking. By the beginning of fall 2020 those symptoms worsened, we'd almost always help her unload her groceries from her car and bring them home. She could only occasionally do physical exercise. By the end of fall and up until now she could no longer walk without support and would often fall (2-3 times a week). She works from home due to the COVID-19 measures so that works out well, but she almost never leaves the house, has groceries delivered, and sometimes needs help having food brought to her room in order to not spill things because of her tremors.      Now for the CLD part. At one point, I believe in the spring of 2020, she visited an OBGYN and shared her frustration with MS, he suggested she check if she might have Lyme disease. She went ahead and researched online, brought it up with the doctor that was treating her MS, was told that she didn't have Lyme (they may or may not have done the test for that back when she was diagnosed with MS, her retelling of it was confusing, but she believes the test they did had evidence of some infection and the doctors didn't report on it, instead calling it MS. I'm inclined to think they did do the test since we're in an endemic area and it came back negative, but I don't know this for sure). She kept on researching online and discovered the CLD community and what I can only tell is an aggregation of misinformation and faulty research that claims some big pharma and CDC conspiracies about Lyme disease. Reason I know this is she told me about it and also asked me questions about how CDC and FDA operates and what it means if a test is FDA-approved/CDC-recommended (I work in the biotech field and happened to be working on a EUA submission for a test, so had a bit of insight) and most importantly what it means when a test is NOT endorsed by CDC and not FDA approved. Cut to the chase, she went ahead and ordered an IGeneX test for Lyme and co-infections and got a positive result. I looked into the test and found my own concerns with it (56% false positive rate being the biggest one), but since I'm not a doctor I told her to bring the test to one and figure out how to go from there. I don't think she ever went to one, or at least not one that's not \"Lyme literate\" as I found out the term.  I looked into it and as far as I can tell the CLD isn't a recognized diagnosis and people are self-diagnosing themselves with it because doctors can't find what's wrong with them. At one point she claimed she saw \"worms\" in her stool that looked like \"spirochetes\", which, having worked on leptospirosis, obviously baffled me since AFAIK we don't have a microscope in the house, and when I pointed it out she claimed that it was a \"biofilm.\" When I asked how she could tell that she said she saw pictures on the internet. In general, whenever the conversation got to this subject and I would ask legitimate questions about the claims she made she'd turn rather defensive so I decided to avoid asking any more questions.      What worries me is now she wants to go from harmless alternative treatments (scrubbing herself with a loofah before a bath to detox the surface of the skin, taking daily 2 hour salt baths to detox the skin/body, eating garlic to kill bacteria in her blood, taking herbs, vegetarian/vegan diets, drinking crazy amounts of water that send her to the bathroom every 30 mins) to potentially dangerous stuff like long-term intravenous antibiotics. She is only 28, underweight, can't walk without support, I had to lift her off the floor the other day because she fell while getting out of a bath and couldn't get up. I fear she might die, but I realize that if she's in what honestly seems like a cult, no matter what evidence I bring to her I'll get the backfire effect. She doesn't have any relatives in the US and I told her I will help her in any way I can but I cannot support and agree to what as far as I can tell is dangerous misinformation that's making her sicker every day.      I would very much appreciate any and all advice on how to help her. Thank you.\n\nAssistant:"

I was in grad school at the time and was actually working on tick borne disease related projects which might be the only reason why I didn\u2019t end up drinking the kool aid so to speak, but I could see why someone might. Especially if they don\u2019t have a strong background in the sciences.   In my case, it did turn out that I had Lyme disease, but seeing a \u201cLyme Literate\u201d doctor really threw me through a loop. Despite being a board certified ID specialist and a graduate of a reputable school, this Doctor was characteristically odd. She was insanely disorganized, asked very leading questions, and connected several things in my medical history that likely had nothing to do with each other. Upon walking out of her exam room, I had a diagnosis of Lyme disease (from a prior test ordered by my PC), as well as likely bartonellosis, Epstein Barr reactivation, mold sensitivity, a three month prescription for ceftin, and an order for a spinal tap.   I was then invited to a Lyme disease support group meeting run by the doctor that started shortly after my appointment in which several other \u201cchronic Lyme\u201d sufferers lamented about their vague health issues and spouted medical jargon ridden nonsense they read on the Internet that maybe could seem to make sense if you didn\u2019t know anything about infectious disease or medicine. To my surprise the doctor reaffirmed almost all of this.  I walked out of that doctors office in shock and called my PC the next day for a referral to another ID specialist for a second opinion on things as I was pretty terrified to get the spinal tap done. I was seen later that week and had a lot more blood tests run that came back negative. I was told to take a fraction of the prescription the \u201cLyme literate\u201d doctor prescribed to me and that the spinal tap was completely unnecessary. I finished my prescription and have been relatively healthy since.  There\u2019s a lot of misinformation out there and a lot of people who desperately want an end all be all cure for their ailments. There\u2019s also unfortunately a lot of doctors out there that will see dollar signs in place of their patient\u2019s vulnerable states. You certainly have a right to be concerned."

This was the time of the great vowel shift, when many of the vowels were pronounced differently. Before and during this process, the language didn't sound like now, and there would be some issues of comprehension. As a written language though, it's mostly the same as now. From the Second Quarto of *Hamlet*:  > To be, or not to be, that is the question, >  > Whether tis nobler in the minde to \u017fuffer >  > The \u017flings and arrowes of outragious fortune, >  > Or to take Armes again in a sea of troubles, >  > And by oppo\u017fing, end them, to die to sleepe >  > No more, and by a sleepe, to \u017fay we end >  > The hart-ache, and the thou\u017fand naturall \u017fhocks >  > That flesh is heire to;  Still, it would be the same language, so you'd get by if you all spoke slowly. You'd have to go back to before the Norman Invasion of 1066 to encounter a completely different language. It would sound like gibberish, as would your English to them. Here are the first few lines of *Beowulf*: >  > Hw\u00e6t! We Gar-Dena   in gear-dagum >  > \u00feeod-cyninga,   \u00ferym gefrunon, >  > hu \u00f0a \u00e6\u00feelingas   ellen fremedon! >  > Oft Scyld Scefing   scea\u00feena \u00fereatum >  > monegum m\u00e6g\u00feum   meodo-setla ofteah; >  > egsode eorl[as]   sy\u00f0\u00f0an \u00e6rest wear\u00f0 >  > feasceaft funden;   he \u00fe\u00e6s frofre gebad, >  > weox under wolcnum,   weor\u00f0-myndum \u00feah, >  > o\u00f0\u00e6t him \u00e6ghwylc   \u00feara ymb-sittendra >  > ofer hron-rade   hyran scolde, >  > gomban gyldan.   \u00de\u00e6t w\u00e6s god cyning!  In between, there's the period of Middle English, which is Old English morphing with French to eventually form Modern English. Unlike Old or Modern English, there was no official version of this, because the government elite spoke and wrote in French (or Anglo-Norman, to be precise). We have literary sources, however, of which the most famous is Chaucer's *Canterbury Tales*. The vocabulary is very different, but it's still easily recognisable as English:  > WHAN that Aprille with his shoures soote >  > The droghte of Marche hath perced to the roote,\t >  > And bathed every veyne in swich licour,\t >  > Of which vertu engendred is the flour;\t >  > Whan Zephirus eek with his swete breeth\t         >  > Inspired hath in every holt and heeth\t >  > The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne\t >  > Hath in the Ram his halfe cours y-ronne, \t >  > And smale fowles maken melodye,\t >  > That slepen al the night with open ye,\t         >  > So priketh hem nature in hir corages: \t >  > Than longen folk to goon on pilgrimages,  Source: *A History of the English Language*, edited by Richard Hogg, David Denison  Edit: forgot to give an answer to the question: You could talk to Shakespeare easily, though both of you would think the other sounded weird. With Chaucer, it would have to be slow and with a lot of misunderstandings, maybe like an Italian and a Spaniard talking today. With whoever wrote Beowulf: That would be like Amy Adams talking to the spaghetti monster in *Arrival*.  Edit2: The word 'weird' is a Shakespearian innovation, from the three witches of *Macbeth*, and it comes from the Anglo-Saxon *wyrd*, which means faith or destiny."

                "content": " Sure, yes. The first party system was starting to form in 1792\u201393, during his first term as president. He was very cognizant of this. Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, two leaders of opposite parties, were famously rival forces within Washington's cabinet.   Washington professed to despise parties or factionalism. He wrote to Jefferson in 1792:  > \"How unfortunate, and how much is it to be regretted then, that whilst we are encompassed on all sides with avowed enemies and insidious friends, that internal dissentions should be harrowing and tearing our vitals. The last, to me, is the most serious\u2014the most alarming\u2014and the most afflicting of the two. And without more charity for the opinions and acts of one another in Governmental matters, or some more infalible criterion by which the truth of speculative opinions, before they have undergone the test of experience, are to be forejudged than has yet fallen to the lot of fallibility, I believe it will be difficult, if not impracticable, to manage the Reins of Government or to keep the parts of it together: for if, instead of laying our shoulders to the machine after measures are decided on, one pulls this way and another that, before the utility of the thing is fairly tried, it must inevitably be torn asunder\u2014And, in my opinion the fairest prospect of happiness and prosperity that ever was presented to man, will be lost\u2014perhaps for ever!\"  > My earnest wish, and my fondest hope therefore is, that instead of wounding suspicions, and irritable charges, there may be liberal allowances\u2014mutual forbearances-and temporising yieldings on all sides. Under the exercise of these, matters will go on smoothly, and, if possible, more prosperously. Without them every thing must rub, the wheels of Government will clog\u2014our enemies will triumph\u2014and by throwing their weight into the disaffected Scale, may accomplish the Ruin of the goodly fabric we have been erecting.  Three days later, Washington wrote a very similar letter to Hamilton that echoed some of the sentiments and language of the letter to Jefferson:  > How unfortunate would it be, if a fabric so goodly\u2014erected under so many Providential circumstances\u2014and in its first stages, having acquired such respectibility, should, from diversity of Sentiments, or internal obstructions to some of the acts of Government (for I cannot prevail on myself to believe that these measures are, as yet, the deliberate acts of a determined party) should be harrowing our vitals in such a manner as to have brought us to the verge of dissolution. Melancholy thought! But one, at the same time that it shows the consequences of diversified opinions, when pushed with too much tenacity; exhibits evidence also of the necessity of accommodation; and of the propriety of adopting such healing measures as will restore harmony to the discordant members of the Union, & the governing powers of it.  By 1795, as partisanship grew increasingly intense, Washington again lamented parties in a letter to Timothy Pickering.  > But (much indeed to be regretted!) party disputes are now carried to that length, and truth is so enveloped in mist, and false representation that it is extremely difficult to know through what channel to seek it. This difficulty to one, who is of no party, & whose sole wish is to pursue, with undeviating steps a path which would lead this Country to respectability, wealth & happiness is exceedingly to be lamented.  Washington may have disliked the idea of factionalism, but in most ways he governed as a Federalist. In fact, most historians consider him a Federalist. During the 1790s, there were no formal party mechanisms. People didn't register as Federalists. Instead, belonging in a \"party\" was defined by behavior and identity.   To be sure, Washington resisted the label of being a \"Federalist.\" Indeed, many Federalists of the time attempted to describe their rivals, the Republicans, as a self-interested party while claiming that they alone represented the true interest of society. In this schema, there was one group (Federalists) acting in the interests of the nation, and a party (the Republicans) acting out of self-interest. Through this rhetorical move, they could claim to be opposed to partisanship even as they acted very much like partisans. I don't know if Washington ever used this same rhetoric. It doesn't really sound like him. But I wouldn't be surprised if he was somewhat sympathetic to the ideas."

By 1907 it was replaced ostensibly over its poor performance in the war with Spain. Was this true or an exaggeration in order to replace the Krag with an American design? The US Army adopted the Krag-Jorgensen in 1892 after holding a competition in which it beat out several other domestic and foreign designs (including several entered by Mauser.)After the competition, two US designers sued the US government over the selection forcing a review of the testing. Once again the Krag won the competition and was confirmed as the selection.   Fast forward to 1898 and the American operation to capture the city of Santiago de Cuba from its Spanish defenders. The outnumbered Spanish were dug in and well fortified on the high ground outside of the city. Most famously atop San Juan and Kettle Hill. The US Army took the Spanish positions following a frontal assault and suffered high casualties.   An Army board of investigation concluded that the high casualties were the result of the Spanish Mauser rifles being far superior to the Krag-Jorgensens carried by US soldiers. While most of the regular US soldiers were armed with Krags many were not. Indeed, the *Buffalo Soldiers* of the all-Black 10th Cavalry (who led the charge up Kettle Hill) appear to have been armed with antiquated black-powder, single shot Trapdoor Springfield rifles. The American artillery was similarly inferior to the more modern cannons employed by the Spanish.   Considering the inferiority of other weapons in American use during the war, the direct assault uphill on an entrenched enemy and the notoriously political (and at times blatantly corrupt) nature of weapons procurement contracts during that era, was the Krag scapegoated in order to get it replaced? While the 1893 Mauser was superior to the Krag, I doubt the difference was so great as to necessitate the cost of replacement after so recently having adopted it. Not to mention the Mausers used by the Spanish (or a closely related design) was entered into the contest by Mauser and lost out to the Krag. The design was good enough that the Norwegian and Danish Armed Forces (with necessary updates over time) continued to use them as their standard issue rifles through the end of WWII. Although they would likely have less resources to replace the rifles than the US Army did, this was still 60+ years since its first adoption by the Danes in 1889.  **So, was the American Krag as outclassed by the Spanish Mausers as is commonly claimed or was its downfall a politically motivated attempt to get a domestic made replacement by people that never wanted it adopted in the first place?**\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " Although I can't speak for the exact motivations of the Ordnance Department, I can say that the Krag absolutely was an obsolescent design that warranted replacement for a variety of reasons. The magazine design precluded the use of speed loading devices, the design was complicated and expensive to manufacture, and, most critically, it had a comparatively weak bolt with a single locking block. That last point played in pretty critically with the ammunition. 30-40 Krag was an obsolescent cartridge even for the time, barely reaching 2,000 fps with ammunition at the time - even with the long barrels the infantry rifles were using. Compare this to the 7x57mm Mauser, which was pushing a bullet around 2500 fps, resulting in a much flatter trajectory that had a lot of practical impact when it came to shooting at more distant targets. Although 7x57 Mauser had a lighter bullet, such velocities weren't impossible with heavier bullets, with Spitzer-bullet 8mm Mauser coming in at around 2700 fps.  So the Ordnance Department tried to fix this by developing \"hotter\" loads for 30-40 Krag. The cartridge was capable of it - trials would push the round to 2300 fps, though not on the Krag. That's because of the inherent failings of the Krag's design. The single locking block on the bolt made it inadequate for the kinds of pressures that would be produced by the cartridge the Ordnance Department was looking at. The 30-03 cartridge that would result from these trials would get a 220 grain bullet going 2200 fps at pressures the Krag was never going to be able to handle.  From there, further failings made the adoption of a new rifle seem more reasonable. The 30-40 Krag also suffered from issues with the large rims of the cartridge, which complicated loading and could lead to malfunctions due to rimlock. There existed methods to avoid rimlock (see the Mosin), but adoption of a rimless cartridge avoids those issues entirely and ends up being simpler. And while redesigning the Krag to handle a rimless cartridge would largely be a question of replacing the bolt, with the gun itself proving itself unable to handle the pressures produced by the kind of cartridge the Army wanted, we have yet another reason to go against the Krag.  Finally, there's the magazine. The Krag's magazine was a problem for a variety of reasons. Even if we ignore its unique shape, the inability to handle speed-loading devices was a major shortcoming. Army experiments leading up to the 1903 also reveal other concerns, primarily over magazine durability. This is actually an issue not exclusive to the Krag. The Ordnance department (as with many other armies all over the world) had concerns over protruding magazines being easily damaged, so they were looking for a system that was flush fit. And with the Spanish Model 1893 Mausers as a nice good example, they had a system that did everything they were looking for. The magazine was significantly simpler and more compact than that of the Krag while also being able to accept stripper clips.  &#x200B;  All that being said, you bring up valid points, and it's not exactly out of character for the Ordnance Department to make nonsensical decisions with poor reasoning. In this case, however, we have similar instances to show that these decisions have a decent chance of being made in good faith. The British had a similar experience in the Boer War, where they felt outclassed by the flatter-shooting 7mm Mauser cartridge - in their case developing a standardized \"short\" rifle and adding a charger guide to address their biggest complaints during the war. Germany's adoption of the Gewehr 98 offers a similar situation with the replacement of a recently adopted but sub-par rifle. The American experience here seems to be a mix of both of these situations - the Krag was recognized as being underperforming in the Spanish-American War, but the Ordnance Department determined a new design was more conducive to their new requirements than their existing rifles."

I work at a nonprofit organization in Texas doing fundraising and donor relationship management among other things. We don't really have a HR department. I'm new to the field, and it's kind of a dream job (or at least a step on the way to a better dream job), so I am not sure how to deal with some things and have probably made a few missteps that have led me to where I am. Regardless, I'd like some advice on how to deal with this without quitting or burning bridges.  I started at a musuem last year and was introduced to a man in his 80s who donates a fair amount of folk art to the museum. Nothing ground-breaking, but he's been doing this for quite a while and has developed a relationship with the org and a friendship with our founding director. When I started, I just thought he was a friendly but crass old man who was maybe a little touchy or that there was a generational gap in understandings of professionalism/appropriateness. I would receive the occasional \"Forwards from Grandpa\" type email with a dirty joke every once in a while, but the relationship quickly crossed a physical line, ie grabbing my hand and holding me uncomfortably close during a handshake, too much touching on my back, comments on my figure or how my clothes fit (I like to keep in shape and am typically well-dressed at work), to a strange amount of him giving me things like old clothes, folk art, or magazines, which I would usually just accept graciously but throw away or donate to Goodwill once he left. I was uncomfortable about it but I also know I can be a very reserved and private person and wanted to be optimistic about it, as it is my job to keep donors happy.   Around Christmas, he invited me to stay at his apartment while he was away, and I tried to politely decline, and he asked if my email was monitored, which I ignored. At a opening reception, he got drunk and openly admitted to me that he knows exactly what he's doing in harassing me, knows that I hate and am made uncomfortable by his comments and actions, and mentioned that he loves to flirt with me simply because he can. this really upset me because my suspicions that he uses his status and \"nice old man\" persona to be a predator. When I had enough and mentioned this to some of the senior employees they basically said \"it's ____, what do you expect? I'm just glad he's not focusing on me any longer\" and discouraged me from bringing it up to our director. I'm not sure if the director is aware of it but I'm also not sure how they wouldn't be at this point. There have been other creepy things he's done since but you get the picture.   What should I do? I've tried keeping a professional arm's length since, or introducing him to my girlfriend but it's just getting worse. I don't want to damage the relationship the org has with him because it's my job to preserve these kinds of giving relationships but I'm kind of at my wit's end with the creepiness and intentional harassment. I figured initially I'd just put up with it until Father Time took care of business but I'd rather stand up for myself at this point.

Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels *Manifesto of the Communist Party*:  >Modern Industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist. Masses of labourers, crowded into the factory, are organised like soldiers. As privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants. Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, by the overlooker, and, above all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself. The more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more embittering it is.  French journalist Simon Linguet (quoted by Karl Marx in *Theories of Surplus Value*):  >\u201cIt is the impossibility of living by any other means that compels our farm labourers to till the soil whose fruits they will not eat, and our masons to construct buildings in which they will not live.  It is want that drags them to those markets where they await masters who will do them the kindness of buying them.  It is want that compels them to go down on their knees to the rich man in order to get from him permission to enrich him\u201d (p. 274).  >\u201cViolence, then, has been the first cause of society, and force the first bond that held it together\u201d (p. 302).  The idea of wage labor being similar to slavery is big in the socialist tradition and especially Marxism. A pre-requisite for capitalism was forcing a majority of the population into a position where they can only survive by selling their labor-power as a commodity. Since your labor-power (your potential to add value in the form of labor) can only be measured in time, you essentially are force to sell yourself as a commodity for agreed upon periods of time.   >The value of labour-power is determined, as in the case of every other commodity, by the labour-time necessary for the production, and consequently also the reproduction, of this special article.  (*Capital vol, 1*)  >The demand for men necessarily governs the production of men, as of every other commodity. Should supply greatly exceed demand, a section of the workers sinks into beggary or starvation. The worker\u2019s existence is thus brought under the same condition as the existence of every other commodity. The worker has become a commodity, and it is a bit of luck for him if he can find a buyer.  (*1844 Manuscripts*)"

Some other sorts of hedonic utilitarians who think that the net suffering of life outweighs that net happiness may also say that it's okay to press the button, but it would depend a lot on whether there would be other methods of fixing this problem. For example, suppose that there is a chance that with enough luck and technological innovation, there will be a future of almost infinite happiness for people (and animals) and almost no suffering. If this chance exists, then those hedonic utilitarians would be pressed to find some defense of their choice to press the button, which would, in effect cancel out all our chances of achieving that future. Finally, desire and preference-based utilitarians of many sorts would say that it would be immoral to press the button because even if life were largely suffering, you are frustrating or thwarting the strong desires or preferences of living beings to continue living. Finally, of course, utilitarianism might not be the right ethical theory at all. I can't think of any deontologists who would say that such a decision would be permissible, for example.  So in summary, the vast majority of ethical camps would say it's immoral and you'd have to turn to some pretty obscure and difficult-to-defend positions (such as that utilitarianism is true and happiness doesn't morally matter AT ALL or that we have very, very low chances of solving the problems of suffering in other ways) in order to confidently say it's permissible. This is at least my humble take on this issue."

(Sorry I rarely post so I don't know how to make variables look nice. Please bear with me).   First we can quickly reason from experience that it has to depend on the frictional coefficient of the floor.  Let's imagine the extremes. If the floor was ice, then we know from experience we should just push and likewise if the floor was glue we know to pick it up and then move it.   Great. Now let's formalize it. First let's generalize the problem. Imagine a string pulling on the object at some angle between horizontal (0) and straight up (90). Let's call this angle Theta. And we'll imagine we can only apply F force in total (the total strength of the two people). Thus in your title you were describing the case where Theta is either 0 or 45.   The math is pretty short. We'll write our forces in terms of Theta. The upward pulling force of the string is F * sin(theta) and the horizontal pulling F * cos(theta) (since F is the hypotenuse these follow directly from the definitions of sin and cos). This makes the friction force easy to calculate. The weight of the object is now (mass * gravity - F sin(theta)) since you're pulling up, and  we just multiply by the friction coefficient mu (u) to get the force of friction: u(m * g - F * sin(theta)).  So our pulling force is F * cos(theta)  and the resisting force is u * m * g - u * F * sin(theta). So overall our object is moving with force F*cos(theta)* - u * m * g + u * F *sin(theta)*.  Now we want to maximize this with respect to Theta as a function of u. We'll take its derivative and set it to zero.   The derivative is -F*sin(theta)* + u * F*cos(theta)*. And set to zero, the F's cancel out, and we get u = sin(theta) / cos(theta) = tan(theta). Thus Theta = arctan(u).  Let's verify it real quick. If we were on ice, mu would be close to 0 and arctan of 0 is 0 degrees which means both people should just push forward. Perfect! And if mu was really high we get closer and closer to 90 degrees so it lines up with our intuition! Hope this was clear and helps you solve similar problems!

It's still true of many of the systems we're interested in that, given some suitable foliation of spacetime into spatial slices, the fields (or general coordinates) and their velocities/momenta specified on any one slice determines what's going on everywhere else. (If this is true, the spacetime is called \"globally hyperbolic\" and the slices are called \"Cauchy surfaces\".) And this determinism can (often, anyway) be given a Hamiltonian treatment in the usual way; i.e. the Hamiltonian generates the dynamics over time as defined by the foliation.  It's just that there may be other ways of foliating the spacetime in such a way that on this slicing too you can give a Hamiltonian treatment of the fields' (or general coordinates') evolution. The second Hamiltonian will typically be different from the first, and there's no objective right or wrong about which one to choose.  A more *manifestly* invariant way of doing dynamics, classically anyway, is with \"covariant Hamiltonian field theory\" (here's a classic paper). In this theory, each field has associated with it not just one but four momenta (each associated with one dimension of spacetime). The quantum version of this approach is not settled."

However, there's evidence that certain aspects of these behaviors may be learned as well. For example, birds of the same species will build the same structure of nest. Additionally, birds raised in captivity with little to no interaction with conspecifics will build nests with the only difference being those nests are of a lower quality than that of birds in the wild.   Spiders and their webs are fascinating case studies on innate behavior. There's been a number of experiments on how chemical substances affect spider web building. Like birds, spiders of the same species will build the same web structure. Not to mention, there's at least one parasitic species of wasp whose larvae hijacks the spider's web building behavior, forcing it to create a cocoon as the larvae feeds on the spider, by \"overriding\" a couple of the web building instructions -- works kind of like code insertion in programming.    I don't know much about bees, though I suspect the mechanisms are similar to spiders. There's a lot of interesting aspects of bees that go back to innate behaviors, such as how queens develop, that's worth further reading.   As for humans, a lot is debatable, but I would argue that two such behaviors are nesting and language. All apes exhibit nesting behavior (ie. Build beds), to the extent that non-human apes in captivity will become distressed when not provided with nesting material. Apes in captivity that have never seen nesting performed by other apes will, if provided with material, nest. Language is a more interesting example as we don't quite know how language evolved. There's heavy evidence that prestructures exist in the brain which influence language development (wernicke's and broca's) but the greatest evidence towards language development as an innate behavior in humans is the Nicaraguan deaf-community where a complex sign language spontaneously emerged amongst youngsters who had otherwise minimal exposure to language.   Edit: Just wanted to add that on the surface language may not seem like what you're getting at, since you're describing somewhat tool use related behaviors, however, there's some theories regarding a relationship between language development and tool use.  Edit 2: Thank you everyone for being as interested in this stuff as me! This has to be my most popular comment and it makes me so happy that it's in science. I had wanted to mention too just the interesting dynamic between the original post's example species. Spiders are the only animal on that list which are not considered a social species and will even cannibalize members of their own species. Interesting food for thought on how much of their behavior is innate considering their lifespan is largely spent without another spider to learn from.

Antibodies to the flu vaccine are produced by plasma B cells, which are proliferating and producing the antibody according to the graph that the other commentator posted. Technically, if you got infected by the real flu once those antibodies are at maximum, your body will probably fight it off instantly. You might not even know you ever got infected.  However, if you don\u2019t get infected by the flu in that short time frame, your antibody titer will drop off dramatically, probably within a week or two (although I\u2019m not sure how fast this drop off actual is). After that, it\u2019s up to a different type of B cell, memory B cells, to respond to an infection. These respond much faster than the initial response and will differentiate and multiply into plasma cells to produce the antibody again.  So, to answer your question, you\u2019re not looking for the time in which it takes for antibodies to form in response to an infection, but the time for a sufficiently large population of memory B cells to form. Since both responses begin at the same time, the timeframe might be (but isn\u2019t necessarily) the same."

The higher the temperature, the higher the average kinetic energy of the atoms or molecules that make up that substance. For most substances, these particles attract one another with a strength governed by the various attractive forces at play, such as electric forces, van der Waals (sp?) forces, and chemical bonds. At low temperatures (and high pressures) the particles don't have enough energy to break these bonds, and the substance is solid. At medium temperatures some but not all of these attractive forces can be overcome, and at high temperatures the particles become completely separated and exist as a gas.   So why are there no in-between states? Because these bonds are binary; either they exist or they don't. Either the temperature is high enough to break the bonds, or it isn't. There is a very clear threshold above which the bonds are broken, and below which they remain intact. This translates into a clear division between states of matter.   Interestingly, because temperature is an average measurement, it's possible (and indeed quite likely) for individual particles to have a much higher or lower kinetic energy than that average and break or form bonds independently of the rest of the substance. This is how water can evaporate without boiling, for instance. It's also possible for particles in a solid substance to gain enough energy to sublimate directly into a gas."

Removing the aether may have been a very bad idea without a sure way to destroy it (a mistake Thor makes later on). Odin would have had no problem sacrificing Jane if necessary. He regularly sacrifices Asgardians to achieve goals and he values humans far less.  Third, the Aether has its own intent and seemed both hostile to Asgardians/Humans and 'friendly' to the Dark Elves. Two Asgardians got thrown across a room just for touching Jane while it left willingly for Malekith. It's possible that this was taken advantage of in some way to extract it or, at least, that Malekith possessed the knowledge of how to control it (indicating that it was a matter of technique rather than pure technological ability)."

However, it is debatable whether he can be considered a *historian*, rather than a philosopher who chose certain historical events and institutions to build a philosophical and critical narrative towards, for example, how psychiatrists and/or psychologists build theories about people, and how society controls its members.  In fact, he is a contentious figure among historians and has been criticized for his choices in historical illustrations, and interpretations of facts and events, e.g.  >**Huppert** was driven to his \"thoughts on Foucault\" by the **dismayed realization that the historically illiterate were taking Foucault as a reliable guide to the European past**.  In fact, Foucault himself distanced himself from the label of historian:  >His attitude toward the discipline was one of wariness mixed with contempt. **\"I am not a professional historian; nobody is perfect,\" he once remarked**. In the Introduction to the second volume of his *Histoire de la sexualit\u00e9*, published just before his death, **he tells us that his works are studies of history but that he is not a historian**. In short he himself underlined his difference from disciplinary history, and rightly so, for he stands apart from the generally unquestioned conceptual and methodological assumptions that define its boundaries.  This is not to deny any value of his ideas, observations and criticisms, nor to ignore his contributions to the social sciences. But it is important to keep in mind that the history *Foucault* presents is not the same history *historians* present, as Foucault had other goals.  ---  In regard to recommending any text about the history of \"madness\" and how society reacted to what we might today consider mental disorders, I would suggest trying to ask /r/AskHistorians if their rules permit it.  Per your reference to how homosexuality, you could check Rachel Cooper's analysis of the DSM and what are its philosophical underpinnings (e.g. its epistemology of mental illness), which she situates historically, specifically in what context the American Psychiatric Association engaged with the issue of homosexuality, what led to its removal and how the definition of mental disorder was changed to avoid similar occurrencesm by adding the *harm criterion*. She also wrote a book about \"diagnosing the diagnostic manual\". But, these are not history papers either, although Cooper does describe the history of the DSM to explain the ideas behind it."

Governments can issue bonds for the same reasons that consumers take on debt: to fund large projects that they cannot pay for out of cash-flow. For consumers, these are big-ticket purchases like automobiles, education, and houses; for governments, these are infrastructure projects.  [Source: public finance literature, particularly when thinking about local governments raising bond issues to fund projects.]  There are other reasons that the government could run budget deficits. For one, because the government \"lives forever,\" it can continue to roll its debt over and only pay interest, not principal. So long as the debt level doesn't grow too fast, the government can run deficits and thereby lower the average tax burden.   A third reason is that there is an active demand for government debt.  This is where the macro-public finance link comes in to play. Governments nearly always pay their debts, so government debt is essentially risk-free. There is consumer and investor demand for risk-free nominally-denominated assets. One can actually solve for an optimal level of government debt to optimally fulfill that demand. Diamond (1965) is the key resource here; besttrousers linked to it. Diamond's paper contains the minimally complete set of model elements that I think are necessary to analyze government debt: overlapping generations and capital accumulation.  [Relatedly, Sameulson's '53 paper also shows one use of government debt as social insurance. But I think Diamond does it better.]  The above three are public-finance or long-run macro reasons to run deficits. There are also cyclical reasons to run a deficit, related to both systematic policy (automatic stabilizers) and to discretionary policy (\"stimulus\").  So there are four \"justifications\" of public debt.  How is it \"okay\"? Well, let's start easy: supply and demand. Governments sell their debt on public markets, and people buy that debt at a price. These are willing mutual transactions, so the onus is on you to tell me why these agents should not be trading."

In addition, it is important to consider that religious affiliation and general spirituality are not in a precipitous decline, but rather support and participation in mainline religious *institutions*. As has been discussed here, faith in and participation in institutions is in decline across the board\u2013religious, medical, educational, civic, and political.  Here is a fantastic survey done by Pew Research Forum on this topic:  http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/  It is my personal theory that this decline can be attributed to two factors: the rise of the power of and enshrinement of the rights of the individual, and the Internet's ability to grant the individual access to the benefits of membership in a collective, without having any dues paid to (figuratively), or subordination to a collective. That is, the individual is largely more powerful than they were in the past. An individual, with the aid of technology, can outproduce a collective of individuals from the past. The individual not only doesn't need the group as much as in the past, but also is more powerful on their own. So, you have an empowered individual, with less loyalty to their collective or community; thus, shame, humiliation, and ostracizing, which were powerful behavioral regulatory tools the group can impose on the individual, have been defanged. And religious institutions, who are examples of this\u2013whose prime purpose was the imposition of values and regulation of behavior, having been defanged, so to speak\u2013have less relevance."

It's not that the going to museums causes you to be tolerant of homosexuality..... remember, Bourdieu's main statistical method is multiple correspondence analysis, it's how things cluster.   Embodying high cultural status (that's the core of habits--embodying things; Bourdieu never really defines it much better in any of his other works) means that you go to museums and are tolerant of homosexuality. Habitus is your tastes, it's your hobbies, it's what brand of beer your drink, it's whether you shake hands or give a high five, it's whether you spit in public, etc. These are *learned*, by imitation generally, and stratified by socio-economic class. But they're not learned at the museum or something like that. The museum is just a quantifiable measurement of your status (maybe not a good one even), it is not the cause of your status.   For more on Bourdieu see my old posts: Bourdieu and Dan Brown; Bourdieu and why beards and fixies won't be mullets and Camaros; Bourdieu and how \"being at ease\" and \"liking everything\" have become high status markers. Of those, the last one might be particularly useful. Check out the linked Shamus Khan chapter if you have a minute, it's like 12 or 16 simple, clear pages, and it gets into how the modern elite habitus is inculcated at an elite boarding school.   I think education or tastes are generally a better proxy than cultural event participation because the events they choose are often very dated and I think in some cases are rare events that people are more likely to answer based on many times they think they should have gone rather than actually went. I just saw an article about participation in Turkey and they were all about events that secular Turks would go to, but not about events that pious Turks would go to. So these measures can just be quite silly, but you shouldn't mistake these measures of cultural capital as causal. Think of them more as degrees on a thermometer than the weather system that causes a heat wave.   For completeness, Bourdieu most famously defined Habitus as:  >s]ystems of durable, transposable dispositions, structured structures predisposed to function as structuring structures, that is, as principles which generate and organize practices and representations that can be objectively adapted to their outcomes without presupposing a conscious aiming at ends or an express mastery of the operations necessary in order to attain them.  The first line of the [wiki page on Habitus doesn't do a bad job either:  >Habitus is a system of embodied dispositions, tendencies that organize the ways in which individuals perceive the social world around them and react to it."

Remember to feed small amounts every few hours.  https://www.sdhumane.org/services/lost-and-found/found-a-kitten/  In addition to food, pay attention to regulating the kitten's body temperature, and stimulating it to urinate and pass feces.

She had stomach x-ray, physical exam and complete blood work done, everything is fine on paper but she keeps suffering. The first vet thinks its acid reflux and the second thinks its a seizure called \"petit mal\", meaning the start of epilepsy. I read all I could find about petit mal (and stomach issues in dogs in general) and watched youtube videos how that seizure looks like, and its nothing like what she goes through.   It all began a week ago, Wednesday early morning. She woke me up asking to go potty and had 2 episodes of diarrhea (melted ice-cream type). She couldn't go up the stairs and was panting heavily, her back legs were shaking as well. She had another 2 episodes of diarrhea the following days (same type) and episodes of panting and shaking which began 1 hour after eating and lasted 2 hours. She is drinking and has an appetite (although a bit declined), but she doesn't want to play like she used to. She goes on walks and goes potty fine (back to solids). There were two incidents when she cried a bit when she was about to go number 2, but didn't show signs of straining.   Her \"episodes\" begins with lip smacking and sounds of swallowing. Then she moves alot, tries to find a different position to lie down, like she is uncomfortable. Sometimes she'll lick whatever is close to her so much that it'll leave a wet mark. Then the heavy panting starts, she'll lay on her stomach or side. After that, her back legs will begin to shake and gradualy become so bad that it's hard for her to walk. She wont go down or up the stairs without help, and won't jump on anything. She also has very scared and sad eyes, something I saw only when she's at the vet. But even during that \"episode\" she's reactive, she'll eat treats (I gave her medication that way) and she'll go out for a walk. She isn't absent, it seems more like she is in pain. She was ok when I didn't give her anything to eat for 12 hours, and even better after 24 hours but the vets told me that what I'm doing is bad since she doesn't vomit, so there's no reason to fast her.   I tried:  1.  Activated charcoal (first thought was that its a poisoning) 2.  Metoclopramide (then I thought maybe nausea) 3.  Omeprazole (first vet said its stomach acid issues). 4.  Metamizole (the only one that seems to kinda help).  All those were by vet recommendation except the last one, which I gave her out of my own account. The Metamizole seems to help, 30 minutes after taking it she seems ok and even jumped by herself on her couch.\n\nAssistant:"

The town I live in is tiny and the vet here is ill equipped; the next city over is a 2 hours car drive where they would have the equipment (i.e. an ultrasound) to try and find the cause of the problem.  Puppy is 5 months old, vaccinated, normally 13.5kg (30lbs) and we rescued him when he was approx 6 weeks old abandoned in a drainage (he's classed as a Southeast Asian village dog by EmbarkVet).  Summary of symptoms:  * Vomits multiple times * Lethargy * Refuses to eat * Weight loss * Very runny stool (occurred only once) * No fever  **Day 1**  I woke my pup up at 7am in his crate to see he's still somewhat asleep. This is weird as normally he'd wake me up and he would usually walk out of the crate within 5 seconds of me opening. We have our morning walk but I cut it short as I see he's not too energetic. I serve him breakfast kibbles and he refused his food. He refused lunch as well. He also refused his treats and would spit it out. I tried chicken breast and he ate it, so I served him a small amount of rice and chicken breast because it concerned me he wasn't taking anything. That was the only meal he had. He was very low energy the whole day and spent his time on the couch chilling. He also did not poop at all this day.  **Day 2**  I woke him up at 7am again to see he has vomited in his crate. He seemed energetic so we had a short walk and he finally pooped (solid stool) and on the way back, he vomited white/yellow foam bile. He vomited again two more times at home. We waited for the nearby vet to open at 9am to bring him. Vet prescribed metoclopramide (for the vomiting?), liver support pills and b-plex. They also gave us Royal Canin Convalesce Support (RCCS) to force feed him. Back home, he ends up vomiting out all the pills we gave and all the food we force fed. He also vomited every time he drank water. Puppy has no energy and we see visible weight loss  **Day 3**  I woke him up at 7am again and he's vomited 2 times in his play pen. We brought him back to the vet and told them about day 2. We asked for an IV drip (administered under the skin) as he was now skin and bones and dehydrated. He's also lost 1.5kg (3lbs). During this time, he had a runny stool outside the vet's office which the vet saw. No blood, just very runny. They prescribed metronidazole (antibiotics) which they helped him take. We also managed to get him to take the metoclopramide and both pills stayed down. We force fed him a small amount of the RCCS 2 hours after the vet visit and he puked it all out 5 minutes after. My SO & I decided to not feed him at all to allow his stomach to recover (after doing some googling) as we notice the vomiting happens after he drinks water or we feed him the RCCS. In the evening, we got him to take the pills but he puked out the antibiotics minutes after he drank a bit of water.  **Day 4**  This is where I'm at now, we just woke him up at 630am and it is now 8am my time. Luckily he hasn't vomited in his pen which is a positive sign but he still refuses food and has no energy. He's looking even thinner than he was yesterday. Our options are either, go to another vet nearby for a second opinion or drive up 2 hours to the city and get him checked there and ask for an ultrasound to see what's going on in his stomach. Or we stick to the prescribed plan and ride it out. We have not given him his pills yet this morning as we fear he may puke it out again. We feel quite defeated that everytime we force feed his pill or food, he is hating us for handling him in such a way and he ends up vomiting soon after.  Any advice?\n\nAssistant:"

In this case, people who are *already overweight* see themselves represented in fashion, they see clothes on models that match their own body type so they can envision it better, and the range of diversity show in body types means that it covers for a variety of people.   To normalize something in this context is good. Fat people *still* deserve representation. They still deserve to see people lik themselves interacting in society and wearing clothes that are fashionable.   Fat people exist. They have money to spend and they need clothes, they need furniture, they need to buy outfits for weddings and for funerals and for sports and for business and for running around with the kids in winter. Not showing them does not erase their existence but it *does* alienate them from society. It means that they don't feel welcomed in shops, by brands, and they feel ostracised. Being ostracised for their weight *does not make them unfat*. In fact, it increases the likelihood of them being fatter for longer. Taking away the ability to see themselves frustrates them, makes them less likely to dress well and to dress in fashionable styles, less likely to contribute to the fashion economy, and feel less positive about engaging in being fashionable and feeling good about themselves.   There are many elements to this - social, political, economical, psychological - but one thing we do know through years of research is that people who feel like shit about their body and don't see positive representations are more likely to internalize negative thoughts and processes and to repeat negative behaviors. By encouraging them to see themselves as 'normal' and not strange and weird and illfitting in society, we begin to start that process of encouraging people to be comfortable with their bodies and therefore being able to change it and not return to that unheathy cycle/place.   This is *one element* to reducing weight gain and changing our understanding towards obesity in society and there are many facets to it. Many. Dozens.   Let's also be clear here that showing a fat model or even a hundred of them does not *cause* people to be fat. It does not *glorify* it if someone happens to be fat and models a dress or walks the catwalk.   The problem with the thinness of models was not that a model was 'genetically thin', or that they had a 'thin body type'. Even now, thin models are still in high demand. The criticism of 'thin' models is of the excessively thin ones, particularly in the 2000s.   They were *anorexic*. They had a serious mental health condition that has the single highest mortality rate, publicly, and rather than being encouraged to seek mental health support, they were being put on a catwalk and made to wear high fashion clothes as part of an ensemble of luxury. It was repeatedly leaked to the press about diets such as the cotton ball diet, eating nothing but cabbage soup or ice, and exercising excessively to get down to weights that were genuinely unsafe for their heights and ages. They stopped having periods, they were physically unwell, and the body type was *glorified*. It was shown as an aspirational goal , and designers made clothing that showed off their bodies in this condition. Celebrities began to appear in similar condition, and pop culture began to publicly espouse such dangerous trends and encourage a fixation on weight as being synonymous with health.   It was not that they had a thin body or even that it was very thin that was the most problematic part. Being thin is also normal and a natural body condition. Thin people also need representation. It was the way that it was glorified, highlighted, and effectively 'sold' as a lifestyle that made it a toxic and dangerous example to set for young people. Models were exclusively very thin, and even still thin but slightly larger models were shamed and not given as much work as the thinnest models. Protruding collarbones bones, visible ribs, and a gaunt look were \u2018in\u2019 but the way to achieve such weight was actively dangerous.  The same is not happening with fat bodies. Encouraging people to love themselves and to express happiness in their own body is not saying, \"being fat is the best! It's the single greatest gift to humanity and we should all become extra fat!\" Unhappy, stressed people who hate their own bodies do not want to engage in changing long held habits, take up radical life changes, or investigate their mental blocks when it comes to achieving weight loss."

So, *at the very least*, they can avoid being conquered indefinitely.  Which leaves them free to pursue an asymmetrical strategy against the muggles- between invisibility, teleportation and various spells that allow them to spy, they're set. They don't even need to kill anybody, just waiting for opportunities to zap muggle leaders with the Imperius curse would be sufficient.  If they really want to fuck up a target, they need only let loose a quick Fiendfyre spell and apparate away immediately after, leaving the Fiendfyre to lay waste to the area.

Let me demonstrate how small the Wizarding world (in the UK at least) is:  In Deathly hallows chapter 10 it is stated that almost every Wizarding child goes to Hogwarts so we can use the size of Hogwarts to estimate the size of the Wizarding world. Looking at the great hall from the films I estimate that Hogwarts has around 300 students, but lets say 400 to be safe, assuming 90% of all wizarding children go to Hogwarts, the number of 11 to 17 year old wizards at about 450. Assuming that the age distribution of the wizarding world is the same as the rest of the UK (where 10-19 year olds make up 7.65% of the population) that puts the total number of wizards at 5882 people as an upper estimate, and thats including the  families of muggle born wizards.   At the same time the British armed forces has approximately 150,000 soldiers currently, and at its height during World war 2 contained 1.1 million soldiers. So if the UK doesn't declare a state of Total war the muggle army outnumbers the total Wizarding population 25 to 1, and 250 to 1 assuming the UK can mobilise the same proportion of its population in the case of total war.  And remember this is comparing the number of muggle soldiers to an upper estimate of the total number of wizards, most of which will not be proficient in combat, let alone supported by the necessary logistic networks to conduct a war (which already exists for the UK army)."

For the record, I'm one of these workers and deliver food 4-5 days per week.  As far as I can tell, there are two central issues of hourly pay and benefits. I've included my positions on these two below but if there's another issue I'm missing, mention it and I'll address it.  Hourly Pay:  These apps aren't designed for people to work 8-12 hours per day. In most markets this simply is an unrealistic expectation by the worker. Most of these apps don't even market themselves as a replacement for the 9-5 job, they market themselves as a side hustle to \"help pay the bills\" or \"earn some extra cash\". This, they do perfectly. You can't expect to log onto the app at 9AM and to perform like it's the dinner rush, it isn't a video game where there's an unlimited supply of orders. If you use it as a side hustle (as it is intended) and work during one of the rushes, you can make plenty. My personal experience is that I consistently make $15-20 per hour *after* putting a per-mile amount aside off the top to cover vehicle wear and tear. But yes, if you sit there the whole day expecting orders when nobody is ordering because it isn't lunch/dinnertime, you aren't going to make a very good wage.  The Issue of Benefits:  Most other employers who employ people in lower skill work generally don't provide benefits to their employees, partially as most of those employees work >40 hours per week. So, why should these companies be forced to provide benefits such as health insurance, PTO, etc? For the record though, workman's compensation is a whole different issue.\n\nAssistant:"

Here, you could independently create a contract with certain restaurants as you please.  The system above would cut out the middle man. Of course having UberEats or DoorDash connect the drivers with the restaurants is easier, but it inevitably foists the extra costs of corporate middle-manship onto consumers and restaurants, all while not offering the drivers benefits or salaries.   If a company wants to be the middle man between restaurant and driver, then the drivers should be *employees* of the delivery company. Right now, the big delivery companies are benefitting off of charging everyone down the chain, including the drivers in a tangential way. Yes, you do make money, but you're in a way paying for the service of being connected to restaurants and orders."

Firstly, I'm sorry if this topic has been debated before, I couldn't find anything that I felt related directly to it in the popular post archive.  My main point is that sports provide a number of advantages to boys and girls from kindergarten through high school that cannot be replicated by video games. *I am referring to all physical activity, including playing games like tag, manhunt, red rover, etc., as sports to reduce confusion*. I realize that there is a team vs. individual sports distinction that can be made as well as a distinction between activity and sport. Until I get into a deeper conversation I'll refer to both as sports.  I am 24 years old and grew up right in the middle of what I consider to be the proliferation of video game consoles in households. My parents did not let me play very much or very often, instead encouraging my sisters and I to play outside. I became highly involved in sports and I believe they have had a very positive impact on my life. The positive physiological and psychological effects of exercise on the human body are well established.  However, video games are controversial in this manner. There are many positive side effects, but also many negatives. The legitimacy of many studies has been called into question.  I believe that video games create a very isolated, insulated social life for those who play them. Many people seem to develop a certain disdain for their peers and, in my opinion, would benefit greatly from team activity. Sure, there are MMOs that require teamwork, but I do not believe they can mimic the physical sacrifice and the emotion of interaction with others on a field/court/other playing surface.  In my experience, people who categorize themselves as \"gamers\" have fewer friends, especially female friends. They seem disconnected from many aspects of social life and also seem quick to prove that they are smarter than the person with whom they are speaking. I realize that I may not be able to easily connect with these people socially because we do not share a common interest, but even in watching the interaction of those who I know to play video games on a daily basis with others there is noticeable discomfort when they speak with people they do not know.  My conclusions are based largely on my own experiences. I do play video games occasionally, but I quickly tire of them and they are mostly sports games like FIFA or NHL games (although I do play GTA V a fair amount). However, I spend much more time outdoors, playing basketball, football, tennis, golf, etc. I believe that there is far more to be gained by playing a sport, be it individual or team than there is to be gained playing video games. I also believe that it is crucial to get young children outdoors and participating in any physical activity we can. There are numerous studies that show playing sports is very beneficial and these benefits are far greater than any benefit gained through video games.

In the comments you acknowledge that sports carry their own risks, and that everything is good in moderation.  You even seem to support the position that video games have some benefits.  If you phrase it as a binary, \"sports are better than video games\" then you walk down a slippery slope.    Forget arguing that sports are better, surely there a plenty of things that are a better use of most children's time.  You say sports are better than video games, maybe i say tennis is better than football, because it is safer, or even that football is better than tennis, because it is more competitive.  Whatever the argument, asking someone to change their view on which is \"better\" is not the beginnings of a fruitful, view-changing discussion.    When you phrase it like that, of course people who prefer video games get defensive.  You are forcing them either to bring sports down a peg, or raise up video games.  They rightfully point out that the line of causality may go from being a loner to enjoying video games and not the other way around.  Just as being tall pushes some kids to basketball, and being large to football, and being gregarious to drama club, being more introverted can be a push towards video games.  If a high school coach says he should have all of the drama clubs funding because sports are \"better\" than drama club, would you support his proposal?  If the football team decided to defund the chess team because football is \"better,\" who would you support?  The thing is, sports are better than video games for developing the minds of some children, (admittedly, probably most children) but i for one am grateful for the fact that the kids who don't like sports have something engaging to do.  Even if the gamers are in the minority."

In a Ford Model T, for example, the tank was under the seat and you'd flip the seat up to access it.  There are some cars that put in the middle front or back, but it turns out that was more hazardous if you got in an accident. The Chevy Bell Air hid the fuel filler behind a real tail light -- that sort of thing isn't legal anymore.  New rules say that the fuel filler has to go on the long side of a car, and inside of any crumple zones that might get crushed in a collision. It would be super tricky to build them into the door, so your four spots are the four corners of the passenger compartment.  European car manufacturers tend to favor the passenger side, unless it's got a sliding door whose mechanism makes that impossible. The idea is that it keeps the individual fueling the car away from the street while refueling roadside. Some American automakers have the same philosophy.  Japanese car makers tend to favor placing the filler on the driver's side (as do some American car makers). Their thinking is that they don't want the driver walking around the car to fuel at a gas station.  In some instances, it's simply a matter of having to place the filler in a certain spot because the engineers have other components that have to fit in certain spaces (to accommodate doors, special electronic features, etc.). They are usually in the back because the fuel tank usually sits in the back (because the engine and transmission take up room in the front).  Electric cars don't have the same restrictions, but they do tend to place the charge ports towards the end of the car to make it so fast-charge cords needn't be very long. While there are a couple that place the port in the front (Leaf, Kona EV, and e-Niro) or back (EV6), most place it on the side so that it's less likely to be damaged in a collision."

The letter said they would be contacting the police if we do not hand the phone over, but the thing is, we are all confused as to how the phone ended up in our house, supposedly.   I say supposedly because this situation does not make sense.   We only live next to two other houses. There's a main road that leads from the exit down past our house. We live off of a side road, and our house is the last house on the back of this road. I hope that makes sense, I don't really know how else to explain it.   So, anyway, we contacted the people who left the note and they said they were going to the gas station that's near our house and it fell off the hood of their car.   But they gave us their address and they live on the other side of town, no where near our house. Our house isn't even in the path to go to said gas station from where they live.  I guess my question is, can police get a warrant sorely based off an app pinging the phone to our location? do they need more proof that the phone is at our house?

Instead of just denying or approving the request, the prosecutor\u2019s office contacted local LE claiming I had filed an \u201cillegal FOIA request.\u201d The police (who I have learned are apparently bosom-buddies with the prosecuting attorney and his employees) tracked down a close relative of mine, and attempted to interrogate them about my reason for filing the \"illegal\" FOIA. This was obviously an intimidation tactic, but is it something I should consider contacting a civil rights attorney over? Most government officials know not to even ask a journalist why they are making a FOIA request, and this is by far the most extreme response to a FOIA I've ever experienced. Even most corrupt officials will just deny your FOIA request.  This happened a few months ago, and in that timeframe the prosecutor apparently also destroyed the records I was seeking.  A few additional facts that may be pertinent:  * I am a freelance journalist now, but put in four years at a large newspaper. I maintain current credentials with a press association.  * The incident happened in Missouri. Yes, I know FOIAs are called Sunshine Law requests here. Just using \"FOIA\" as a metonym. * Sunshine Law and FOIA requests can be \"invalid,\" but are never \"illegal.\" * This was my first contact with the prosecutor's office, so there was no \"history\" to explain their reaction. * I wasn't just \"fishing.\" The FOIA request was very targeted at records that should have confirmed what my source was saying. * My family was absolutely terrified by the incident. They assumed, based on the demeanor of the investigating police officer, that I had gotten myself into real trouble. They are very afraid of what could happen if re-open my work on the story. * My ability to act as a journalist in the community (at least in regards to LE and the prosecutor's office) has been crippled by this matter.  After doing some research, I found that Missouri has two statutes that may be applicable - one against harassment (RSMo 565.090) and another that prohibits false reports to law enforcement (RSMo 575.080). There is also a Federal statute called Conspiracy Against Rights (18 U.S. Code \u00a7 241) that I think may be applicable (since the prosecutor involved an assistant in contacting LE).

A week ago a coworker sent me pictures and a video of the incident posted by the cyclist. Police don't seem to care at all and are telling me it is a civil issue now. Hi, i am in Ontario Canada and i am looking for some help.  On August 24th around 4 PM i was jogging with my dog on a paved trail. This path is considered mixed use and you see everyone from cyclists to joggers to just people sitting around and watching nature. As i was jogging someone on a bicycle came ripping around a corner at an extremely high speed, and collided with my dog and me. I just remember being hit and then apparently my head slammed against the ground.  Someone else just behind us saw the incident, and apparently the cyclist after colliding with us took off. The lady ended up calling 911 and i was rushed to the emergency room, while this lady apparently rushed my dog to an emergency vet, where he passed away on the way. I ended up getting a bunch of stitches on my head, and suffered from a few cracked ribs.  I explained what happened to the police and they made a report but since they had no way to id the person they couldn't do much.  Last week a coworker who knew about my incident DM'ed me a bunch of pictures of a post in a facebook group, along with the video of the incident. The asshole was complaining about his bike being damaged and how people shouldn't be allowed to walk along this certain path. Not long after it was posted it was removed.  I ended up bringing this information to the police and said they would investigate. Today after not hearing anything i contacted the same officer, who told me the file is closed and it is now a civil issue as it was obviously an accident. I don't understand how this can be true or fair. Can someone enlighten me?\n\nAssistant:"
