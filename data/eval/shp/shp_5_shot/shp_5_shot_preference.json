    "\n\nHuman: How to research publications of potential PhD supervisors ? Say I have a running list of faculty names whose research work I want to look at in order to short list whose research aligns with my topic of interest. This is the approach I tend to take    Go to google scholar  Researchgate  Orcid  Google  Uni website but the ones I am interested in have next to no data in their sites.   Is this the most comprehensive/ exhaustive  list ? If I search at all these , can I say with confidence I have seen all there is to see? If after all this I don\u2019t find a topic of my research, is it safe to conclude the particular profesor has not worked on this topic at all ?\n\nAssistant:": {

I will add, however, that early career researchers may have fewer publications (but they should still have SOME publications).  In the case that you are finding publications but they are just not relevant to your research interests, this may suggest you and the potential PhD supervisor are not a good match. It is reasonable to worry about finding a good PhD supervisor(s), but it could be WAY worse to end up in a lab you are not passionate about for 4+ years.  Good luck!"

    "\n\nHuman: How much leeway do professors get in choosing what they write? Are professors allowed to write on and publish whatever topics they choose? I understand this somewhat falls under what tenure is and why it exists, but I'm not really asking about controversial stuff. Let's say I'm a prof in a political science department at X school. Does the department care about the topics I'm writing on? Does anyone else at the school care? If a professor starts shifting from one discipline to another - say pure politics to political economy to largely just economics - what would happen? Does it matter as long as they are publishing? How does this change as a PhD candidate / assistant prof / tenured prof?  Thanks!\n\nAssistant:": {

So some degree of knowledge or collaboration is needed if I completely change fields.  However, if I continue publishing (and depending on the field, continue receiving grant funding), the university typically does not care what I do.  As for over the lifetime of an academic...when search committees are looking for a potential hire, they often have a general research area in mind (sometimes they have a very specific research area in mind, such as they may be looking for a research collaborator, and sometime they have what is known as an \"open\" search where they are very broad).  It is not uncommon that your research will not be exactly what you did during your PhD or post-doc because now it is your own research and not your advisor's.  That being said, you will probably stay in your general area of expertise because you have a ticking clock (5-10 years) to get enough research productivity/funding to get tenure.  People often pick up side-projects during this time that may die off or may become whole new ares of pursuit.  But, for your tenure application, you typically want to sell yourself has having a particular focused expertise on a research topic.  They want to see that you have developed an academic reputation.  If you publish one paper on one topic and another paper on another topic, it will be hard for anyone to know you in any particular field.  So for practical purposes, people tend to focus on no more than a few major research questions.    Once you get tenure, this becomes a good opportunity to make a switch (if you want).  That side project maybe becomes more interesting, or a grad student throws out a crazy idea that you get excited about.  However, many researchers would like to get full professor some day, so keeping yourself grounded in a particular area can still be important.  However this may be where you start to develop distinct research lines.  Full professors have the greatest ability to \"play around\" with different ideas.    As for the departments, they mostly do not care.  They care about what classes you are willing and able to teach.  But over the years, if your research drifts so that you feel you are better off teaching different classes, they will hire new profs to teach the classes you used to teach (in an ideal world).  You may have been hired because of your expertise in special equipment or facilities the university has and if you stop contributing because your interests shift, that could ruffle some feathers.  But, if you are working in that kind of environment, grant money is going to be the most important thing, and if your new research interests are bringing in grant money, they mostly will not care.  One thing, though, they will care about is if your new research interests require institutional support.  For instance, I could come up with the greatest idea for how to fight Ebola, and the CDC would be willing to give me a $1 million to test it, if only my university would build me a Biosafety level 4 lab, it is just not going to happen.  This is an absurd example, but, you do have to have institutional buy-in for some types of research.  I know my university will not even build me a biosafety level 2 lab, or never upgrade facilities to do primate research, or buy me an fMRI, etc., etc. so I have to think about those kind of things when I think about new areas of research.  **tl;dr:** Professor have academic freedom to pursue the research topics that interests them.

    "\n\nHuman: I'm looking for programs or apps that can help me organize, reference and look up knowledge and information. Description inside. Hello!  I'll be brief. I am a sociology student. I have a substantial need for organizing and notetaking.  I was wondering if a program of the following description or similar exists:  I want to be able to create various brief \"nodes\" of knowledge. Say I have a node that claims \"Men are more likely than women to be sexual initiators\" or something like that. Then I would link this node to any number various studies that I know of that back up this claim.   Another node could be \"Men associate social status with frequency of sexual activity\", to which I would also link various sources that back up this claim. Some of these could be the same as the sources from the above or other nodes.  This \"vault\" of knowledge could contain any number of nodes in various categories. Nodes could also be hierarchical with children and parent nodes. I view it as a way to structure and organize what I know and from where I know it.   Also, the reverse could be done. I could look up any study/source and then find all nodes/claims that I have linked to that source, given an overview of what \"knowledge\" this source contain (that are relevant to me).  Does it make sense? Does anything of the sort exist? I am a bit nervous that there some obvious answer, but I needed to share my thoughts.  **TL;DR: Looking for a tool to structure and organize my \"knowledge\" and where that knowledge is from (and the reverse).**\n\nAssistant:": {

I\u2019m a graduating senior that\u2019s taking a gap year before grad school, all of my close professors etc are aware of this and have give me their support. I found a job I want to apply for last month and promptly requested the required 3 letters of recommendation for it. There was a bit of delay in response from those I asked (maybe because it was at the tail end of winter break?) but ultimately, they all agreed with one asking I send them a reminder a few days before the deadline.  Since then, I have only received 1 and the application is due in 2 days. I sent the two individuals I haven\u2019t received the letter from a gentle reminder / thank you to see what\u2019s going on, and literally, no response from either. I have good relationships with these individuals and they\u2019ve always expressed to me that they would be happy to write me letters of recommendation for jobs, grad school, whatever. I\u2019m feeling kinda hurt to be honest, I\u2019ve worked (and am currently working for) for these people who both applauded me for being a good employee. What do I do? It\u2019s definitely too short of notice to find 2 replacements.

I like my job (I work in a college library), but I feel like I can do more with my life. I want to go back to school, and I want to major in something I'm passionate about, not necessarily something practical (and if I stick with library science, my undergrad can be in anything).  I love anthropology, particularly archaeology, and have decided that will be my undergrad; perhaps I'll even get my Master's. I know job prospects are low, but as I said, I want to follow my passion.  My question is, given I have full-time obligations, is there a chance that I'll end up frozen out of opportunities because I can't devote as much time outside of school as other students? I don't have a lot of time to go to conferences or work in the field. I'm afraid I'll get through school and end up without any connections or enough work in the field to be taken seriously.  tl/dr: is there hope for an older adult returning to school to find a career in anthropology?\n\nAssistant:": {

To dodge this issue you could try going to a community college for the first two years with the mission of getting really good grades and then transferring to your local university; this way, if you are passionate and determined enough to get the grades you need to transfer, you'll make it in, and if you're not then you won't have wasted much money.  I give this advice because although it is probably possible to get into the field with another full-time job, it will be much harder and put you at a disadvantage over other young graduates. You might be able to overcome the adversity but you would have to be really determined to do it.

They understand there is a lot of sentiment from local tribes about this sort of thing. I really don\u2019t care for those in the tribes advocating for the collections of these bodies for four reasons.  1. When a body is located anywhere in california, there is 3-6 tribes disputing who\u2019s it belongs to. This alone is a waste of time. It\u2019s almost entirely speculation of which tribe the body was associated with, usually it will go to the closest tribal region. (If its found in Coastal Miwok territory, it will be deemed Coastal Miwok unless proven otherwise).   2. The borders defined are based on modern delineations for the most part. In California specifically borders changed a lot. Tribes would be constantly changing their influential spheres often merging and separating from each other making it redundant to assign the remains of a body to a certain region just based on modern delineation.  3. There was so much information about native american history that has been destroyed or misinformed. I have a real pet-peeve when I go into information museums, put on by local tribe members, who don\u2019t have accurate information.

Cream is properly sealed in the factory, but once you open it you introduce it to bacteria and other things in the air where you live. The expiration date immediately changes once you've opened the package and the same is true of home-made food like buttercream.

            " I've done both for almost 20 years and they are very different. Being a pastry cook at fine dining is pretty intense. If you like the thrill of plating and all of that, that's one thing. There is also a fair amount of pressure as you are doing production. Some (most) restaurants have a morning production cook, and a pm plater. It's definitely it's own animal. As a pastry chef it's cool, but as a cook, I'm not a fan.   Hotel, bakery or country club is more focused on production and volume. I learned my bulk of pastries doing these jobs. I started at 5am at a luxury hotel, prepped for banquets (and the restaurant) until 1:30. It was just getting the work done in large batches, stocking the freezer up with mousse cakes, biscuits, tart shells, etc...   It's important to really get a variety of experience in so you know a lot and learn what appeals to you. Production for chain restaurants, large bakeries, small bakeries, fine dining, hotel banquet kitchens, country clubs, ice cream shops, etc... There are so many outlets. If you don't like it because it is hard, I would say go find a production job where someone can take you under their wing and do large batches of things so the techniques become second nature to you.",

If for example, you end up in a Las Vegas hotel where volumes are crazy, the pastry department will be broken down into specialty groups so you won't have the same exposure I describe here.  * pros: most exposure to a wider range of desserts, most scheduling choices * cons: super high paced, constant interruptions, very complex setup * schedule: flexible, ranging from early AM baker, day or evening shifts * pastries: widest range of pastry and exposure due to the large range of services provided  you mentioned that the job was hard. big news, the kitchen industry is not an easy place to work. it is very physically and mentally demanding. not sure what you mean by \"it's really hard\" but if you are looking for a breather in between some desserts then you've entered the wrong industry. to be successful in this industry you need to work hard. raise your standards and aim for the best product. never cut corners and make shortcuts. you get what you put into the career. making lousy, sloppy desserts is NOT an option. strive for perfection. question everything. never stop learning. these are the ethics you need to engrain in your work habits to be successful in this career."

If for example, you end up in a Las Vegas hotel where volumes are crazy, the pastry department will be broken down into specialty groups so you won't have the same exposure I describe here.  * pros: most exposure to a wider range of desserts, most scheduling choices * cons: super high paced, constant interruptions, very complex setup * schedule: flexible, ranging from early AM baker, day or evening shifts * pastries: widest range of pastry and exposure due to the large range of services provided  you mentioned that the job was hard. big news, the kitchen industry is not an easy place to work. it is very physically and mentally demanding. not sure what you mean by \"it's really hard\" but if you are looking for a breather in between some desserts then you've entered the wrong industry. to be successful in this industry you need to work hard. raise your standards and aim for the best product. never cut corners and make shortcuts. you get what you put into the career. making lousy, sloppy desserts is NOT an option. strive for perfection. question everything. never stop learning. these are the ethics you need to engrain in your work habits to be successful in this career.",
        "rejected_target": " I've done both for almost 20 years and they are very different. Being a pastry cook at fine dining is pretty intense. If you like the thrill of plating and all of that, that's one thing. There is also a fair amount of pressure as you are doing production. Some (most) restaurants have a morning production cook, and a pm plater. It's definitely it's own animal. As a pastry chef it's cool, but as a cook, I'm not a fan.   Hotel, bakery or country club is more focused on production and volume. I learned my bulk of pastries doing these jobs. I started at 5am at a luxury hotel, prepped for banquets (and the restaurant) until 1:30. It was just getting the work done in large batches, stocking the freezer up with mousse cakes, biscuits, tart shells, etc...   It's important to really get a variety of experience in so you know a lot and learn what appeals to you. Production for chain restaurants, large bakeries, small bakeries, fine dining, hotel banquet kitchens, country clubs, ice cream shops, etc... There are so many outlets. If you don't like it because it is hard, I would say go find a production job where someone can take you under their wing and do large batches of things so the techniques become second nature to you."

I tried to make a pizza in the top tiny oven when we first got it. \"This way it won't heat up the house!\"   Turns out the top oven is heated via the broiler- and the space was to small to give it adequate room. So what I got was nearly burned on top, and undercooked on the bottom. The heating element was just to close to the top of the pizza. It was horrible. I ended up throwing it out.  Learning from my mistake, I made a second one in the bigger bottom oven (convection option turned on) and... I burned that one to.   I was so frustrated. I was following the directions when it came to heat and time and everything!   Turns out the convection action of the oven makes it run a bit hotter. So you either cook stuff for less time, or at a lower heat.   My dad looked at the manual and made it autoconvert the temp so it would stop burning things.   The third time I was successful. I did a regular bake in the larger oven and watched it like a hawk.   Finally, success!   tl;dr; pizza needs space to cook properly- a toaster oven is to small so it'll cook weird. And convection runs hot so you'll burn it. The directions are there for a reason!",

    "\n\nHuman: I can't get the perfect soft boiled eggs because my egg yolks are never centred, causing the yolk to start \u201chardening\u201d before the egg white has solidified in the middle. Am I storing my eggs wrong or is there something I'm missing? As title suggests, I want to make the perfect soft boiled eggs where the egg white has solidified but the egg yolk is still runny (6 - 6.30 min eggs). My issue is most of the egg yolks sit towards one side and when I take my egg out the whites in the middle is still runny while the egg yolk that's closest to the egg has started to harden. Any longer cooking time would cook the white, yes, but it would also cook the yolk more.   This probably happens with half of the soft boiled eggs I make and I usually cook 3 eggs at a time if it makes a difference.  My eggs are stored on the egg trays as they come. Is this an issue of me storing my eggs wrong? Or possibly do older eggs cause this for some reason?

All good, I've been injured before, but this morning I'm typing away on my keyboard and in instant, like 0 to 100, I went from completely normal to a \"you're about to die feeling\". Besides being incredibly scary, I was so nauseous and felt so sick, like the kind of sick you feel when you have the flu. Although I tried to throw up, I couldn't, I started sweating like crazy and then had to sit on the floor...kneeling was not even good enough, I had to sit, my head was spinning, I legit felt like I was about to die.      I managed to get myself up to the couch, my brother saw me and said I looked incredibly pale, got me a piece of toast and water and like within a few minutes I felt back to normal. I wanted to call an ambulance during the episode (whatever it was) but then I felt instantly better, so I was like, what am I going to tell the paramedics when they arrive?      Throughout the day (up until now) I've felt better, but what happened? Im eating okay...I didn't eat anything out of the ordinary, was it my foot injury? I mean it hurts really bad to walk, but man, was that episode scary.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: 1 year old sudden loss of vision On Thursday, my 15 month old\u2019s babysitter noticed that she wasn\u2019t making eye contact like normal. At home, I noticed the same thing. Normally, if I look at her and smile she smiles back. But it looked like she was looking right past me. Along with that, she was not tracking objects with her eyes.  I took her to the pediatrician on Friday who was concerned and wanted her to see an ophthalmologist right away. So we did that, she had a full eye exam with her eyes dilated and there was nothing wrong (like far sightedness or strabismus etc) with her eyes. The ophthalmologist was concerned too and called a neurologist who wanted us to go to the ER so we could be admitted into neurology over the weekend.  The ER did a lot of blood work, a spinal tap for fluid (I can\u2019t remember the name- I\u2019m sorry.) and the doctors there just generally said they were stumped.  We are on day 2 of being in the pediatric neurology unit. She\u2019s having an EEG done for 24 hours and hopefully an MRI today. The neurologist says he\u2019s fairly confident she isn\u2019t having seizures but wants to cover everything.  I hope one or both of those things gives us an answer but in the mean time all I have to do is think. What could possibly have caused this loss of vision seemingly overnight? She responds to sounds but not objects. She\u2019s had hundreds of lights (from nurses doctors etc) flashed right in her eyes and she does nothing like you\u2019d expect. They shined a light in my eyes to show me how abnormal it was that she did nothing because I instinctively moved my eyes.  Also... no falls, no high fevers, no recent illness, her birth was normal, she\u2019s developmentally normal.  Does anyone have any idea of what this could be?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Sorry to hear about your daughter. It is hard to know the cause without all the test results at the current time, especially the MRI, as this seems to be something less common. If she looks well in other aspects (except for the vision loss), and has already been evaluated by a pediatrician, ophthalmologist, and a pediatric neurologist, you are doing everything you can, and it seems that everything necessary is being done. Vision requires normal eyes, normal optic nerves connecting the eyes to the brain, and normal function of the visual cortex of the brain, and of course normal response to vision requires good function of the rest of the brain. Generally most problems affecting the eyes affect only one eye at a time, and can be seen by the ophthalmologist (either anterior chamber problems such as cataracts or posterior chamber issues such as retinoblastoma). Problems affecting the optic nerves (e.g optic neuritis) are more often seen in older kids (e.g with multiple sclerosis) and are very rare at 15 months. Rarely, there can be problems near where the optic nerves come together just behind the eyes (optic chiasma) when masses (eg. craniopharyngioma)/cysts push on them and can cause visual loss. It is also rare for things to affect the visual cortex of the brain. I suspect that the MRI will be of help. If it does find something, it might need other specialists (e.g. neurosurgeon) to provide further information on management.",

    "\n\nHuman: Advice for dealing with distressed neighbour with Alzheimer\u2019s Female, age 50+ (early onset Alzheimer\u2019s)  My neighbour has Alzheimer\u2019s, newly diagnosed. She lives with her husband of thirty years. I don\u2019t know her very well, but with increasing frequency she is turning up at my house at night, highly distressed. She is carrying belongings, asking to move in, trying to get in the door, claiming she is frightened and is trying to escape... With this pandemic I\u2019m not able to invite her in to calm her down, and I don\u2019t want her to wander off in that state and get lost/in trouble/exposed to covid because she\u2019s not aware of the risks (one time she was waiting for a bus). The first time this happened I took her claims of a stranger in her house at face value, and called the police. Now I am aware of what\u2019s going on, I\u2019d like to be better equipped to help.     I recognise this issue is not mine to solve - her husband needs to be able to make the home secure, and look to ongoing support - but I am looking for help in how to talk to someone in that state to not make them more distressed or confused, and how to encourage them home. Do you go along with the narrative (previously an aggressive lodger, a student that won\u2019t leave, a boyfriend that isn\u2019t working out) or do you correct it? Do you do neither and deflect the conversation? I had to look after a neighbour with vascular dementia before, and he\u2019d get confused and upset, but nothing like the roiling fear this lady gets.     Many thanks for any advice you could give.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " I work with people who have Alzheimers and I have many tips that either work or won't work at all. The disease is very different for every patient.  What I often find working is to be happy to see them and reassure them, no matter what the mood is they are in. If one of the people I work with come up to me, smiling or in tears, I will always smile at them, use positive words, and tell them it's going to be Okey and I will help them to be safe.  Another thing, which is hard considering Corona, is to get along in their story. Imagine being really confused of what you need to do or where you are and you come up with something (eg. At least I know I need to go to this house) and you get told that even that one thing you know isnt true. That's very frightening. So I'd find a solution to show your neighbor that they did go to a safe place and you are able to help them to some extent. You could just talk to your neighbor while you call her husband on the phone or something like that. Of course idk what your exact situation is.

            " This is called sun downing. The reason they call it that is because the symptomatic behaviour, which she can\u2019t control, happen during the evening.  Usually this involved being \u201cstuck\u201d in a memory. For veterans it\u2019s sometimes the war they fought in (I had a vet patient that would get aggressive or violent because he\u2019d sun down to a war time memory), or a woman sun downs to needing to go to work or being late for work or people who sun down to their teenage years. They literally see themselves as teenagers in the mirror even!!  It can be a difficult behavioural change to deal with, elopement (running off, or what we call a runner, wanderer) behaviour can pair with sun downing, violent or aggressive behaviour can happen, even emotional breakdowns can happen.  Another poster talked about being a part of that story, playing along so to speak. If you can safely do so play along and make HER home the \u201csafety place\u201d, make her husband the safety person.  For example: \u201cOh Sophia! What\u2019s wrong? How can I help?\u201d  Listen to her, engage her then:  \u201cI know exactly what to do Sophia, let me call Ben. He has a safe place for you to go. There is a safe house he has for you to stay at...\u201d  Then call her husband and play the story out. Some people think this is cruel. It\u2019s not, it does a few things. It de-escalates her stress and emotional upset. It helps her get through the sun downing and it creates a safe space in which to redirect her to that is her own husband and household where you will guaranteed her safety with her family. It\u2019s not \u201clying\u201d it\u2019s playing out what her brain wants to work through in its illness in a safe environment with safe people.  The husband needs a nighttime personal support worker is what he needs. Someone who is specially trained in gentle persuasive techniques specific to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (yes there is a course from Alzheimer\u2019s Society called just that and anyone can take the course).  If he cannot find home support it\u2019s time to consider a home that can guarantee her safety and take care of her. Not an easy  decision to make that\u2019s for sure.  Stay calm, speak softly, offer gentle support and play along with the sun downing with the intent to redirect her back to her home.",

    "\n\nHuman: I Randomly Smell Terrible (20M) Let me just start off by saying that I do shower properly and regularly. Also, I talk about suicide here, so if that does you no good, please don't read. Lastly, I'm from the UK, if that matters.  This is an issue that has taken centre stage in my life for the last 5 or so years. I find that randomly, I start to smell. Sometimes like urine, other times like feces and sometimes it resembles the smell of a bin on a very hot day. After doing some research at like 16 years old I was overwhelmed by the stories of people who'd suffered something similar. There were only a handful of medical terms for diseases discussed by them, and I feel as if I fit into none of them. After being rocked with such confusion, and after feeling so damn helpless, I just told myself it was in my head and instead, I consciously distanced myself from everyone. Friends would randomly ask \"did you fart?\" and \"is there a bin around?\" when it flared up, but they didn't completely abandon me, even though I'm sure they realised I was the one smelling. Even as naive as I was and as emotionally underdeveloped I was at 16, I couldn't help but hate myself. In under a 5 month span, I went from a very happy kid with a very healthy social life to whatever beast I am now.  Since then, it's only got worse. I was still telling myself it was in my head, though, as reality was just too scary for me. Now, I feel as though I smell terribly for the majority of the day. It's gotten to a point to where I can tell that my family don't want to be near me. Really, that, with the fact that I will be starting university soon, has made me realise that I must face this head on. After 6 years of losing connection and living like a zombie, I'm ready to hear of what I could be suffering from.  This problem has been the root of essentially all the problems I've faced since I was 15.  From the anxiety, to the suicidal ideation, to the depression and even how awkward I've become. Some nights I find myself wandering of what could've been had I not had this problem, and other nights I think of very violent ways to go out. It's something that I've never wanted to admit was even real, but there's no doubt in my mind that it is real now. What still scares me, though, is the prospect of having to live with this for a long time pushing me to do something stupid. I just can't picture myself living like this for much longer, and to be frank, I think that ending it all is one very plausible conclusion for me.  Some things I've realised js that certain foods makes it flare up worse, and those foods are all either gassy or sugary. Still, though, it feels like no foods are fool-proof. I'm not sure why, but I feel as if it's linked in one way or another to my IBS.   If you're finding it hard to follow my ramblings, I'm sorry. I'm not doing very well mentally right now and it seems like it's having an effect on my ability to write.  Now, what I want to ask is if you guys know of anything I could be suffering from? If so, do you know of how I could get treatment? If not, how do I go about getting any form of help, especially during a pandemic? I feel as this is life or death for me, and I genuinely want to keep living.  Please let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on anything or if you know of any alternative options beside the ones mentioned above.   If you've taken your time to read through all of this, I appreciate it. It feels like a massive weight has been lifted from my shoulders.\n\nAssistant:": {

That is the only way I would be able to make sense of what the smell is and where it is coming from. (This will be tricky in the pandemic). This is to avoid misunderstanding over whether it is subjective or one or a variety of metabolic problems.   Unfortunately for some patients, what may have started as a minor issue results in their becoming highly attuned to odours which may not always be perceived by others.  It is important you speak to your GP about this and be honest about how it is affecting your mental health. It sounds like you need support for that too whilst further assessment of your body odour issue takes place.   In the meantime, is there a family member you can trust to be honest with you when you are worrying about your BO, who can tell you straight whether they are aware of something? That may help you clarify what others can smell and when, to perhaps make some sense of it.   Ironically, aggressive cleaning can make matters worse for some people as it alters the bacteria on the skin, so I suggest use a mild soap/shower gel.

    "\n\nHuman: My close friend thinks she has Chronic Lyme Disease with co-infections, she switched from taking her MS meds to alternative treatments and keeps getting worse. Need advice on how to help her. This one is a bit long, but please bear with me, I wanted to make sure I don't miss any important information that might be insightful.  About 8 years ago I became friends with a lady who told me she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis after she had a fainting episode and then partially lost her vision temporarily, she went to the ER and following medical diagnostics (MRI, tests) was diagnosed with MS. In the next few years she'd share with me her progress/MRI results as she would experience periods of recovery and then relapses/flare-ups. At that time she was very physically active, doing biking events for MS awareness and such. About 4 years ago she began living with my family (to save money on college etc) so at that time I would be able to see her every day; while she'd occasionally have periods of fatigue and difficulty walking, barely noticeable tremors, there was never an occasion that we'd need to help her move/go up the stairs. All this time time she was on MS medications, sometimes switching from one to another, changing dose, etc. Cut to spring of 2020, up until this time she still kept being very physically active, doing workouts/light weight training almost every day at home. She started being unhappy with some of the side effects of her MS medicines (some made her heart beat very fast, some made her face flush red), and I suspect somewhere around this time is when she stopped taking her meds. By summer 2020 I started noticing her tremors became almost always present instead of only occasional, and she started having occasional difficulty walking. By the beginning of fall 2020 those symptoms worsened, we'd almost always help her unload her groceries from her car and bring them home. She could only occasionally do physical exercise. By the end of fall and up until now she could no longer walk without support and would often fall (2-3 times a week). She works from home due to the COVID-19 measures so that works out well, but she almost never leaves the house, has groceries delivered, and sometimes needs help having food brought to her room in order to not spill things because of her tremors.      Now for the CLD part. At one point, I believe in the spring of 2020, she visited an OBGYN and shared her frustration with MS, he suggested she check if she might have Lyme disease. She went ahead and researched online, brought it up with the doctor that was treating her MS, was told that she didn't have Lyme (they may or may not have done the test for that back when she was diagnosed with MS, her retelling of it was confusing, but she believes the test they did had evidence of some infection and the doctors didn't report on it, instead calling it MS. I'm inclined to think they did do the test since we're in an endemic area and it came back negative, but I don't know this for sure). She kept on researching online and discovered the CLD community and what I can only tell is an aggregation of misinformation and faulty research that claims some big pharma and CDC conspiracies about Lyme disease. Reason I know this is she told me about it and also asked me questions about how CDC and FDA operates and what it means if a test is FDA-approved/CDC-recommended (I work in the biotech field and happened to be working on a EUA submission for a test, so had a bit of insight) and most importantly what it means when a test is NOT endorsed by CDC and not FDA approved. Cut to the chase, she went ahead and ordered an IGeneX test for Lyme and co-infections and got a positive result. I looked into the test and found my own concerns with it (56% false positive rate being the biggest one), but since I'm not a doctor I told her to bring the test to one and figure out how to go from there. I don't think she ever went to one, or at least not one that's not \"Lyme literate\" as I found out the term.  I looked into it and as far as I can tell the CLD isn't a recognized diagnosis and people are self-diagnosing themselves with it because doctors can't find what's wrong with them. At one point she claimed she saw \"worms\" in her stool that looked like \"spirochetes\", which, having worked on leptospirosis, obviously baffled me since AFAIK we don't have a microscope in the house, and when I pointed it out she claimed that it was a \"biofilm.\" When I asked how she could tell that she said she saw pictures on the internet. In general, whenever the conversation got to this subject and I would ask legitimate questions about the claims she made she'd turn rather defensive so I decided to avoid asking any more questions.      What worries me is now she wants to go from harmless alternative treatments (scrubbing herself with a loofah before a bath to detox the surface of the skin, taking daily 2 hour salt baths to detox the skin/body, eating garlic to kill bacteria in her blood, taking herbs, vegetarian/vegan diets, drinking crazy amounts of water that send her to the bathroom every 30 mins) to potentially dangerous stuff like long-term intravenous antibiotics. She is only 28, underweight, can't walk without support, I had to lift her off the floor the other day because she fell while getting out of a bath and couldn't get up. I fear she might die, but I realize that if she's in what honestly seems like a cult, no matter what evidence I bring to her I'll get the backfire effect. She doesn't have any relatives in the US and I told her I will help her in any way I can but I cannot support and agree to what as far as I can tell is dangerous misinformation that's making her sicker every day.      I would very much appreciate any and all advice on how to help her. Thank you.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " I have been diagnosed with MS since 1996 and have been very lucky. I know she doesn\u2019t like the meds (a lot of them used to be shots) but there are now a lot of treatment options. I am on Tecfidera (the one that makes you flush and turn red) but if she would have stayed on it it goes away. Interferons also make you feel terrible.  She seems young by your description and it is hard to deal with a permanent diagnosis of something that is basically \u201cwe can help you and give you meds and they help a lot but don\u2019t cure\u201d.  Living with something that you know can change suddenly, you can wake up and not be able to move, be blind etc is terrifying. Also when you have relapses you don\u2019t know how long it will take to get back to baseline or if you will.  My thoughts-she need to go to her neuro and see what is going on. She could be having a flare or if she had a relapsing/remitting diagnosis it could have turned to secondary progressive and she would need a different treatment plan. Also I know she is doing things that are strange and it may be a way for her to feel \u201cin control\u201d of the disease. MS however doesn\u2019t allow you to not take proper care of your body-you will be affected by that. The long baths etc sounds like it could be a little OCD. A psych evaluation may need to be in order. MS can affect moods and also many have underlying depression because of the powerlessness of what may or may not happen.  I would say if you could get her to her neuro that would be good. There could also be a underlying mental issue unrelated to MS. I go on the internet to investigate health things to learn more but it seems like she found a lot of quacks to listen to and is putting her body in danger. Some of this quackery may not be as detrimental to others but it will be to her.  Also the MS Society has support groups that may help her. She could meet with people (I think they are online now) to talk about the side effects of meds, how she feels, the scariness of the diagnosis and well how shitty it can be and the people understand it and they can talk about what works for them or how they deal with it. It is nice to be in a room with others who \u201cget\u201d what you are saying after not anyone you know can fully understand but rather give you sympathy."

            " There are so many problems in that design...   -Needs electricity to fire  -manufacturing 4 accurate bores in one steel stock and rifling them  -feeding ammunition (it looks like 4 rounds at time should be accurate matched to 5 bores)  -Heat issues, 5 bores generating heat while there is only 1/3rd of area to dissipate heat  -accuracy  -caseless ammunition looks really sketchy, how will you manage field reloading, cases look heavy/bulky, possible tolerance issues",
            " I don't understand the \"caseless ammo\" design. In a typical firearm the cartridge case does not need to be strong enough to contain the peak preassure. The chamber does that. In this design the ammo block is the chamber. So now you need to make a disposable item strong enough to contain the preassure. That means carrying around a lot of extra steel. I cannot see how 6 of these blocks can take less space and weight than 1 standard capacity magazine. How can inserting 6 blocks be faster than one magazine?",
            " Alright the video was a big help to clarifying a few things.  The difference between this and a more conventional gun is the ammunition blocks and the multiple bore barrel (there are 5 bores, not 4 like the article states).  Here is my thoughts on the gun:  Ammunition - I imagine the loaded blocks come from the manufacturer loaded otherwise you are playing muzzle loader with 5 small holes in a block.  I cannot conceive how this is more convenient than magazines loaded with bullets. Anyone can load a current magazine with given a bullet.  You run out of blocks, you ran out of luck.  i don't know the dimensions but it doesn't seem like 6 blocks would take up that much less room than a magazine.  Plus there is a lot of excess material in the blocks and being steel, it's probably heavier than a magazine as well.  Firing mechanism - From the looks, I am guessing the \"electrical actuator\" is a solenoid hooked up to essentially a small spark plug.  It set's off the charge in the back of the ammo blocks.  I am not sure revolutionary is the right wording.  Multiple barrels - If they group up so tight I am not sure what the advantage is going to be.  Regardless of the barrel count you either miss or hit.  Are 5 6mm rounds better than 1 5.56mm round?  I guess you can use the other 4 if one plugs but why not focus on a more robust, single barrel gun then?  With seemingly little to no advantage, the only factor is cost in which a 5 bore barrel with a specialized technique is going to be crazy expensive.   Also note, in the video they did showed the gun shooting but not actuating to the next block.  I don't think they have figured that part out yet (or it's an old video and they have). If they are targeting 250 rnds/sec (guessing the actuator cycle time is 50 hertz) it would have to be a stiff ass spring or a new revolutionary mechanism (can't motor drive it).  This will be unpractical for loading purposes (try to push a block in against that beast would suck) and I don't know how you would put an actuating mechanical stop in place to prevent all the blocks just slumping out the side of the gun.    Last but not least, why load out the side?  There is a reason modern guns have magazines load from below.  Try to turn a corner with a foot long box sticking out the side of the gun.  Bringing the Sten back I guess.  This dude's conclusion: Interesting idea but isn't going to make it anywhere (in this package).  I am guessing the military is more interested in the firing mechanism than the gun.  It would be a pretty big deal to switch to electronic firing mechanisms in current models as it would remove the primer and mechanical mechanisms needed to strike it on modern guns.  That would reduce production costs for ammunition and conceivably remove failure concerns with the actuator if they are plug n' play.  Although it would suck to get in a fire fight and need to change the batteries.",

            " I'm not a historian, I'm just a mathematician, but I have a few candidates.  In particular, there are three points in time I think would be significant enough for a 'before/after' era distinction.   * The invention of 0.  0 is a vital notion in mathematics. It represents one of the first, most basic  abstractions we encounter. It naturally leads to the invention of useful concepts like negative numbers. It's vital in the analysis of... well... everything. Part of the reason for that is that 0 captures the notion of 'doing nothing' to something, the idea of 'identity'.  As far as I've learned -- it was the Indian's who invented 0 around 975CE.   * The year the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic was first proved.  Primes are the most important class of number, period. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is of vital importance in number theory. I won't go into massive detail, but suffice that Multiplicative, Integer Number Theory is basically all either consequences of this theorem, or theorems in service of the proof of this theorem. It's a sort of 'theory of everything' for multiplication.   It was initially proved by Euclid in *The Elements*, but I would say that Gauss' proof in 1801CE is more rigorous and more useful, and I'd use that.   * The Proof of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem  Godel's Incompleteness Theorem represents a sea-change in how we think about mathematics. Up until that point, Mathematics had been questioning it's foundations, and desperately seeking a fundamental set of axioms which represented a foundation for all mathematics. These efforts culminated in Russel's Type Theory, a theory so wrapped up in formalism that it took three and a half pages for it to prove `2+2=4`. Godel proved that even this best hope for a foundation of mathematics would never be sufficient to prove every possible theorem. Godel's proof shows that in any sufficiently powerful axiomatic system, there are some true theorems which are unprovable. This simple, 20ish page proof changed our motivations in mathematics. It was no longer a rush to the bottom, but rather a rush to new fields, with foundational connections seen as a tool, rather than as a target, of mathematics.  Godel proved these theorems in 1931CE.  -----------------------------------------------  Part of my reasoning for choosing those dates is that each section represents a shift in our mathematical maturity. From the Inception of Mathematics near the dawn of civilization, we treated the entirety of mathematics in a very mechanistic, mystical way -- each question was considered on it's own, with no connection between problems that we now regard as fundamentally the same. The essence was Arithmetic without Abstraction. It served for a while, but the invention of 0 can really be seen as the invention of the first purely abstract mathematical concept. There is no 'nothing' which is concrete to hold on to. There is only the idea of nothing. We might call the time leading up to the invention of zero the 'Mathematics as Concretion' era, and the time after as 'Mathematics as Abstraction' phase.  The next change is a distinction of rigor, before Gauss and the FToA, Mathematics was a discovery-oriented 'intuition'-based system. The notion of proof was there, but it was by no means designed for rigor. FToA marks the turning point where rigor becomes the name of the mathematical game, and this in turn increases the ability to be abstract -- because it doesn't matter how little intuition you can bring to bear -- it's only the logical artifacts that 'matter' in the sense of mathematics. Technically, this change started before the previous era distinction, so it's somewhat inappropriate to combine the two divisions, but if I can take the license, I'd say that this distinguishes itself from the \"Age of Mathematical Abstraction\" and becomes the \"Age of Mathematical Rigor\".  Finally, Godel. Godel's proof represents the synthesis of the previous two ages. After 0 and before FToA, Mathematics was about intuition, exploration, and acquisition of new ideas and techniques. After FToA, mathematics got a bit gunshy on the exploration front. We ran back to cover ourselves from our now obvious lack of rigor. We re-built Euclidean Geometry, uncovering deficits of reason which built new subfields, but curiously in the 150 years between FToA and Incompleteness, only a handful of _brand new_ fields were really created. Most of the new systems were specifications and rigorizations of existing ideas. Algebra became a suite of systems which dealt with axiomatic structure of equations. Analysis and Number Theory became axiomatic explorations of continuity and convergence. Topology is probably the closest thing to 'new' in this period, and it is really a sort of amalgam of Algebra and Geometry and Analysis. Ultimately this 'rigor panic' lead to the idea that all mathematics must flow from one fundamental source of axioms. These were the building blocks, and if we could see them, we could somehow finally have some modicum of peace and get back to the exploring -- a hopeless dream, we knew we'd never be satisfied with any one set of axioms, no matter how obvious. Godel shot this idea out of the water. He proved, conclusively, that no finite set of axioms could ever support the weight of an infinite mathematics. He, in one stroke, told everyone what they least wanted to hear, and most needed to know -- mathematics is not perfectly rigorous, there will always need to be new blocks added to the foundation, and it was okay -- that was how mathematics had to work. His work not only saved us from a futile and endless rush to the bottom of mathematics, but also (essentially) founded the first truly new field since before FToA and the onset of the Rigorous Age. He invented Metamathematics -- a rigorous exploration of abstract mathematical systems. With this he ushered in what we might call the \"Age of Mathematical Exploration\" -- dozens of new fields popped up, and helped solve age old problems. We live in this age now, Mathematics is about exploring new things and using those old foundational tools (things like Set Theory and ~~Category Theory~~ Universal Algebra and Type Theory[1] and so on) to help translate ideas between fields, but we no longer regard those tools as the 'point' of mathematics. Godel's proof taught us that the point of mathematics was simply to explore new abstractions, ideas, and ways of thought. That's why -- if nothing else, I think his change deserves a marker in time, it's when Mathematics grew up, and arguably -- we've done more mathematics in the last 80 some-odd years then in the thousand before it.  Mark my words, after the prime number signals come from the aliens, the first question they'll ask is \"Have you found a foundation for all mathematics yet?\" -- We'll say \"No, we found there can't be one\" and they'll look at us and say, \"Good, we didn't land to early then.

The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is of vital importance in number theory. I won't go into massive detail, but suffice that Multiplicative, Integer Number Theory is basically all either consequences of this theorem, or theorems in service of the proof of this theorem. It's a sort of 'theory of everything' for multiplication.   It was initially proved by Euclid in *The Elements*, but I would say that Gauss' proof in 1801CE is more rigorous and more useful, and I'd use that.   * The Proof of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem  Godel's Incompleteness Theorem represents a sea-change in how we think about mathematics. Up until that point, Mathematics had been questioning it's foundations, and desperately seeking a fundamental set of axioms which represented a foundation for all mathematics. These efforts culminated in Russel's Type Theory, a theory so wrapped up in formalism that it took three and a half pages for it to prove `2+2=4`. Godel proved that even this best hope for a foundation of mathematics would never be sufficient to prove every possible theorem. Godel's proof shows that in any sufficiently powerful axiomatic system, there are some true theorems which are unprovable. This simple, 20ish page proof changed our motivations in mathematics. It was no longer a rush to the bottom, but rather a rush to new fields, with foundational connections seen as a tool, rather than as a target, of mathematics.  Godel proved these theorems in 1931CE.  -----------------------------------------------  Part of my reasoning for choosing those dates is that each section represents a shift in our mathematical maturity. From the Inception of Mathematics near the dawn of civilization, we treated the entirety of mathematics in a very mechanistic, mystical way -- each question was considered on it's own, with no connection between problems that we now regard as fundamentally the same. The essence was Arithmetic without Abstraction. It served for a while, but the invention of 0 can really be seen as the invention of the first purely abstract mathematical concept. There is no 'nothing' which is concrete to hold on to. There is only the idea of nothing. We might call the time leading up to the invention of zero the 'Mathematics as Concretion' era, and the time after as 'Mathematics as Abstraction' phase.  The next change is a distinction of rigor, before Gauss and the FToA, Mathematics was a discovery-oriented 'intuition'-based system. The notion of proof was there, but it was by no means designed for rigor. FToA marks the turning point where rigor becomes the name of the mathematical game, and this in turn increases the ability to be abstract -- because it doesn't matter how little intuition you can bring to bear -- it's only the logical artifacts that 'matter' in the sense of mathematics. Technically, this change started before the previous era distinction, so it's somewhat inappropriate to combine the two divisions, but if I can take the license, I'd say that this distinguishes itself from the \"Age of Mathematical Abstraction\" and becomes the \"Age of Mathematical Rigor\".  Finally, Godel. Godel's proof represents the synthesis of the previous two ages. After 0 and before FToA, Mathematics was about intuition, exploration, and acquisition of new ideas and techniques. After FToA, mathematics got a bit gunshy on the exploration front. We ran back to cover ourselves from our now obvious lack of rigor. We re-built Euclidean Geometry, uncovering deficits of reason which built new subfields, but curiously in the 150 years between FToA and Incompleteness, only a handful of _brand new_ fields were really created. Most of the new systems were specifications and rigorizations of existing ideas. Algebra became a suite of systems which dealt with axiomatic structure of equations. Analysis and Number Theory became axiomatic explorations of continuity and convergence. Topology is probably the closest thing to 'new' in this period, and it is really a sort of amalgam of Algebra and Geometry and Analysis. Ultimately this 'rigor panic' lead to the idea that all mathematics must flow from one fundamental source of axioms. These were the building blocks, and if we could see them, we could somehow finally have some modicum of peace and get back to the exploring -- a hopeless dream, we knew we'd never be satisfied with any one set of axioms, no matter how obvious. Godel shot this idea out of the water. He proved, conclusively, that no finite set of axioms could ever support the weight of an infinite mathematics. He, in one stroke, told everyone what they least wanted to hear, and most needed to know -- mathematics is not perfectly rigorous, there will always need to be new blocks added to the foundation, and it was okay -- that was how mathematics had to work. His work not only saved us from a futile and endless rush to the bottom of mathematics, but also (essentially) founded the first truly new field since before FToA and the onset of the Rigorous Age. He invented Metamathematics -- a rigorous exploration of abstract mathematical systems. With this he ushered in what we might call the \"Age of Mathematical Exploration\" -- dozens of new fields popped up, and helped solve age old problems. We live in this age now, Mathematics is about exploring new things and using those old foundational tools (things like Set Theory and ~~Category Theory~~ Universal Algebra and Type Theory[1] and so on) to help translate ideas between fields, but we no longer regard those tools as the 'point' of mathematics. Godel's proof taught us that the point of mathematics was simply to explore new abstractions, ideas, and ways of thought. That's why -- if nothing else, I think his change deserves a marker in time, it's when Mathematics grew up, and arguably -- we've done more mathematics in the last 80 some-odd years then in the thousand before it.  Mark my words, after the prime number signals come from the aliens, the first question they'll ask is \"Have you found a foundation for all mathematics yet?\" -- We'll say \"No, we found there can't be one\" and they'll look at us and say, \"Good, we didn't land to early then.

    "\n\nHuman: In 1892 the US Army chose the Norwegian Krag-Jorgensen as its new service rifle, causing outrage from American companies. By 1907 it was replaced ostensibly over its poor performance in the war with Spain. Was this true or an exaggeration in order to replace the Krag with an American design? The US Army adopted the Krag-Jorgensen in 1892 after holding a competition in which it beat out several other domestic and foreign designs (including several entered by Mauser.)After the competition, two US designers sued the US government over the selection forcing a review of the testing. Once again the Krag won the competition and was confirmed as the selection.   Fast forward to 1898 and the American operation to capture the city of Santiago de Cuba from its Spanish defenders. The outnumbered Spanish were dug in and well fortified on the high ground outside of the city. Most famously atop San Juan and Kettle Hill. The US Army took the Spanish positions following a frontal assault and suffered high casualties.   An Army board of investigation concluded that the high casualties were the result of the Spanish Mauser rifles being far superior to the Krag-Jorgensens carried by US soldiers. While most of the regular US soldiers were armed with Krags many were not. Indeed, the *Buffalo Soldiers* of the all-Black 10th Cavalry (who led the charge up Kettle Hill) appear to have been armed with antiquated black-powder, single shot Trapdoor Springfield rifles. The American artillery was similarly inferior to the more modern cannons employed by the Spanish.   Considering the inferiority of other weapons in American use during the war, the direct assault uphill on an entrenched enemy and the notoriously political (and at times blatantly corrupt) nature of weapons procurement contracts during that era, was the Krag scapegoated in order to get it replaced? While the 1893 Mauser was superior to the Krag, I doubt the difference was so great as to necessitate the cost of replacement after so recently having adopted it. Not to mention the Mausers used by the Spanish (or a closely related design) was entered into the contest by Mauser and lost out to the Krag. The design was good enough that the Norwegian and Danish Armed Forces (with necessary updates over time) continued to use them as their standard issue rifles through the end of WWII. Although they would likely have less resources to replace the rifles than the US Army did, this was still 60+ years since its first adoption by the Danes in 1889.  **So, was the American Krag as outclassed by the Spanish Mausers as is commonly claimed or was its downfall a politically motivated attempt to get a domestic made replacement by people that never wanted it adopted in the first place?**\n\nAssistant:": {

            " Although I can't speak for the exact motivations of the Ordnance Department, I can say that the Krag absolutely was an obsolescent design that warranted replacement for a variety of reasons. The magazine design precluded the use of speed loading devices, the design was complicated and expensive to manufacture, and, most critically, it had a comparatively weak bolt with a single locking block. That last point played in pretty critically with the ammunition. 30-40 Krag was an obsolescent cartridge even for the time, barely reaching 2,000 fps with ammunition at the time - even with the long barrels the infantry rifles were using. Compare this to the 7x57mm Mauser, which was pushing a bullet around 2500 fps, resulting in a much flatter trajectory that had a lot of practical impact when it came to shooting at more distant targets. Although 7x57 Mauser had a lighter bullet, such velocities weren't impossible with heavier bullets, with Spitzer-bullet 8mm Mauser coming in at around 2700 fps.  So the Ordnance Department tried to fix this by developing \"hotter\" loads for 30-40 Krag. The cartridge was capable of it - trials would push the round to 2300 fps, though not on the Krag. That's because of the inherent failings of the Krag's design. The single locking block on the bolt made it inadequate for the kinds of pressures that would be produced by the cartridge the Ordnance Department was looking at. The 30-03 cartridge that would result from these trials would get a 220 grain bullet going 2200 fps at pressures the Krag was never going to be able to handle.  From there, further failings made the adoption of a new rifle seem more reasonable. The 30-40 Krag also suffered from issues with the large rims of the cartridge, which complicated loading and could lead to malfunctions due to rimlock. There existed methods to avoid rimlock (see the Mosin), but adoption of a rimless cartridge avoids those issues entirely and ends up being simpler. And while redesigning the Krag to handle a rimless cartridge would largely be a question of replacing the bolt, with the gun itself proving itself unable to handle the pressures produced by the kind of cartridge the Army wanted, we have yet another reason to go against the Krag.  Finally, there's the magazine. The Krag's magazine was a problem for a variety of reasons. Even if we ignore its unique shape, the inability to handle speed-loading devices was a major shortcoming. Army experiments leading up to the 1903 also reveal other concerns, primarily over magazine durability. This is actually an issue not exclusive to the Krag. The Ordnance department (as with many other armies all over the world) had concerns over protruding magazines being easily damaged, so they were looking for a system that was flush fit. And with the Spanish Model 1893 Mausers as a nice good example, they had a system that did everything they were looking for. The magazine was significantly simpler and more compact than that of the Krag while also being able to accept stripper clips.  &#x200B;  All that being said, you bring up valid points, and it's not exactly out of character for the Ordnance Department to make nonsensical decisions with poor reasoning. In this case, however, we have similar instances to show that these decisions have a decent chance of being made in good faith. The British had a similar experience in the Boer War, where they felt outclassed by the flatter-shooting 7mm Mauser cartridge - in their case developing a standardized \"short\" rifle and adding a charger guide to address their biggest complaints during the war. Germany's adoption of the Gewehr 98 offers a similar situation with the replacement of a recently adopted but sub-par rifle. The American experience here seems to be a mix of both of these situations - the Krag was recognized as being underperforming in the Spanish-American War, but the Ordnance Department determined a new design was more conducive to their new requirements than their existing rifles.",

I was at work and I was putting away the clean linen in the linen closet and as I'm cleaning up I see something on one of the clean sheets. I look and it's a bug, I snapped a few pics and googled around a bit. It's 100% a bed bug. I told my manager and she said nope not a bed bug, then took the dead bug and that's it. I asked her if she was going to tell anyone or do anything about it and she said \"no, because it wasn't a bed bug\".

    "\n\nHuman: I (24M) am being harassed at work (80M) and am not sure how to handle it professionally. I work at a nonprofit organization in Texas doing fundraising and donor relationship management among other things. We don't really have a HR department. I'm new to the field, and it's kind of a dream job (or at least a step on the way to a better dream job), so I am not sure how to deal with some things and have probably made a few missteps that have led me to where I am. Regardless, I'd like some advice on how to deal with this without quitting or burning bridges.  I started at a musuem last year and was introduced to a man in his 80s who donates a fair amount of folk art to the museum. Nothing ground-breaking, but he's been doing this for quite a while and has developed a relationship with the org and a friendship with our founding director. When I started, I just thought he was a friendly but crass old man who was maybe a little touchy or that there was a generational gap in understandings of professionalism/appropriateness. I would receive the occasional \"Forwards from Grandpa\" type email with a dirty joke every once in a while, but the relationship quickly crossed a physical line, ie grabbing my hand and holding me uncomfortably close during a handshake, too much touching on my back, comments on my figure or how my clothes fit (I like to keep in shape and am typically well-dressed at work), to a strange amount of him giving me things like old clothes, folk art, or magazines, which I would usually just accept graciously but throw away or donate to Goodwill once he left. I was uncomfortable about it but I also know I can be a very reserved and private person and wanted to be optimistic about it, as it is my job to keep donors happy.   Around Christmas, he invited me to stay at his apartment while he was away, and I tried to politely decline, and he asked if my email was monitored, which I ignored. At a opening reception, he got drunk and openly admitted to me that he knows exactly what he's doing in harassing me, knows that I hate and am made uncomfortable by his comments and actions, and mentioned that he loves to flirt with me simply because he can. this really upset me because my suspicions that he uses his status and \"nice old man\" persona to be a predator. When I had enough and mentioned this to some of the senior employees they basically said \"it's ____, what do you expect? I'm just glad he's not focusing on me any longer\" and discouraged me from bringing it up to our director. I'm not sure if the director is aware of it but I'm also not sure how they wouldn't be at this point. There have been other creepy things he's done since but you get the picture.   What should I do? I've tried keeping a professional arm's length since, or introducing him to my girlfriend but it's just getting worse. I don't want to damage the relationship the org has with him because it's my job to preserve these kinds of giving relationships but I'm kind of at my wit's end with the creepiness and intentional harassment. I figured initially I'd just put up with it until Father Time took care of business but I'd rather stand up for myself at this point.  TL;DR: friendly old donor at non-profit turns out to be creepy and i am not sure how to handle it professionally Location: Texas, USA.\n\nAssistant:": {

            " You're kind of a rock and a hard place, but I think you should definitely discuss it with your Director.  You're in a role not a whole lot different from a salesperson, or even a Hooters waitress.  Part of your job, and the way to be successful at your job, is to being friendly with people.  And in some cases - perhaps too many - that's going to mean being friendly with people who you wouldn't otherwise be friendly with, and possibly even with people who outright repulse you.  You can only decide for yourself how far you're willing to go with that.  Certainly personal security would be a reasonable boundary (and a good reason to turn down the offer to stay at his apartment), but it doesn't sound like this 80 year old dude is actually a physical threat to you.  So I think you need to bring your Director up to speed and get direction / approval from them on how you approach it.  From what I can see, there's only 4 reasonable possibilities:  1. Too bad.  Suck it up.  It's part of the job and you better not screw up the relationship with this donor because we count on him too much to lose his money because you can't flirt with him a little bit (you can interpret this response as your employer basically asking you to be a low-key prostitute).  2. We're going to fix this by having someone else handle this donor.  You shouldn't have any significant interaction with him going forward.  (Solves *your* problem, but probably doesn't solve *the* problem).  3. Wow.  That's not really acceptable, but he's an important funder to our organization.  Do your best to preserve the relationship while also enforcing your own personal boundaries.  If that causes him to stop funding us, then so be it.  We'll support you and we've got your back.  (Pretty much solves the problem, but puts it on you to balance the needs of the organization and your personal needs).  4. WTF?  Are you serious.  Let me call him and tell him that we're no longer interested in having him affiliated with our organization in any manner whatsoever.  There's other donors out there, and we'll go find them.  (Seems to solve the problem).  Options 2, 3 and 4 are probably options you can live with even if 2 and 3 aren't ideal.  What you really need to be prepared for is what your response will be if your Director suggests Option #1.",

    "\n\nHuman: [FL] Does refusing to meet with HR and/or sign disciplinary documentation leave me in a worse situation? Long story short, I wrote up a 92 page approval document on and off over the last 2 weeks. This morning, a coworker says she accidentally deleted (I don't know how that is possible) the files for the approval document in the shared drive. I ask IT to retrieve the documents and they said they couldn't even though I have a copy of an email from IT from several months ago when I first started that they can retrieve deleted files from the shared drive.  As far as I am concerned, this mess isn't of my making. Thus, the onus falls on my coworker and on IT. I informed my boss of the situation and that since I didn't create this mess, I'm not going to fix it. Instead, I will continue with my other assignments. If they want the work to be redone, then have the one who deleted it redo the work.  Now I've received a meeting invite to talk with HR which I've declined and I have the feeling they will write me up. I plan to refuse any meetings with HR and refuse to sign any documentation. Does doing so leave me in a better, worse, or no different situation?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " It depends which philosophical tradition you most sympathise with. If you follow Rousseau, who said \"man is born free but is everywhere in chains\", you may believe our current system stymies our native dignity and autonomy and perhaps amounts to a form of slavery. If you follow Hobbes, who believed the state of nature (i.e., what came before this 'system we've created'), condemns us to a life that is \"nasty, poor, brutish, short\", then you would probably view having a job as an opportunity to participate in a system that allows us a better quality of life, and therefore not slavery but something that is willingly participated in. The distinction can also be characterised in terms of negative vs positive freedom. Read Berlin on negative and Taylor or Miller on positive. Do you believe \"freedom from\" or \"freedom to\" is more important? If freedom from, you're more in line with Rousseau, if freedom to, you're more in line with Hobbes.",

Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels *Manifesto of the Communist Party*:  >Modern Industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist. Masses of labourers, crowded into the factory, are organised like soldiers. As privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants. Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, by the overlooker, and, above all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself. The more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more embittering it is.  French journalist Simon Linguet (quoted by Karl Marx in *Theories of Surplus Value*):  >\u201cIt is the impossibility of living by any other means that compels our farm labourers to till the soil whose fruits they will not eat, and our masons to construct buildings in which they will not live.  It is want that drags them to those markets where they await masters who will do them the kindness of buying them.  It is want that compels them to go down on their knees to the rich man in order to get from him permission to enrich him\u201d (p. 274).  >\u201cViolence, then, has been the first cause of society, and force the first bond that held it together\u201d (p. 302).  The idea of wage labor being similar to slavery is big in the socialist tradition and especially Marxism. A pre-requisite for capitalism was forcing a majority of the population into a position where they can only survive by selling their labor-power as a commodity. Since your labor-power (your potential to add value in the form of labor) can only be measured in time, you essentially are force to sell yourself as a commodity for agreed upon periods of time.   >The value of labour-power is determined, as in the case of every other commodity, by the labour-time necessary for the production, and consequently also the reproduction, of this special article.  (*Capital vol, 1*)  >The demand for men necessarily governs the production of men, as of every other commodity. Should supply greatly exceed demand, a section of the workers sinks into beggary or starvation. The worker\u2019s existence is thus brought under the same condition as the existence of every other commodity. The worker has become a commodity, and it is a bit of luck for him if he can find a buyer.  (*1844 Manuscripts*)",
            " Needing to work for a living surely isn\u2019t slavery. Barring having the robots do everything, there is no society at all in which no humans work. Identifying the need to work with slavery trivializes it.  But I think you\u2019re really asking about a situation in which you have limited choice about your occupation  and the conditions under which you work. Central to the concept of slavery is ownership of a person. So, are you the property of your employer if you have limited choice about your occupation and conditions of labor. I\u2019m inclined to say that even if your options were limited to a single job, so long as you were able to leave work at the end of your shift and able to do as you wish free from interference by your employer, at least until your next shift begins, then the employee-employer relationship is not one of slavery.  That said, we may legitimately criticize that relationship as exploitative, and on that grounds work to change the conditions of labor. But it\u2019s not slavery except in a metaphorical sense.",

            " It depends which philosophical tradition you most sympathise with. If you follow Rousseau, who said \"man is born free but is everywhere in chains\", you may believe our current system stymies our native dignity and autonomy and perhaps amounts to a form of slavery. If you follow Hobbes, who believed the state of nature (i.e., what came before this 'system we've created'), condemns us to a life that is \"nasty, poor, brutish, short\", then you would probably view having a job as an opportunity to participate in a system that allows us a better quality of life, and therefore not slavery but something that is willingly participated in. The distinction can also be characterised in terms of negative vs positive freedom. Read Berlin on negative and Taylor or Miller on positive. Do you believe \"freedom from\" or \"freedom to\" is more important? If freedom from, you're more in line with Rousseau, if freedom to, you're more in line with Hobbes.",
            " Needing to work for a living surely isn\u2019t slavery. Barring having the robots do everything, there is no society at all in which no humans work. Identifying the need to work with slavery trivializes it.  But I think you\u2019re really asking about a situation in which you have limited choice about your occupation  and the conditions under which you work. Central to the concept of slavery is ownership of a person. So, are you the property of your employer if you have limited choice about your occupation and conditions of labor. I\u2019m inclined to say that even if your options were limited to a single job, so long as you were able to leave work at the end of your shift and able to do as you wish free from interference by your employer, at least until your next shift begins, then the employee-employer relationship is not one of slavery.  That said, we may legitimately criticize that relationship as exploitative, and on that grounds work to change the conditions of labor. But it\u2019s not slavery except in a metaphorical sense.",

            " Hmm.. so we have a heavy object that id hard to push because of high friction. The first thing to realize is that the reason friction is high is that the object is heavy.  If friction was high due to the coefficient of friction, then we could probably just lift the object and we wouldnt be talking about friction. (Of course both could be high.. I dont know we can talk about that later.)   So, the object is heavy. The normal force has a lsrge magnitude. If you want to reduce friction, you will have to reduce normal force. The only way to do this is to lift directly upward. If you can do that, then your idea will work.. also note.. unless there is some kind of handle, actually performing this maneuver would be had. Try this with a heavy box of books.   But its likely you wont be able to do that. If an object is heavy.. we can often only move it by applying leverage.. by tipping the object.. rotating it up onto an edge. This wont decrease the normal force, it will just concentrate it at the surface that remains in contact. Since you didnt reduce normal force, you didnt reduce friction.  So what you need is a way to lift directly upward.  At work I use ziplines to do exactly this. We wrap opbects with straps attached to pulleys that run in what we call high lines (look a lot like zip lines,  rope up in air). When we tenaion that line it puts upward force on the object. It may bot be enough to lift the object, but it reduces the force of friction so that we can slide it easier. It also helps us pivot the object up and over or around obstacles that we cant move)",
            " **Tl;dr.** The distribution of force should be angled *arctan(mu)* above the horizontal plane where mu is the friction coefficient of the floor.  (Sorry I rarely post so I don't know how to make variables look nice. Please bear with me).   First we can quickly reason from experience that it has to depend on the frictional coefficient of the floor.  Let's imagine the extremes. If the floor was ice, then we know from experience we should just push and likewise if the floor was glue we know to pick it up and then move it.   Great. Now let's formalize it. First let's generalize the problem. Imagine a string pulling on the object at some angle between horizontal (0) and straight up (90). Let's call this angle Theta. And we'll imagine we can only apply F force in total (the total strength of the two people). Thus in your title you were describing the case where Theta is either 0 or 45.   The math is pretty short. We'll write our forces in terms of Theta. The upward pulling force of the string is F * sin(theta) and the horizontal pulling F * cos(theta) (since F is the hypotenuse these follow directly from the definitions of sin and cos). This makes the friction force easy to calculate. The weight of the object is now (mass * gravity - F sin(theta)) since you're pulling up, and  we just multiply by the friction coefficient mu (u) to get the force of friction: u(m * g - F * sin(theta)).  So our pulling force is F * cos(theta)  and the resisting force is u * m * g - u * F * sin(theta). So overall our object is moving with force F*cos(theta)* - u * m * g + u * F *sin(theta)*.  Now we want to maximize this with respect to Theta as a function of u. We'll take its derivative and set it to zero.   The derivative is -F*sin(theta)* + u * F*cos(theta)*. And set to zero, the F's cancel out, and we get u = sin(theta) / cos(theta) = tan(theta). Thus Theta = arctan(u).  Let's verify it real quick. If we were on ice, mu would be close to 0 and arctan of 0 is 0 degrees which means both people should just push forward. Perfect! And if mu was really high we get closer and closer to 90 degrees so it lines up with our intuition! Hope this was clear and helps you solve similar problems!  (If someone has tips on formatting, that would be greatly appreciated)",

(Sorry I rarely post so I don't know how to make variables look nice. Please bear with me).   First we can quickly reason from experience that it has to depend on the frictional coefficient of the floor.  Let's imagine the extremes. If the floor was ice, then we know from experience we should just push and likewise if the floor was glue we know to pick it up and then move it.   Great. Now let's formalize it. First let's generalize the problem. Imagine a string pulling on the object at some angle between horizontal (0) and straight up (90). Let's call this angle Theta. And we'll imagine we can only apply F force in total (the total strength of the two people). Thus in your title you were describing the case where Theta is either 0 or 45.   The math is pretty short. We'll write our forces in terms of Theta. The upward pulling force of the string is F * sin(theta) and the horizontal pulling F * cos(theta) (since F is the hypotenuse these follow directly from the definitions of sin and cos). This makes the friction force easy to calculate. The weight of the object is now (mass * gravity - F sin(theta)) since you're pulling up, and  we just multiply by the friction coefficient mu (u) to get the force of friction: u(m * g - F * sin(theta)).  So our pulling force is F * cos(theta)  and the resisting force is u * m * g - u * F * sin(theta). So overall our object is moving with force F*cos(theta)* - u * m * g + u * F *sin(theta)*.  Now we want to maximize this with respect to Theta as a function of u. We'll take its derivative and set it to zero.   The derivative is -F*sin(theta)* + u * F*cos(theta)*. And set to zero, the F's cancel out, and we get u = sin(theta) / cos(theta) = tan(theta). Thus Theta = arctan(u).  Let's verify it real quick. If we were on ice, mu would be close to 0 and arctan of 0 is 0 degrees which means both people should just push forward. Perfect! And if mu was really high we get closer and closer to 90 degrees so it lines up with our intuition! Hope this was clear and helps you solve similar problems!  (If someone has tips on formatting, that would be greatly appreciated)",
        "rejected_target": " I agree with /u/JangusKhan.  You can only halve the friction force if you can half-lift the object, in which case it's probably better if the two of you carry it off the ground together."

    "\n\nHuman: If the Hamiltonian generates time evolution, and there is no absolute time in relativity, what role does the Hamiltonian have in relativistic quantum Dynamics? I want to give a really brief overview of quantum dynamics to some math people in preparation for motivating a paper we will read.

    "\n\nHuman: Does telling a child that they have to finish all their food, even if they're full, predispose them to being overweight or obese? I feel like so many parents are always telling their children \"One more bite before you can leave the table\" or something along those lines. I'm not talking about finishing your vegetables, but just food (even an unhealthy dinner). The thought process seems to be that they think their child isn't eating enough to grow. But as adults, we're always told to eat until we're full. So why do we teach our children they're doing a good job if they eat past satiety; won't they naturally eat enough food to support their own growth?\n\nAssistant:": {

            " The current theory being taught in nutrition classes is based on the \"division of responsibility\" theory by Ellyn Satter. This states that children naturally develop their own relationships with food, hunger, and fullness over time and the parents need to recognize their roles in feeding vs the child's. As infants and young children parents are to provide what kind of food and a variety that they feel comfortable with their child eating and the child will choose which of the options and how much they will eat. Naturally developing a sense of satiety is very important to prevent the over eating that then has to be corrected as adults. Schedules can make this more difficult for many people and the urge to make your child eat all their vegetables is very strong with most parents, but if your child is hungry for more pasta and not more broccoli then that is what their body wants.",

            " For honeybees, it\u2019s programmed in. They all follow the same rules when they\u2019re building cooperatively, and things mostly work out.  The only thing we know bees learn is foraging behavior. They learn the hive location, and other bees teach them where to find food through their dance language.",
            " Bee and Spider constructions are based entirely on instinct.  The animals are born knowing the behavior needed to construct the habitat, and do it properly right from the start. Birds are more complicated: the behavior is instinctive but has learned components. Humans have examples of both kinds of behaviors, but not with regards to building physical constructions.  To go into more detail:  Spider webs are formed in a distinct step of stages.  For example, for orb weavers produce a web in a distinct series of stages that they follow in an almost robotic manner.  Even  more irregular-looking \"cobweb\" webs are actually constructed according to a regular pattern of behavior. link.  The spider follows the set of actions in order and produces a web, there isn't a lot of flexibility to adapt this behavior to changing situations...for example damage to the web may result in the whole thing being torn down and rebuilt rather than a simple repair being made.    Bee behavior is also instinctive, but beehives are a result of many interacting individuals exhibiting simple behavior.  For example, the hexagonal packing of beehive cells is a result of individual bees attempting to build circular cells as close together as possible, using their body size to determine cell size.  But if you try to make a series of circles packed in as tight as possible and sharing walls, what you get is hexagons.  Bird nests get more interesting because they provide an example of a kind of learning which combines with instinct (note a caveat, there are a lot of birds and they build a lot of kinds of nests and the following isn't exactly the same for all of them).  In short: birds don't need to be taught to build a nest.  When they are in a nesting mood they naturally begin to gather the materials needed for a nest and arrange them into a nestlike form, even if they've never seen a nest before.  But...they aren't necessarily _good_ at it.  Especially with more complex nests, as they build nests again and again they gain practice.  The basic instinct is there but learning helps it develop into full form link  Now what about humans?  Humans have a number of purely instinctive behaviors.  A good example is the nursing instinct in infants.  Plop an infant on skin and it will instinctively begin moving its head around in a side to side motion called \"rooting\".  If it finds a projection it will grab on and start sucking.  This sequence of behavioral steps is not, in principle, all that different from the more complex series of steps that causes a spider to build a spider web.  In general these kinds of instinctive behaviors are called \"Fixed Action Patterns\" and generally are responding to some stimulus, and have actions that always happen the same way and in the same order.    Bird nest construction, on the other hand, is more like human instincts such as walking. A human is born with the underlying instincts needed to learn to walk; if you dangle an infant over the ground it will move its legs in a walking pattern.  And there's a behavioral drive to reach the end goal (moving around successfully and upright).  But the intermediate steps (if you will) have to be learned.  The instinctive leg-moving motion has to be refined into a balanced and precise series of motions, and this happens through learning.",

        "sft_target": " This is such a fascinating topic! The short answer is, for the most part, yes. To an extent, building these structures seems hard wired into the animals. However, there's evidence that certain aspects of these behaviors may be learned as well. For example, birds of the same species will build the same structure of nest. Additionally, birds raised in captivity with little to no interaction with conspecifics will build nests with the only difference being those nests are of a lower quality than that of birds in the wild.   Spiders and their webs are fascinating case studies on innate behavior. There's been a number of experiments on how chemical substances affect spider web building. Like birds, spiders of the same species will build the same web structure. Not to mention, there's at least one parasitic species of wasp whose larvae hijacks the spider's web building behavior, forcing it to create a cocoon as the larvae feeds on the spider, by \"overriding\" a couple of the web building instructions -- works kind of like code insertion in programming.    I don't know much about bees, though I suspect the mechanisms are similar to spiders. There's a lot of interesting aspects of bees that go back to innate behaviors, such as how queens develop, that's worth further reading.   As for humans, a lot is debatable, but I would argue that two such behaviors are nesting and language. All apes exhibit nesting behavior (ie. Build beds), to the extent that non-human apes in captivity will become distressed when not provided with nesting material. Apes in captivity that have never seen nesting performed by other apes will, if provided with material, nest. Language is a more interesting example as we don't quite know how language evolved. There's heavy evidence that prestructures exist in the brain which influence language development (wernicke's and broca's) but the greatest evidence towards language development as an innate behavior in humans is the Nicaraguan deaf-community where a complex sign language spontaneously emerged amongst youngsters who had otherwise minimal exposure to language.   Edit: Just wanted to add that on the surface language may not seem like what you're getting at, since you're describing somewhat tool use related behaviors, however, there's some theories regarding a relationship between language development and tool use.  Edit 2: Thank you everyone for being as interested in this stuff as me! This has to be my most popular comment and it makes me so happy that it's in science. I had wanted to mention too just the interesting dynamic between the original post's example species. Spiders are the only animal on that list which are not considered a social species and will even cannibalize members of their own species. Interesting food for thought on how much of their behavior is innate considering their lifespan is largely spent without another spider to learn from.

Liquid crystals exist. There are a lot of interesting physics happening in this area. Just look at wikipedia page for States of Matter.  On the other hand, the boundary between gases and liquids/solids has much less going on, basically because the difference between \"attractive forces are overwhelmed by kinetic energy\" (gases) and \"attractive forces hold molecules together\" is much greater than than the difference between \"attractive forces are opposed by other forces\" and \"attractive forces dominate interactions\".",

            " The B1 were easy to manufacture as well as already under production.  During Episode 1, the Trade Federation is the antagonizing power which is why we primarily see the B1 as the primary enemy throughout the film, and the weapons available were designed to augment their capabilities.  The ATT tanks, the massive troop transports, the vulture drones and droidekas are not enough to win battles, thus the Trade Federation brings B1s.   Cheap, easy to replace, modular parts, no questions asked and no messy meatsack overheads.    Advancing to the second film, in which you see the Confederacy of Independent Systems being its formation - the key to this portion is the acknowledgment that each new member brought with them their own droid army, but ultimately the largest member and the one providing much of the initial ships and capital is the Trade Federation again, hence the B1 droids being a ubiquitous troop across all battlefields, even when spider droids, hellfire droids, droidekas *destroyer droids* and Super Battle Droids were available.    Now specifically on the topic of super battle droids - these were a new line representing collaboration between the CIS.  They were being manufactured on Geonosis, again by the trade federation, but the speed of production was not enough to fully replace the standard B1.  I would also imagine that the b1 is preferred in standard infantry operations due primarily to their standardization.    In Star Wars, it is rare in peer conflict to find a defining individual among the rank and file, clone or droid- outliers were bought, built or bred, they didn't spontaneously arise from the ranks.  Thus the CIS would primarily save their SBD and specialized droids for when they are needed.  SBD are more capable against Jedi, and when accompanied with a strong force of B1 and destroyer, they represent a card that CIS command would be hesitant to use unless it was certainly necessary.    As for the emotional responses, Mouse Droids, C3P0, R2D2, many droids are show to have organic replicating outbursts of emotion, the other droids may have felt them too but the b1's had voiced dialogue, and they were self aware of their own mortality and scrawniness that perhaps its just basic droid self-preservation software, but the more powerful droids simply are less afraid due to their stature, or unable to express it due to a lack of organic interfacing translation systems   At the end of the day, the CIS fought a war run by bankers and would be hesitant to invest anywhere they wouldn't see results.  if more B1's would solve the problem, and it usually would, it was preferred.",

In fact, Foucault himself distanced himself from the label of historian:  >His attitude toward the discipline was one of wariness mixed with contempt. **\"I am not a professional historian; nobody is perfect,\" he once remarked**. In the Introduction to the second volume of his *Histoire de la sexualit\u00e9*, published just before his death, **he tells us that his works are studies of history but that he is not a historian**. In short he himself underlined his difference from disciplinary history, and rightly so, for he stands apart from the generally unquestioned conceptual and methodological assumptions that define its boundaries.  This is not to deny any value of his ideas, observations and criticisms, nor to ignore his contributions to the social sciences. But it is important to keep in mind that the history *Foucault* presents is not the same history *historians* present, as Foucault had other goals.  ---  In regard to recommending any text about the history of \"madness\" and how society reacted to what we might today consider mental disorders, I would suggest trying to ask /r/AskHistorians if their rules permit it.  Per your reference to how homosexuality, you could check Rachel Cooper's analysis of the DSM and what are its philosophical underpinnings (e.g. its epistemology of mental illness), which she situates historically, specifically in what context the American Psychiatric Association engaged with the issue of homosexuality, what led to its removal and how the definition of mental disorder was changed to avoid similar occurrencesm by adding the *harm criterion*. She also wrote a book about \"diagnosing the diagnostic manual\". But, these are not history papers either, although Cooper does describe the history of the DSM to explain the ideas behind it.",

In fact, Foucault himself distanced himself from the label of historian:  >His attitude toward the discipline was one of wariness mixed with contempt. **\"I am not a professional historian; nobody is perfect,\" he once remarked**. In the Introduction to the second volume of his *Histoire de la sexualit\u00e9*, published just before his death, **he tells us that his works are studies of history but that he is not a historian**. In short he himself underlined his difference from disciplinary history, and rightly so, for he stands apart from the generally unquestioned conceptual and methodological assumptions that define its boundaries.  This is not to deny any value of his ideas, observations and criticisms, nor to ignore his contributions to the social sciences. But it is important to keep in mind that the history *Foucault* presents is not the same history *historians* present, as Foucault had other goals.  ---  In regard to recommending any text about the history of \"madness\" and how society reacted to what we might today consider mental disorders, I would suggest trying to ask /r/AskHistorians if their rules permit it.  Per your reference to how homosexuality, you could check Rachel Cooper's analysis of the DSM and what are its philosophical underpinnings (e.g. its epistemology of mental illness), which she situates historically, specifically in what context the American Psychiatric Association engaged with the issue of homosexuality, what led to its removal and how the definition of mental disorder was changed to avoid similar occurrencesm by adding the *harm criterion*. She also wrote a book about \"diagnosing the diagnostic manual\". But, these are not history papers either, although Cooper does describe the history of the DSM to explain the ideas behind it.",
        "rejected_target": " Foucault wrote 2 immense books about that, I just know the titles in French but that might help you to find them : Histoire de la sexualit\u00e9 and Histoire de la folie \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge classique."

    "\n\nHuman: How does Cultural Capital work in concrete terms?  From second-hand reading I have a good general idea of what cultural capital is, but I don't always get the its' \"explanative power\".   For example, when you search for literature about what could influence/determine tolerance of non-conformity, cultural capital is more often than not noted as playing a significant role. I can see why one could expect that the years and the kind of schooling you may have had could influence your tolerance of homosexuality for instance. But it is often operationalized in terms of \"participation in cultural activities\" or something alike.  How does being someone that goes to the opera once in a while make you likely to also be someone that is tolerant of homosexuality? And that is, with those two not being mere byproducts of the same other indicators of social standing, but the former actively explaining part of the latter?\n\nAssistant:": {

I don't think cultural capital does do more than indicate social standing/social class in an explanatory sense.

            " With Bourdieu, you really need his concept of \"habitus\" to see the connections. It's not that the going to museums causes you to be tolerant of homosexuality..... remember, Bourdieu's main statistical method is multiple correspondence analysis, it's how things cluster.   Embodying high cultural status (that's the core of habits--embodying things; Bourdieu never really defines it much better in any of his other works) means that you go to museums and are tolerant of homosexuality. Habitus is your tastes, it's your hobbies, it's what brand of beer your drink, it's whether you shake hands or give a high five, it's whether you spit in public, etc. These are *learned*, by imitation generally, and stratified by socio-economic class. But they're not learned at the museum or something like that. The museum is just a quantifiable measurement of your status (maybe not a good one even), it is not the cause of your status.   For more on Bourdieu see my old posts: Bourdieu and Dan Brown; Bourdieu and why beards and fixies won't be mullets and Camaros; Bourdieu and how \"being at ease\" and \"liking everything\" have become high status markers. Of those, the last one might be particularly useful. Check out the linked Shamus Khan chapter if you have a minute, it's like 12 or 16 simple, clear pages, and it gets into how the modern elite habitus is inculcated at an elite boarding school.   I think education or tastes are generally a better proxy than cultural event participation because the events they choose are often very dated and I think in some cases are rare events that people are more likely to answer based on many times they think they should have gone rather than actually went. I just saw an article about participation in Turkey and they were all about events that secular Turks would go to, but not about events that pious Turks would go to. So these measures can just be quite silly, but you shouldn't mistake these measures of cultural capital as causal. Think of them more as degrees on a thermometer than the weather system that causes a heat wave.   For completeness, Bourdieu most famously defined Habitus as:  >s]ystems of durable, transposable dispositions, structured structures predisposed to function as structuring structures, that is, as principles which generate and organize practices and representations that can be objectively adapted to their outcomes without presupposing a conscious aiming at ends or an express mastery of the operations necessary in order to attain them.

    "\n\nHuman: My furrbaby (6 years old female shiba inu) starts shaking and panting without a cause. 2 different vets have no idea whats wrong. Please help! She had stomach x-ray, physical exam and complete blood work done, everything is fine on paper but she keeps suffering. The first vet thinks its acid reflux and the second thinks its a seizure called \"petit mal\", meaning the start of epilepsy. I read all I could find about petit mal (and stomach issues in dogs in general) and watched youtube videos how that seizure looks like, and its nothing like what she goes through.   It all began a week ago, Wednesday early morning. She woke me up asking to go potty and had 2 episodes of diarrhea (melted ice-cream type). She couldn't go up the stairs and was panting heavily, her back legs were shaking as well. She had another 2 episodes of diarrhea the following days (same type) and episodes of panting and shaking which began 1 hour after eating and lasted 2 hours. She is drinking and has an appetite (although a bit declined), but she doesn't want to play like she used to. She goes on walks and goes potty fine (back to solids). There were two incidents when she cried a bit when she was about to go number 2, but didn't show signs of straining.   Her \"episodes\" begins with lip smacking and sounds of swallowing. Then she moves alot, tries to find a different position to lie down, like she is uncomfortable. Sometimes she'll lick whatever is close to her so much that it'll leave a wet mark. Then the heavy panting starts, she'll lay on her stomach or side. After that, her back legs will begin to shake and gradualy become so bad that it's hard for her to walk. She wont go down or up the stairs without help, and won't jump on anything. She also has very scared and sad eyes, something I saw only when she's at the vet. But even during that \"episode\" she's reactive, she'll eat treats (I gave her medication that way) and she'll go out for a walk. She isn't absent, it seems more like she is in pain. She was ok when I didn't give her anything to eat for 12 hours, and even better after 24 hours but the vets told me that what I'm doing is bad since she doesn't vomit, so there's no reason to fast her.   I tried:  1.  Activated charcoal (first thought was that its a poisoning) 2.  Metoclopramide (then I thought maybe nausea) 3.  Omeprazole (first vet said its stomach acid issues). 4.  Metamizole (the only one that seems to kinda help).  All those were by vet recommendation except the last one, which I gave her out of my own account. The Metamizole seems to help, 30 minutes after taking it she seems ok and even jumped by herself on her couch.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Having a panic attack. Seeing a vet tomorrow, but in the meantime, does this look like ringworm on my cat? photos  Species: Feline  Age: 1 year  Sex/Neuter status: Female, spayed  Breed: Tabby  Body weight: 8 lbs.  History: Had a bite on her cheek, but not the most apparent red one in the images  Clinical signs: Scratching, cleaning (not the infected area, just in general)  Duration: 24 hours  Your general location: USA  Links to test results, X-rays, vet reports etc: N/A  For context, I have severe health anxiety. I noticed this red scab/bite on my cat this morning, so I am seeing a vet tomorrow in the afternoon. In the meantime, I am wigging myself out and having a panic attack because I was trying to figure out what might have happened to my cat. Along the way, I saw a photo of feline ringworms, and now I can't get it out of my head that my cat has ringworm and that I am going to catch it. If anybody can please try to at least calm me down or tell me if I'm overthinking this, I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Its day 4 and puppy refuses to eat and has been vomitting multiple times Preface: we live in a very small Muslim Asian country where dogs aren't common and the vet here are Muslims who mostly see and treat cats a majority of their time, they're also not used to handling dogs in general from the experience we've had (I've nothing against the religion, this is just background info). The town I live in is tiny and the vet here is ill equipped; the next city over is a 2 hours car drive where they would have the equipment (i.e. an ultrasound) to try and find the cause of the problem.  Puppy is 5 months old, vaccinated, normally 13.5kg (30lbs) and we rescued him when he was approx 6 weeks old abandoned in a drainage (he's classed as a Southeast Asian village dog by EmbarkVet).  Summary of symptoms:  * Vomits multiple times * Lethargy * Refuses to eat * Weight loss * Very runny stool (occurred only once) * No fever  **Day 1**  I woke my pup up at 7am in his crate to see he's still somewhat asleep. This is weird as normally he'd wake me up and he would usually walk out of the crate within 5 seconds of me opening. We have our morning walk but I cut it short as I see he's not too energetic. I serve him breakfast kibbles and he refused his food. He refused lunch as well. He also refused his treats and would spit it out. I tried chicken breast and he ate it, so I served him a small amount of rice and chicken breast because it concerned me he wasn't taking anything. That was the only meal he had. He was very low energy the whole day and spent his time on the couch chilling. He also did not poop at all this day.  **Day 2**  I woke him up at 7am again to see he has vomited in his crate. He seemed energetic so we had a short walk and he finally pooped (solid stool) and on the way back, he vomited white/yellow foam bile. He vomited again two more times at home. We waited for the nearby vet to open at 9am to bring him. Vet prescribed metoclopramide (for the vomiting?), liver support pills and b-plex. They also gave us Royal Canin Convalesce Support (RCCS) to force feed him. Back home, he ends up vomiting out all the pills we gave and all the food we force fed. He also vomited every time he drank water. Puppy has no energy and we see visible weight loss  **Day 3**  I woke him up at 7am again and he's vomited 2 times in his play pen. We brought him back to the vet and told them about day 2. We asked for an IV drip (administered under the skin) as he was now skin and bones and dehydrated. He's also lost 1.5kg (3lbs). During this time, he had a runny stool outside the vet's office which the vet saw. No blood, just very runny. They prescribed metronidazole (antibiotics) which they helped him take. We also managed to get him to take the metoclopramide and both pills stayed down. We force fed him a small amount of the RCCS 2 hours after the vet visit and he puked it all out 5 minutes after. My SO & I decided to not feed him at all to allow his stomach to recover (after doing some googling) as we notice the vomiting happens after he drinks water or we feed him the RCCS. In the evening, we got him to take the pills but he puked out the antibiotics minutes after he drank a bit of water.  **Day 4**  This is where I'm at now, we just woke him up at 630am and it is now 8am my time. Luckily he hasn't vomited in his pen which is a positive sign but he still refuses food and has no energy. He's looking even thinner than he was yesterday. Our options are either, go to another vet nearby for a second opinion or drive up 2 hours to the city and get him checked there and ask for an ultrasound to see what's going on in his stomach. Or we stick to the prescribed plan and ride it out. We have not given him his pills yet this morning as we fear he may puke it out again. We feel quite defeated that everytime we force feed his pill or food, he is hating us for handling him in such a way and he ends up vomiting soon after.  Any advice?\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: My dog was POISONED?! My dog drank some sort of poison the other day... Not sure if it was antifreeze or what. Anyway, he was taken to the vet, and they said they couldn't do anything to help. He was brought home, and he's had over 20 seizures and lays in his kennel in a puddle of drool. It's pretty much the worst thing I've ever experienced with a pet. It's horrible to watch knowing there isn't a thing I can do to help.  Has anyone experienced this with their dog? Any vets out there? Is there really nothing I can do? Is there any chance he will recover?  He is a 1 year old, Male, Great Pyrenees\n\nAssistant:": {

As the title says, if we are cutting out one end of the body spectrum from modeling for being unhealthy, we should also cut out the other end for the same reason.  We have toned down the use of thin models, because it would be unhealthy for the majority of women to try to attain that body type, yet we praise companies as \"woke\" for using overweight plus sized models, even though being overweight comes with a multitude of health problems.  I would like to clarify that I'm not talking about all plus sized models. Most seem to be within a healthy weight range. However there are some companies I've seen using *over*weight women as models, and I would argue that normalizing this unhealthy body type is just as irresponsible.  Discuss.\n\nAssistant:": {

I believe this is wrong.  For starters, wizards have all sorts of hideouts that are completely inaccessible to muggles(for example, Hogwarts, Diagon Alley). So, *at the very least*, they can avoid being conquered indefinitely.  Which leaves them free to pursue an asymmetrical strategy against the muggles- between invisibility, teleportation and various spells that allow them to spy, they're set. They don't even need to kill anybody, just waiting for opportunities to zap muggle leaders with the Imperius curse would be sufficient.  If they really want to fuck up a target, they need only let loose a quick Fiendfyre spell and apparate away immediately after, leaving the Fiendfyre to lay waste to the area.  This assumes of course that they're not completely incompetent, and aren't crippled early on due to overconfidence before having a chance to learn from their mistakes and pivot to a more cautious/assymetrical strategy.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: CMV: There is nothing wrong with the \"Independent Contractor\" business model on food delivery platforms. For the record, I'm one of these workers and deliver food 4-5 days per week.  As far as I can tell, there are two central issues of hourly pay and benefits. I've included my positions on these two below but if there's another issue I'm missing, mention it and I'll address it.  Hourly Pay:  These apps aren't designed for people to work 8-12 hours per day. In most markets this simply is an unrealistic expectation by the worker. Most of these apps don't even market themselves as a replacement for the 9-5 job, they market themselves as a side hustle to \"help pay the bills\" or \"earn some extra cash\". This, they do perfectly. You can't expect to log onto the app at 9AM and to perform like it's the dinner rush, it isn't a video game where there's an unlimited supply of orders. If you use it as a side hustle (as it is intended) and work during one of the rushes, you can make plenty. My personal experience is that I consistently make $15-20 per hour *after* putting a per-mile amount aside off the top to cover vehicle wear and tear. But yes, if you sit there the whole day expecting orders when nobody is ordering because it isn't lunch/dinnertime, you aren't going to make a very good wage.  The Issue of Benefits:  Most other employers who employ people in lower skill work generally don't provide benefits to their employees, partially as most of those employees work >40 hours per week. So, why should these companies be forced to provide benefits such as health insurance, PTO, etc? For the record though, workman's compensation is a whole different issue.\n\nAssistant:": {

My main point is that sports provide a number of advantages to boys and girls from kindergarten through high school that cannot be replicated by video games. *I am referring to all physical activity, including playing games like tag, manhunt, red rover, etc., as sports to reduce confusion*. I realize that there is a team vs. individual sports distinction that can be made as well as a distinction between activity and sport. Until I get into a deeper conversation I'll refer to both as sports.  I am 24 years old and grew up right in the middle of what I consider to be the proliferation of video game consoles in households. My parents did not let me play very much or very often, instead encouraging my sisters and I to play outside. I became highly involved in sports and I believe they have had a very positive impact on my life. The positive physiological and psychological effects of exercise on the human body are well established.  However, video games are controversial in this manner. There are many positive side effects, but also many negatives. The legitimacy of many studies has been called into question.  I believe that video games create a very isolated, insulated social life for those who play them. Many people seem to develop a certain disdain for their peers and, in my opinion, would benefit greatly from team activity. Sure, there are MMOs that require teamwork, but I do not believe they can mimic the physical sacrifice and the emotion of interaction with others on a field/court/other playing surface.  In my experience, people who categorize themselves as \"gamers\" have fewer friends, especially female friends. They seem disconnected from many aspects of social life and also seem quick to prove that they are smarter than the person with whom they are speaking. I realize that I may not be able to easily connect with these people socially because we do not share a common interest, but even in watching the interaction of those who I know to play video games on a daily basis with others there is noticeable discomfort when they speak with people they do not know.  My conclusions are based largely on my own experiences. I do play video games occasionally, but I quickly tire of them and they are mostly sports games like FIFA or NHL games (although I do play GTA V a fair amount). However, I spend much more time outdoors, playing basketball, football, tennis, golf, etc. I believe that there is far more to be gained by playing a sport, be it individual or team than there is to be gained playing video games. I also believe that it is crucial to get young children outdoors and participating in any physical activity we can. There are numerous studies that show playing sports is very beneficial and these benefits are far greater than any benefit gained through video games. Thanks for reading, I look forward to your responses! _____  > *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

            " I don't think anyone can argue from a physical standpoint which is superior, getting out and running around will always beat sitting down and staring at a display.  However I think your interpretation of the emotional and mental well being is misguided.  > I believe that video games create a very isolated, insulated social life for those who play them. Many people seem to develop a certain disdain for their peers and, in my opinion, would benefit greatly from team activity.  No.  Some of my most memorable moments with my childhood friends included sitting inside on a rainy day playing video games.  Even today when I play, I do it with friends of mine.  We might not be in the same room, or even in the same state but it's anything but an isolated or insulated experience.  Sure, I might not have had to sacrifice my body for an emotional victory, but there were a lot of moments where something epic had been pulled off and we all sat back and had a similar emotional response.  Even on a non-close friend level, I would say that playing online with strangers is still damned good fun and can encourage all the same teamwork and strategy as any sport can.   > In my experience, people who categorize themselves as \"gamers\" have fewer friends, especially female friends.  I'm going to just say that this is your experience and that doesn't speak for the crowd.  In college myself and my two 'gamer' roommates, were social and had girlfriends.  Many people I work with today consider themselves 'gamers' on some level, many are married.  Many of their wives play with them even.  You seem like you're painting the stereotype of the 30 year old guy living in his mother's basement and applying that to everyone that claims to be a 'gamer'.  It's just wrong.  It's no more right than saying that every guy who plays sports is a womanizing jock.  >  even in watching the interaction of those who I know to play video games on a daily basis with others there is noticeable discomfort when they speak with people they do not know  I know a lot of non gamers who are terrible at speaking with strangers.  Some people, regardless of what their hobbies are, just suck at the social aspects of life.  > I believe that there is far more to be gained by playing a sport, be it individual or team than there is to be gained playing video games.  I'll agree on a physical level, because as I opened with it's nearly impossible to argue in favor of video games in this regard.  However on a social, emotional or mental front I think that you just lack the experience with gamers to understand that not all of them are social hermits.  Many of them are just as social as the average non-gamer, and I would be willing to bet that many kids brought up playing sports can be just as anti-social as you believe gamers to be.  Playing sports doesn't magically grant an anti-social kid the ability to socialize.  The benefit in this regard to video games is that the anti-social kid can digest smaller interactions under their own favored circumstances, and without doing it face to face.  That might be more beneficial to someone trying to expand themselves rather than getting thrown right into a highly competitive and tense team sport.",

In the comments you acknowledge that sports carry their own risks, and that everything is good in moderation.  You even seem to support the position that video games have some benefits.  If you phrase it as a binary, \"sports are better than video games\" then you walk down a slippery slope.    Forget arguing that sports are better, surely there a plenty of things that are a better use of most children's time.  You say sports are better than video games, maybe i say tennis is better than football, because it is safer, or even that football is better than tennis, because it is more competitive.  Whatever the argument, asking someone to change their view on which is \"better\" is not the beginnings of a fruitful, view-changing discussion.    When you phrase it like that, of course people who prefer video games get defensive.  You are forcing them either to bring sports down a peg, or raise up video games.  They rightfully point out that the line of causality may go from being a loner to enjoying video games and not the other way around.  Just as being tall pushes some kids to basketball, and being large to football, and being gregarious to drama club, being more introverted can be a push towards video games.  If a high school coach says he should have all of the drama clubs funding because sports are \"better\" than drama club, would you support his proposal?  If the football team decided to defund the chess team because football is \"better,\" who would you support?  The thing is, sports are better than video games for developing the minds of some children, (admittedly, probably most children) but i for one am grateful for the fact that the kids who don't like sports have something engaging to do.  Even if the gamers are in the minority.",

You have to remember that for thousands of years the fastest way to get around was on a horse and you had to be relatively of high station to be able to afford one so for most people it was walking.  So walking 20 miles would be an entire day journey and for many people they would never leave the village they were born in.  With this in mind its quite easy to see that languages could slowly drift apart. With regional dialects evolving out of an original common language until they diverged so completely they could be classed as an entirely new language.  This is the foundation for nearly all European languages.   Only six European languages, Maltese, Basque, Estonian, Hungarian, Finnish and S\u00e1mi, aren't from the same prehistoric root language, Indo-European.   And Basque is the super weird one as we have no idea where it came from and it is completely different to any other language.

People used to stay where they were born and talk to other people who were born in the same place. It's still that way to an extent. New York City has multiple accents. London has multiple accents.  Consider the Galapagos Islands and Darwin's famous finches: different species on different islands.

    "\n\nHuman: \"Neighbor\" left a note at our door stating their findmygoogle pinged a lost phone to our address. Hey all, I have a weird situation.   About two days ago, my roommate answered the door to someone with a letter stating that the application findmyphone has pinged their phone to our address.   The letter said they would be contacting the police if we do not hand the phone over, but the thing is, we are all confused as to how the phone ended up in our house, supposedly.   I say supposedly because this situation does not make sense.   We only live next to two other houses. There's a main road that leads from the exit down past our house. We live off of a side road, and our house is the last house on the back of this road. I hope that makes sense, I don't really know how else to explain it.   So, anyway, we contacted the people who left the note and they said they were going to the gas station that's near our house and it fell off the hood of their car.   But they gave us their address and they live on the other side of town, no where near our house. Our house isn't even in the path to go to said gas station from where they live.  I guess my question is, can police get a warrant sorely based off an app pinging the phone to our location? do they need more proof that the phone is at our house?   We've looked everywhere near and in the house for the phone and we cannot find it.   Location is Missouri.\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: I am an investigative journalist. A well-informed source alerted me of some funny business at the local prosecutor\u2019s office, so I filed a FOIA request. Instead of just denying or approving the request, the prosecutor\u2019s office contacted local LE claiming I had filed an \u201cillegal FOIA request.\u201d The police (who I have learned are apparently bosom-buddies with the prosecuting attorney and his employees) tracked down a close relative of mine, and attempted to interrogate them about my reason for filing the \"illegal\" FOIA. This was obviously an intimidation tactic, but is it something I should consider contacting a civil rights attorney over? Most government officials know not to even ask a journalist why they are making a FOIA request, and this is by far the most extreme response to a FOIA I've ever experienced. Even most corrupt officials will just deny your FOIA request.  This happened a few months ago, and in that timeframe the prosecutor apparently also destroyed the records I was seeking.  A few additional facts that may be pertinent:  * I am a freelance journalist now, but put in four years at a large newspaper. I maintain current credentials with a press association.  * The incident happened in Missouri. Yes, I know FOIAs are called Sunshine Law requests here. Just using \"FOIA\" as a metonym. * Sunshine Law and FOIA requests can be \"invalid,\" but are never \"illegal.\" * This was my first contact with the prosecutor's office, so there was no \"history\" to explain their reaction. * I wasn't just \"fishing.\" The FOIA request was very targeted at records that should have confirmed what my source was saying. * My family was absolutely terrified by the incident. They assumed, based on the demeanor of the investigating police officer, that I had gotten myself into real trouble. They are very afraid of what could happen if re-open my work on the story. * My ability to act as a journalist in the community (at least in regards to LE and the prosecutor's office) has been crippled by this matter.  After doing some research, I found that Missouri has two statutes that may be applicable - one against harassment (RSMo 565.090) and another that prohibits false reports to law enforcement (RSMo 575.080). There is also a Federal statute called Conspiracy Against Rights (18 U.S. Code \u00a7 241) that I think may be applicable (since the prosecutor involved an assistant in contacting LE).  Thoughts/advice much appreciated!\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: Cyclist killed my dog, and sent me to the emergency room almost a month ago. A week ago a coworker sent me pictures and a video of the incident posted by the cyclist. Police don't seem to care at all and are telling me it is a civil issue now. Hi, i am in Ontario Canada and i am looking for some help.  On August 24th around 4 PM i was jogging with my dog on a paved trail. This path is considered mixed use and you see everyone from cyclists to joggers to just people sitting around and watching nature. As i was jogging someone on a bicycle came ripping around a corner at an extremely high speed, and collided with my dog and me. I just remember being hit and then apparently my head slammed against the ground.  Someone else just behind us saw the incident, and apparently the cyclist after colliding with us took off. The lady ended up calling 911 and i was rushed to the emergency room, while this lady apparently rushed my dog to an emergency vet, where he passed away on the way. I ended up getting a bunch of stitches on my head, and suffered from a few cracked ribs.  I explained what happened to the police and they made a report but since they had no way to id the person they couldn't do much.  Last week a coworker who knew about my incident DM'ed me a bunch of pictures of a post in a facebook group, along with the video of the incident. The asshole was complaining about his bike being damaged and how people shouldn't be allowed to walk along this certain path. Not long after it was posted it was removed.  I ended up bringing this information to the police and said they would investigate. Today after not hearing anything i contacted the same officer, who told me the file is closed and it is now a civil issue as it was obviously an accident. I don't understand how this can be true or fair. Can someone enlighten me?\n\nAssistant:": {

Your best bet would be to see if she'll leave voluntarily and if your landlord would resign a new lease. You can do what's called  'cash for keys' and basically pay her off to leave. If all the other roommates want her out you might all chip in a couple hundred bucks and get enough for her to accept it. It would be less expensive than her destroying the apartment, getting you evicted and potentially losing your security deposit.

            " I am not a lawyer - Do you know if you are all on one lease, or if you each have individual leases? If you\u2019re on individual leases, you maybe be able to break your lease early and move out if your landlord doesn\u2019t address your roommates disruptive behavior - tenants in Washington state have a right to quiet enjoyment of their rental units, which puts the burden on landlords to keep the units in safe/habitable conditions, and includes a duty on your landlord to address issues created by other tenants that interfere with your ability to peacefully enjoy your unit. Look up WA State covenant of quiet enjoyment and you should find some helpful info about how to start the process."
        ],
        "sft_target": " If all five of you are on the same lease, then generally your landlord cannot evict just the single tenant. It's an all or nothing proposition. Depending on your lease term and the protections for tenants in your specific area, when the lease is up they *may* be able to just not renew her lease, but this will be location specific. Depending on the terms of the lease, you may also be able to fund a sublet and move out yourself.  If your room mate starts making statements about harming herself or other people, you can call 911. Police and Physicians do have the ability to get her involuntarily admitted to the hospital for a short period of time if she is an immediate danger. Hopefully that will be what she needs to start getting treatment and to turn things around.",

    "\n\nHuman: (Tennessee, US) My high school is officially organizing a religious award. What is the case law surrounding religious sponsorship in K\u201312 schools? My high school is organizing a religious award, entitled Doer of the Word, in which high school seniors may vote for the student they consider to be the most \u201cChrist-like.\u201d Everything I've heard about Supreme Court case law suggests to me that a religion may not be officially sponsored by the administration of a school, but I haven't seen anything governing this specific circumstance. Is there any case law relating to these sorts of awards?\n\nAssistant:": {
