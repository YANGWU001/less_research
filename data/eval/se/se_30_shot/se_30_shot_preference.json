I invited some of my non-academic network who are wonderful collaborators. </p>\n\n<p>After the symposium we discussed further work together. He asked if I would assist with chairing a (broad discipline) conference, and I was excited about us working together, thinking how great it was to have a good relationship with someone who was more focused on our subdiscipline than my supervisors are, and looking forward to post-PhD collaborations. I felt he was 'taking me under his wing' and that my expertise would be highly useful to him.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, the role we had discussed for conference organisation went to someone else, without him informing me. </p>\n\n<p>And I've found out he has been putting together a project proposal with my wonderful collaborators, without mentioning it to me. Naively, it never even occurred to me that someone would do this. It seems particularly weird because geographically I'm located right next to these collaborators, and there are plenty of similar organisations in his area that he could have reached out to.</p>\n\n<p>Right now I'm feeling pretty raw about this.

Being a naive undergraduate, I knocked on proffessor's doors, asking for a supervisor, and one of them, very generously agreed. He suggested a problem I thought was interesting and so I started the research. I originally started throwing analysis at the problem, and started trying to solve some really complex differential equations (which kept me motivated). However I did not make much progress, so after my supervisor marked that I needed to get something, I fully changed my approach and started using some geometric approximations to solve the issue. This generated some results, but was too simple. I'd like to say that my results were inversely proportional to how much effort I was putting in the research.</p>\n\n<p>Time passed, I had multiple potential solutions and a way to evaluate them. On the last week before the final submission I realised there was a bug in my code base that was destroying the results (they were mathematically impossible). I tried to find the error, but the best I could do was identify an area where a mistake could have happened. </p>\n\n<p>Finally I got my evaluation on the course after presenting it. The feedback said the methods were a bit naive and could be improved on, and it was dissapointing that I didn't get numerical results (I had visual results, not numerical), however since I was not a seasoned researcher they decided to be lenient and gave me an A anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I applied to the grad program at my university, and asked the same proffessor to be my supervisor for the grad program. I am in desperate need of financial support until the grad program starts, and so my supervisor said I could do summer research for him and in the meanwhile we could discuss what the grad project could be. What he wants me to do is finish my previous work and get a publication. </p>\n\n<p>The issue is that I legitimately feel that dinking bleach would be more motivating (I am using this metaphor to convey just how much anxiety this is giving me). This research really does not appeal to me in any way or form, and the interesting part is over, all that is missing is finding the bug, which could take more than two weeks to solve and implementing a couple of modifications to make my naive methods less naive if things go well, or complete failure to finish it in the worst case.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to that I have been doing independent research simultaneously as I have been taking courses and doing everything else. Although this independent research still needs a lot of work, it's in a good place, I have already improved many of the papers I have read and have multiple ideas to explore. In an ideal world I would win the lottery tomorrow and I could just support myself while I carry on with this research.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure how to approach my supervisor and tell him I don't want to finish this research, nor how to suggest to do my research instead and get a publication out of that, or even if I should touch on this topic at all.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

I would like to know what would be the best option to deal with it. </p>\n\n<p><strong>option 1</strong>: ignore it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>option 2</strong>: correct it when I receive reviewers' feedbacks WITHOUT letting the reviewers and editor know.</p>\n\n<p><strong>option 3</strong>: correct it when I receive reviewers' feedbacks AND let the reviewers and editor know.</p>\n\n<p>I'm worried that letting the editor and reviewers know would leave a bad impression on me and the quality of my work. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance!</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

Almost all of you agree that the second issue is harmless, but there are different opinions regarding the first one.</p>\n\n<p>So I said that my supervisor knows better, and I decided to go on and started planning the outline of the paper with his help.

Sure, if the quality/stature of the venue where this is published is not too high, few would take this paper seriously, but even then, it would be better than no publications at all (seeing that you are just completing a Bachelor's degree - my advice would have been completely different had you been a grad student, where the expectations are a lot higher).</p>\n",

If the paper gets accepted at a good venue, then this is even better.</p>\n\n<p>At the current stage of your career, your main concern should be getting into a good graduate program.

            " <p>Minimum conditions for ensuring this - or any other - paper doesn't hurt your career:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The research findings must be sound.</strong> don't get tempted into writing, or being listed as a co-author for, papers presenting research when you're \"not convinced about the quality\" of the research findings; or 'fluffy' papers which don't really present much at all; or mere rehashes of other results etc.</li>\n<li><strong>The paper must be relatively well-written</strong> - both in terms of language and in terms of structure and narrative flow. Now, I say 'relatively' because this is often hard to get right with the pressure of time and page limits; and with English not being the native language of most researches. So, readers will be somewhat tolerant about this point - but if you write something that is just very hard to follow, or in very poor English, that doesn't reflect well on you.</li>\n<li><p><strong>Unfortunately, attention must be paid to the venue of publication.</strong> I must first qualify that... obviously some publications are more highly-regarded w.r.t. their filtering process and the typical quality of articles they carry, and some less so. The thing is, I believe one should not assume that if a paper is published in a 'weaker' journal, that necessarily means it's bad - and if someone is evaluating your qualifications as an academic they should bother to skim the paper itself and make up their own mind. That doesn't always/often happen, so people may well judge your work by looking at where you've published. Of course, this is not something binary (\"good\" journals and \"bad\" journals, or conferences) -  but having mostly obscure venues in your list of publications does reflect poorly on you, and in some fields I guess there are venues you should actively avoid even at the price of no publication.</p>\n\n<p>Having said all that - for your first publication, as long as it's not a disreputable venue, it doesn't matter much. Most people \"start out small\".</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The last point, about venues, is also a sort of a safety guarantee for you: If you submit a paper to a conference or journal with a good peer-review process, and you're accepted, then it's highly likely that your paper is actually pretty good, and even more likely that it will reflect favorably on you (the converse is not necessarily true of course; lots of good papers get rejected).</p>\n"

In fact, even the concept of last name is different from culture to culture and may even be absent -- see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category%3aNames_by_culture\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Names_by_culture</a>. Even in Europe, you can get <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_naming_customs\" rel=\"nofollow\">quite complicated naming systems</a>. So you are really trying to identify the \"main professional name\", whatever that may map to in a given culture. To identify it from the list of names <em>as written within that culture</em>, you have be familiar with the specific naming conventions (maybe the Wikipedia page helps, or if you know someone from that culture, you can ask them).</p>\n\n<p>It's worth keeping in mind that getting it right serves two purposes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Making sure everybody knows the person you refer to, even if they don't know the full name.</p></li>\n<li><p>Showing courtesy towards that person.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>While the second point is the only one of importance when addressing the person directly (\"Dear Professor/Dr. X\"), in your case the first point is actually more important: If (say) a referee wants to check the bibliography whether you cited a relevant author's works, they would expect to find them in a certain form. If everybody uses the same (wrong) way of parsing the name, it would arguably be the right thing to do to follow that choice.</p>\n\n<p>(Finally, you could also chicken out and just list <em>all</em> authors in full, native name order; in Bibtex, you can do this by wrapping the full name in curly braces.)</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I know this is a topic that some people have strong opinions about, but a toxic culture is developing in my department whereby several postdocs have convinced themselves that they are being mistreated because of extremely small -- often imaginary -- confrontations.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a postdoc encountered a senior staff member in a doorway. The staff member apparently gave her a \"funny look\", which confirmed the postdoc's view that this staff member is abusing their position of privilege. Anyone who points out that this is a total non sequitur is accused of allowing bullying to flourish. </p>\n\n<p>This situation has been building steadily over the last few years and now five or six postdocs keep a running tally of \"microaggressions\" so microscopic that it is very difficult to see how they can exist. For example, one postdoc sits with their back to a door, and a professor came in to talk to another colleague, and didn't acknowledge them. This incident was talked about for weeks as evidence of the professor's \"rudeness\". In other cases, some people are labelled \"creeps\".</p>\n\n<p>To be clear: I absolutely do not condone abuse. I know power dynamics are real, and that many minorities (of which I belong to several) experience daily microaggressions and othering. I have been on the receiving end of workplace bullying myself, and would never wish to silence real problems. I too am a postdoc, so have no additional power and gain nothing from allowing abuse to flourish.</p>\n\n<p>What worries me is that none of these incidents are being raised with any of the staff members in question. Therefore, many junior researchers have accepted as fact that their professors are horrible and selfish people. I'm concerned about this mindset, because in at least three cases, these \"selfish\" professors have some form of autism (I know this as I'm a wellness officer). Perfectly ordinary behaviour is framed as malicious.</p>\n\n<p>Personally I've found it very upsetting. Many of the people on the receiving end of this gossip are very kind, if not socially awkward, people. It scares me that so many people uncritically accept that everyone with a permanent job is some kind of bogeyman; of course, I cannot betray confidentiality by informing my colleagues that many of these incidents didn't occur and indeed it's kind of ableist to assume you can read minds all the time. Abuse and power struggles certainly can, and often do, occur... but if any of these complaints were substantial they should be raised with HR. </p>\n\n<p>The sad truth is that I think my colleagues just get their power from trash talking others, and aren't actually interested in the truth. Dissenting voices get shunned (and accused of being privileged / not being woke). Anyone who isn't in 100% agreement gets immediately shut down. But, also, my colleagues are just upsetting themselves for no reason. They're scared of encountering these \"terrifying\" professors, most of who have done nothing worse than dressing slightly shabbily and being uncomfortable with eye contact. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone have any advice on dealing with this kind of situation?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>For dealing with this kind of issue, I recommend looking at the rules for bullying and harassment <em>from both ends</em>.  It is settled law that rules on workplace bullying protect both junior employees from senior employees, but also protect senior employees from junior employees.  Moreover, to sustain a complaint of workplace bullying and harassment, this requires some ongoing or serious acts; it is not established by trivial isolated incidents of the kind you are describing (i.e., so-called \"microaggressions\").</p>\n\n<p>If your description is correct then a formal complaint of harassment for these \"micro-agressions\" would almost certainly not meet the requirements to be sustained.  In view of that, the people making the complaints must be careful that their own characterisations of senior staff, and their own rumour-mongering, does not <em>itself</em> amount to bullying and harassment.  In particular, referring to other staff members as \"creeps\", if done repeatedly and without any legitimate basis, could certainly amount to bullying.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of advice, that is where it gets tricky.  If someone is subject to name-calling and rumour-spreading they have the option to document this and put in their own complaint of bullying, even if they are a senior person and the bullying is coming from a junior colleague.  Ultimately you will need to think about what level of confrontation with this issue is desirable, and whether the staff in your department would be more amenable to an informal discussion to reduce tensions, or a formal complaint process where bad behaviour is dealt with through formal channels.</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I did a campus interview two weeks ago (US universities, R1, Engineering). I was not the last candidate, so, by considering the last one, the search was closed one week ago. In the last meeting with the department chair, he said the department will select the final candidate next week and it seems they have made some decisions based on the information I have. I received an update this weekend from the department chair indicating that they are working with the dean's office and I should get an update this week. First, I interpreted this email positively in a way that probably I will be their first choice since they should keep all finalists on hold until the first candidate (assuming to be me!) signs the offer, which normally takes time (negotiation, salary, lab space, ...). So, there is no reason to notify me if I am not the first candidate.</p>\n<p>Then, I looked at this matter differently and thought maybe they already have offered another candidate and they are indeed waiting to get some approval from the dean for that person (probably the candidate has some requests). Because sometimes dean's office can approve the final candidate after a few days since it should not be a long process. I am not sure which case is more likely. I know that I should be more patient, but it is honestly difficult!</p>\n<p>So, my question is about your experience with the hiring process and its timeline.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: <p>One of my colleagues at my institution, Prof. A, is the editor of a journal, Journal X, (and I am not involved in the journal in any way). I received an email by a professor, Prof. B, who had submitted two articles to Journal X and accuses Prof. A. of intentionally delaying the publication of these articles by not handling them properly. Prof. B claims that Prof. A did not answer his queries per email and that another editor of Journal X also did not answer his emails. The email I got from Prof. B was openly targeted to several other colleagues at my institution and also to a number of other people I do not know and also to Prof A. At the end of his email, Prof. B asks me (and the others - more or less verbatim) \"Is this attitude of Prof. A normal or are there any unethical elements [...]?\" and to \"join in this story\". </p>\n\n<p>I found it disturbing that Prof. B wrote such an email to such an audience and I would say that his way of addressing the situation was not ok. However, I wonder what my reaction should be. Normally, I would just stop by at Prof. A's office, but I am on sabbatical leave so this is not an option. I do not know more details about the issue of the publication, but I think that these do not really matter in this case, as I only want to ask about what I should do:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Should I answer Prof. B that this way of addressing the issue was not ok?</li>\n<li>Should I inform Prof. A that I found this email inappropriate?</li>\n<li>Should I just act as if I haven't read this email?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I would especially appreciate answers from people with experience on an editorial board, but other guiding comments are also helpful.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

But I think it is perfectly okay not to respond. First of all, you are one of a long list of recipients, so it would be quite unreasonable for Prof. B to expect each and every recipient of the email to set aside their work and life to dedicate themselves to studying in detail the situation he is describing and then write an equally detailed reply. Basically, to put it bluntly, Prof. B's email can be reasonably classified as spam and there is certainly no obligation to reply to it in any way.</p>\n\n<p>Second of all, you are on sabbatical, which is a sacred time you should devote to nurturing your own interests and passions and ignoring the daily trivia and tedium of academic life. The case for not responding is therefore even stronger (to the extent it needed any strengthening). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Should I inform Prof. A that I found this email inappropriate?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, you have been implicated in this business completely through the actions of others and have no duty to take any action.

But there is absolutely no need to do so.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Should I just do as if I haven't read this email?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wouldn't falsely pretend that I haven't read the email, if that's what you mean - that would be dishonest and unprofessional (and besides, you have now documented publicly your knowledge of the email ;-)). Nor would I plan on saying (as Wolfgang Bangerth suggests in his answer) that I deleted it since it was \"none of my business\" (I don't think that unethical behavior by others is none of my business - it would be perfectly appropriate to consider it my business if I were so inclined).

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Yes, I know Apple says this will no longer work. But it continues to work just fine on iOS 9 devices. Both iPad and iPhone iOS 9 devices continue to sync via my IMAP account. I enter or modify a note on iPad and I see the change on iPhone immediately, and vice versa. And my web mail client see the Notes folder with the updates. All sub-folders are visible in iPhone and iPad and in the web mail client...but not on Mac OS X.</p>\n\n<p>How can I fix my Mac Notes configuration to reenable syncing via IMAP? I don't need the new features of Notes on El Capitan... I need basic synchronization of simple notes between all devices. I can't use iCloud or any other for-profit web service, I need to sync through a specific IMAP server for compliance reasons.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried restoring the old Notes app, but Apple disallows this during the Time Machine restore function.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>When using notes.app in El Capitan, I've noticed that the account settings are lost in the Notes config file. It's a sqlite3 file, I've described what to do in my blog: <a href=\"http://rene.margar.fr/2015/10/refaire-fonctionner-notes-avec-imap-sous-osx-el-capitan/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Refaire fonctionner Notes avec IMAP sous OSX El Capitan</a>. It's in french you may use google translate if you can't read french.</p>\n\n<p>It says that you need to open with sqlite3 file ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/NotesV6.storedata\nand execute some SQL statements with your imap settings (account, server, prefix)</p>\n",
            " <p>For anyone else stumbling over this because Notes.app stopped syncing IMAP based notes in El Capitan 10.11.3, the solution which worked for me is the following:</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, check that the <strong>IMAP Path Prefix</strong> is correct for the account. This can be done in <em>System Preferences / Internet Accounts / (select your account) / Advanced</em> or in <em>Mail.app / Preferences / Accounts / (select your IMAP account) / Advanced</em>. In my case, this was set correctly to <code>INBOX</code>, but sometimes requires different values, or no value at all.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the <a href=\"http://rene.margar.fr/2015/10/refaire-fonctionner-notes-avec-imap-sous-osx-el-capitan/\" rel=\"nofollow\">solution</a> given above by @rene actually works, but it's in French, so here's a step-by-step approach that worked for me.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open Terminal.app to get a command prompt</li>\n<li>Change directory to the following folder:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><code>bash&gt; cd ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/</code></p>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Make a backup the file NotesV6.storedata so that you can restore it in case something goes wrong</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><code>bash&gt; cp NotesV6.storedata NotesV6.storedata.old</code></p>\n\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Open <code>NotesV6.storedata</code> with sqlite3</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><code>bash&gt; sqlite3 NotesV6.storedata</code></p>\n\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>A new sqlite prompt will appear - you can always exit by pressing <code>CTRL-D</code></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><code>sqlite&gt;</code></p>\n\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>(Optional) You can examine the table that we need to fix by entering the followoing command</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><code>sqlite&gt; .schema ZACCOUNT</code></p>\n\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><p>The <code>ZACCOUNT</code> table contains all accounts which Notes.app is accessing. However, in my case, the IMAP based account entry was missing information about username (field <code>ZUSERNAME</code>), hostname (field <code>ZHOSTNAME</code>) and path prefix (field <code>ZSERVERPATHPREFIX</code>).

            " <p>There's a great application called <a href=\"http://www.jaksta.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jaksta</a> that I use that makes it really easy to download all kinds of media from the web. All you have to do is open Jaksta, then go to Safari and play any video or music you want. Jaksta then downloads the file and converts it automatically. Here's a review of Jaksta from <a href=\"http://www.macnews.com/2011/02/03/jaksta-easily-grabs-online-videos-music-mac\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MacNews</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jaksta supports just about all streaming formats and protocols (including FLV, HTTP, RTMP, IceCast, WMV, ASF, MP3, MP4, SWF, etc.), which means it can capture video from thousands of web sites including YouTube and Facebook. What's more, because of Jaksta\u2019s powerful audio-capturing capabilities, customers can download streaming audio from their favorite music and radio sites.</p>\n<p>In addition to allowing Mac users to save their favorite videos, songs, and radio programs, Jaksta can automatically convert the downloaded files to a variety of devices. For example, you can save files as QuickTime for the iPod, iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV, as well as import 'em into iTunes. A drop-down menu lets you choose the conversion method you want.</p>\n<p>Jaksta can automatically convert captured media files to other formats. The default setting is Default Conversion. This is best if you\u2019d like everything that you download to be easily playable on your Mac. For example, it converts downloaded FLV\u2019s to .mov files that play perfectly in QuickTime.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's a description from the Jaksta website:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jaksta for Mac is easy to use: just open Jaksta, then play the video, music or audio you\u2019d like to capture. You will find that your media is recorded up to ten times faster than playback speed, since Jaksta is grabbing files directly from the web site where they are hosted. This downloading technique means that the quality of the recorded files are perfect copies of the original.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Anyway, I highly recommend Jaksta (and I'm not affiliated with them in any way).</p>\n",

            " <p>The problem lies in the fact the \u201cMic\u201d input in all the Macintosh line (Macbooks, iMacs, Mac Pro) is not a Mic input but a Line Input as it has been already stated.</p>\n\n<p>A Line input expects a much higher signal than a typical microphone, so the signal is barely if at al heard if you plug a mic directly into that.</p>\n\n<p>Then we have the impedance issue, the different impedance can be explained like\u2026 imagine a small water globe (the mic) hitting a brick wall (the line in). That\u2019s what the sound coming from the Mic experiences when it \u201chits\u201d the line in. It bounces back and nothing gets through. </p>\n\n<p>As for your question, I am not aware of those, but you can get very cheap USB dongles that will let you connect both the headphones and the mic into a single USB. There are plenty, Creative Labs having one as far as I can remember. They are usually deprecated because most headphones for computing ARE USB directly, meaning they have the circuitry integrated.</p>\n",
            " <p>Of course the combined jack on Macbook is analog, of course it accepts mic signals (works with apple and other brand headsets for iPhone, for example) and not just line in signals (you can even plug electric guitar with passive adaptor from iRig) and as Zneak properly points in his question, it would not be too difficult to make an adaptor that splits one headset jack on Macbooks into headphone and mic, which is also great if you want to use some top notch headset like Sennheiser PC 360. Unfortunately I was not able to find such a product, only <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/133quot-Macbook-Pro-HeadphoneMic-Adapter/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a guide on how to make one</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Last but not least, USB headsets are in no way better. They only use extra CPU power, clutter USB ports and are only as good as the DACs, ADCs, headphone and mic they employ. Now these components are much better inside Macbook and good analogue headset...</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B002SK66OY\" rel=\"nofollow\">Headset Buddy</a> at Amazon claims to do just this. But I am not sure how well it will work, as the headset pinout Apple uses in Macbook, iPhone or iPad is different from some other manufacturers (that is why you cannot use iPhone headset with, say Samsung Galaxy S)</p>\n",

Using it you can use your normal microphone (and optionally headphones) by plugging them into the combined \"headphone\" port on the MBP (not the \"audio in\" port).</p>\n\n<p>Note that on my MBP (Mid 2010) this functionality does not work under Windows XP or Windows 7.  If you need a headset microphone under Windows, I would recommend a USB-Mic adapter instead, such as the Griffin iMic.</p>\n"

If this was helpful, please consider an up-vote. Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>PS: At the time of writing this, the package in the store was on version 0.94-1.

It allows you to browse files and directories with <strong>Nautilus</strong> and then open them as root (Administrator).</p>\n<p>Installation is straight forward:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt install nautilus-admin\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now when you are in Nautilus you'll have an extra option to Edit as administrator:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HAqmQ.gif\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HAqmQ.gif\" alt=\"nautilus admin.gif\" /></a></p>\n<hr />\n<h2><code>gedit</code> as root doesn't allow preferences</h2>\n<p>When you run <code>gedit</code> as root you can't use the preferences you've set up as a regular user for tab stops, convert tabs to spaces, font name, font size, line wrap, etc.</p>\n<p>To solve this I've written the script <code>sgedit</code> to inherit user preferences and apply them to root: <a href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/92655/how-can-i-sync-my-root-gedit-with-my-user-gedits-preferences/1047405#1047405\">How can I sync my root gedit with my user gedit&#39;s preferences?</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call using <code>sgedit filename1 filename2 ...</code></li>\n<li>Gets user's gedit settings for tab stops, fonts, line-wrap, etc.</li>\n<li>Elevates to <code>sudo -H</code> to preserve file ownership whilst getting root powers.</li>\n<li>Requests password if last <code>sudo</code> has timed out.</li>\n<li>Gets sudo's gedit settings</li>\n<li>Compares differences between user and sudo gedit settings</li>\n<li>Runs gsettings set on the differences only (reduces 174 set commands to a dozen or less. Next time it's run perhaps only one or two changes but often times no changes.</li>\n<li>Calls <code>gedit</code> as a background task such that terminal prompt reappears immediately.</li>\n</ul>\n"

As it is no longer maintained, it's recommended to use its replacement <code>avconv</code> instead, provided in the <code>libav-tools</code> package (which seems to be automatically installed if <code>ffmpeg</code> was installed).</p>\n<p>The command needed to use <code>avconv</code> for conversions is not too much different than from <code>ffmpeg</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>avconv -i input.ogv output.webm\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thus, if anybody's facing the same issue of trying to use only free packages to convert from .ogv to .webm in 12.04 (or presumably later), this is how I resolved it. This should be helpful if you're making recordings to show new features or document issues using video.</p>\n",
            " <p>I'm using things like that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>avconv -f x11grab -s 1024x768 -r 24 -i 0:0 -deadline realtime -b 5000000 -minrate 200000 -maxrate 40000000 recording-filename-000.webm\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em><strong>Where:</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p><code>-f x11grab</code> - enforces screen capture \"format\" of input. </p>\n\n<p><code>-s 1024x768</code> is the resolution of input file (aka capture area). For example equals to desktop resolution. If smaller than that, recording area would be at left and top. I used 1024x768 recording area in this example. </p>\n\n<p><code>-r 24</code> - framerate. Basically, 23 to 30 FPS used by real movies to give a smooth recording picture. However for screencast it could be okay to reduce this to get better picture at lower bitrates. I used 24 to do game screen capture.</p>\n\n<p><code>-i 0:0</code> is a hint to use display 0:0 as source (device is in xorg notation). If you have only 1 monitor and default Xorg setup, 0:0 will be ok most of times.</p>\n\n<p><code>-deadline realtime</code> - is a hint to libvpx. We want live capture. We want realtime performance. So libvpx will do it best to encode VP8 in REALTIME. To do so it somewhat trades quality for speed. At given bitrate quality will be a bit worse than it would be in non-realtime way. But encoding speed would skyrocket. So on my hardware it can crunch 1024x768@24FPS, intense scenes, without dropping any frames (powerful CPU recommended though). In this example I wanted a decent-quality live capture at good FPS and quite large capture area. So CPU usage by codec could be an issue. That's why this hint really needed for good results.</p>\n\n<p><code>-b 5000000</code> - target bitrate in bits/second. I used 5Mbits to get more-or-less good picture of quite intense scenes. Codec will try to keep average bitrate speed of video close to this value. The lower this value, the worse the quality and smaller the file. You can experiment a bit to get idea what bitrate is good for particular uses. Video sharing services would downconvert video if you overshoot. If you about to use own server, it's up to you to take care of traffic. If you undershoot, picture quality will be bad. Feel free to change value to get idea what's best for you. 5Mbits were intended for more or less eye-pleasant live capture of intense scenes at games where you can't easily see that picture is overcompressed. For capturing still applications you will basically need far less than that. </p>\n\n<p><code>-minrate</code> 200000 - is a minimum allowed bitrate for codec. Depending on a nature of thing you want to capture, sometimes you may want to force minimum bitrate to keep a reasonably looking pictire at no matter what. Sometimes codec heuristic could reduce bitrate far below values you may want, giving bad picture at some scenes. This option allows to force codec to keep minimum bitrate even if codec thinks that scene is simple and bitrate could be dropped. High value of this parameter may increase file size by preventing codec from using lower bitrates. </p>\n\n<p><code>-maxrate 40000000</code> - This value controls maximum burst bitrate at intense scenes. I used really high value to allow codec to go far higher than desired average if it considers higher speed is mandatory to keep decent quality at some scene. To get a good-looking picture in all conditions it's desirable to set this high enough (40Mbits is BlueRay-like speed and will do the trick). On other hand, if you're about to stream it using your own server, you have to reduce this value at cost of some picture quality at intense scenes. Else server could fail to cope with desired burst bitrate, being unable to deliver it in realtime way to users. Then player would face buffer underrun (which is annoying). Video-sharing services will take care on their own and usually downconvert video to lower parameters at the cost of picture quality.</p>\n\n<p><code>recording-filename-000.webm</code> - is a file name of output. If you use .webm extension, ffmpeg/avconv are smart enough to understand you want WEBM. It is THAT simple - avconv guesses desired format from filename. So .WEBM files are WEBM inside. </p>\n\n<p>That is it - this command does direct screen recording to webm file. No extra conversions needed and <code>libvpx</code> is hinted to be as fast as it can. There is no sound since there is no specification for sound input. It may or may not be what you want. For sound, you have to specify input source for sound stream as well.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. this may look a little overcomplicated but at the end of day you can figure out that one size can't fit all. So to get a good-looking picture in all situations you may really want to have some handles for codec used and want to adjust them. Ffmpeg gives you all the handles you may ever need and far more than that. It's a heavy weaponry of video conversion and encoding. So this example is a good point to start for those who want to do more or less advanced encodings and is ready to experiment a bit to get a really decent-looking results.</p>\n",

For all purposes but serious 3D gaming, open source drivers provide decent performance. It runs Unity just fine (which is a 3D desktop), and it also handles 720p and 1080p videos quite well.</p>\n\n<p>Open source drivers are usually more stable, developed by people that understand Linux much better than ATI or NVidia, and definitely more secure, since they are open and thus can be audited, while proprietary ones are a black box. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, proprietary have AMD's Catalyst Center, a nice GUI where you can fine-tune and have control about some features.</p>\n\n<p>But these minor differences apart, in the end of day performance is still the major difference when it comes to proprietary vs open source video drivers.</p>\n"

        "responses": [
            " <p>I think you're a bit confused about what configuration files do, and what programes (commonly referred to as binaries) actually do.</p>\n\n<p>Binaries or programs are programs that do something. They actually are executed, and the statements evaluated. That may be as simple as 2+2, or more complex, such as <code>ls</code>, which lists contents of current directory.</p>\n\n<p>Configuration files modify <em>what</em> programs do. For instance <code>ls</code> may be configured to show colors, columns, and so on. The program <code>ls</code> supports all these things, but they can be activated or deactivated depending on configuration.</p>\n\n<p>For more complex programs, such as <code>apache</code>, which is a webserver, the configuration files may change behaviour of the program to an extreme degree. </p>\n\n<p>Programs are not configuration files, and configuration files are not programs. A configuruation file does not perform any task, it instructs some program on how to behave.</p>\n",
            " <p>It depends on the application and the author of the software. If the author intended the application to have various configuration parameters for user, they can either let the user supply command-line arguments that change application behavior, or there can be config files to keep that information for future use. Many applications such as services and daemons need configuration files at boot because  the config files will provide all the necessary information for service to perform its task. Controlling hardware, such as assigning stating IP to network card, is much easier and shorter with config file rather than doing that each and every time by yourself.</p>\n\n<p>As for <code>ls</code>, it's just due to history. Original <code>ls</code> did one and only thing - list files in the directory and creators didn't intend it to have config files, although it does have command-line arguments. POSIX standards makes <code>ls</code> as one of among basic commands required to be supported by Unix-like operating systems, and Ubuntu does provide <code>ls</code> to adhere to the standard. However, if someone wanted to make <code>ls</code> which implements POSIX features and also uses config files - they could very well do that.</p>\n",
            " <p>I think you are not only confused about <em>config</em> files and <em>binary</em> files but also about <em>config</em> files and <em>scripts</em>. Let me show a very simple example and start with a <em>config file</em>:</p>\n\n<h3>Config file <code>hello.conf</code></h3>\n\n<pre><code>WHAT=World\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This simple text file just sets a configuration variable. It sets the variable <code>WHAT</code> to the value <code>World</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Now consider a simple <em>script file</em> that uses the value defined in the <em>config file</em> <code>hello.conf</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>Script file <code>hello.sh</code></h3>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-bash prettyprint-override\"><code>#!/bin/bash\n\nsource hello.conf\necho \"Hello, $WHAT\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The first line tells the OS how to handle this file. In this case it will be run by the <code>/bin/bash</code> program. <code>bash</code> knows the syntax we use in this script and acts accordingly. That is: it <em>sources</em> (=reads) our <em>config file</em> <code>hello.conf</code> and then is able to use all the definitions we made in that file. Next, it echoes the string <code>Hello,</code> followed by the content of the variable <code>$WHAT</code> from the config file. If we run that script, we get:</p>\n\n<pre><code>user@host # ./hello.sh\nHello, World\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we could change the <em>config file</em> to contain, for example, <code>WHAT=Jim</code> instead. We can now run the very same <em>script file</em> without any change but it will now print</p>\n\n<pre><code>user@host # ./hello.sh\nHello, Jim\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So <em>config files</em> are a way to change the behaviour of programs without touching the programs themselves. This separation of data and code is an important step in programming as it helps keeping the code clean and independent of the data.</p>\n\n<p>Now for something more complicated: A <em>binary file</em>. I've written a simple program in a programming language called <code>C</code>. The special thing about it is that we first write <em>source code</em> in a text file and then <em>translate</em> (we say <em>compile</em>) that text file into a machine readable (binary) form. This binary form is no longer human-readable (well, at least not easily), but the machine can read it perfectly.</p>\n\n<h3><code>C</code> source file <code>hello.c</code></h3>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-c prettyprint-override\"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    FILE *file = fopen( \"hello.conf\", \"r\" );\n    if (file) {\n        char line[1024];\n        char what[256];\n        while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), file)) {\n            if (sscanf(line, \"WHAT=%s\", what) == 1) {\n                printf( \"Hello, %s\\n\", what );\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        fclose(file);    \n    }    \n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can already see, this is far more and more complicated code than we used for the <code>hello.sh</code> and I already omitted error handling to simplify it. However, this code is of no use to the OS. We first need to <em>compile</em> (translate) it into a machine readable form. That's what compilers are for and I'll use <code>gcc</code> (a standard <code>C</code> compiler) here. So:</p>\n\n<pre><code>user@host # gcc hello.c -o hello\nuser@host # ls -l\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 8536 Jan  6 12:43 hello\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  423 Jan  6 12:16 hello.c\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user   11 Jan  6 12:18 hello.conf\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 user user   60 Jan  6 12:26 hello.sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The compiler produced the <em>binary</em> file <code>hello</code> (without any extension) and we can now execute that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>user@host # ./hello\nHello, Jim\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we can again change the definition in the <code>hello.conf</code> to change the behaviour of our <em>binary</em> program <code>hello</code> without changing the source code and re-compiling it. I could now send that binary <code>hello</code> without the <code>C</code> source code (<code>hello.c</code>) to someone else and he can execute that binary together with a proper config file <code>hello.conf</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Binary files (like a compiled C program) and script files (like bash scripts) have various differences, some of which are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Binaries are (almost) immutable, i.e. a \nuser cannot change the code they execute (only \nthe data they operate on). They behave as they \nwere written and compiled.</li>\n<li>Binaries usually run faster \nthan scripts because the syntax check and has \nalready been done at compile time (just once). \nThe compiler will also optimize the code while \ntranslating to run even faster.</li>\n<li>Scripts on the other hand are \nevaluated (checked) each time the script \nis run. This can take time.</li>\n<li>Scripts are human-readable, i.e. a user can look into\na script and tell what it does.\nThis is not easily possible for binaries as you already\nnoticed. Without a really deep, deep knowledge of the machine\nreadable code you cannot tell what the binary actually\ndoes. You have to believe what the documentation says or\nwhat the programmer told you.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The last item is where <em>Open Source</em> kicks in: the idea is that binaries are shipped together with the source code so a user can see the source code and compile the programs himself. <em>Closed Source</em> software on the other hand just ships with the binaries.</p>\n"

        "rejected_target": " <p>It depends on the application and the author of the software. If the author intended the application to have various configuration parameters for user, they can either let the user supply command-line arguments that change application behavior, or there can be config files to keep that information for future use. Many applications such as services and daemons need configuration files at boot because  the config files will provide all the necessary information for service to perform its task. Controlling hardware, such as assigning stating IP to network card, is much easier and shorter with config file rather than doing that each and every time by yourself.</p>\n\n<p>As for <code>ls</code>, it's just due to history. Original <code>ls</code> did one and only thing - list files in the directory and creators didn't intend it to have config files, although it does have command-line arguments. POSIX standards makes <code>ls</code> as one of among basic commands required to be supported by Unix-like operating systems, and Ubuntu does provide <code>ls</code> to adhere to the standard. However, if someone wanted to make <code>ls</code> which implements POSIX features and also uses config files - they could very well do that.</p>\n"

            " <p>The answer is that you cannot do this at the moment, due to known bugs.</p>\n\n<p>I reported this <a href=\"https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=729423\" rel=\"nofollow\">bug</a> and it's been merged as a symptom of a bigger one:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is a monster bug about keyboard layouts in launchpad. Still basically\n  unsolved; the interactions between gnome-control-center, input methods, KBD\n  options and co&amp; are a real nightmare. </p>\n  \n  <p>The bug title is just one of the symptoms. The behavior reported here was\n  commented somewhere... at least I think. </p>\n  \n  <p>See\n  <a href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-settings-daemon/+bug/1218322\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-settings-daemon/+bug/1218322</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So while you can remove it, doing so does not fix the problem. Also, as the keyboard layout gets reset to US whenever Gnome Shell crashes and you can only remedy this by changing the layout back <em>to</em> US (the indicator does not register the reset) and then back to <em>UK</em> again, removing the indicator would not be convenient.</p>\n\n<p>I thought there might be a setting somewhere, which is why I asked the question, but it turns out it's a bug.</p>\n"

While running Ubuntu set to DHCP (which doesn't work), do the same with <code>ip addr</code>, <code>ip route</code> and <code>cat /etc/resolv.conf</code>. Compare the two to your router configuration to see where the difference might come from.</p>\n\n<p>As your /etc/resolv.conf says <code>nameserver 127.0.1.1</code> that shows you're running dnsmasq on Ubuntu (the default), so you'll have to check the dnsmasq configuration too. That's not so easy since it is managed dynamically by Network Manager via dbus, so there's no configuration file you can read, and regrettably there seems to be no way of querying dnsmasq's current configuration. Start by requesting a dnsmasq statistics reqort with</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo killall -URS1 dnsmasq\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and scanning the syslog for messages from dnsmasq with</p>\n\n<pre><code>grep dnsmasq /var/log/syslog\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>EDIT: Sorry I forgot about dnsmasq.

        "responses": [
            " <p><em>Beat around the bush</em> (meaning \"discuss a matter without coming to the point\") has been first used in 1570s; its sense has shifted from \"make preliminary motions\" to \"avoid, evade.\"<br>\nSee also <em>beat the bushes</em>, which is a way to rouse birds so that they fly into the net which others are holding.</p>\n\n<p><strong><sub>[Reference: <a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=beat+AND+bush+-busker+-rebuke&amp;searchmode=none\">Etymonline</a> and the <em>New Oxford American Dictionary</em>.]</sub></strong></p>\n",
            " <p>To get birds to fly up so they can be shot, hunters sometimes employ beaters who hit the roosts with sticks.  Beating the ground around the bush would also work (presumably), but would be slow and a waste of labour.</p>\n",
            " <p>Beating <em>AROUND</em> the bush is far less effective than the actual beating of the bush.  To get the job done more effectively, one must attack to the bush directly, not merely somewhere nearby.  </p>\n",
            " <p>The practice of beating bushes with sticks in order to put hiding birds to flight (so that they can be shot or netted) has given rise to two idioms with similar-sounding formulations but quite different connotations: <em>beat around [or about] the bush</em> and <em>beat the bushes [for]</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Dictionary discussions of the idioms</strong></em></p>\n<p>According to Christine Ammer, <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms</em> (1997), &quot;beat the bushes for&quot; is the older idiom:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>beat the bushes for</strong> Look everywhere for something or someone, as in <em>I've been beating the bushes for a substitute but haven't had any luck.</em> This term originally alluded to hunting, when beaters were hired to flush birds out of the brush. [1400s]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another idiom that has much the same meaning (and source in hunting) but arose much later is &quot;scare up,&quot; about which Ammer remarks:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first term [&quot;scare up&quot;] alludes to <em>scare</em> in the sense of &quot;flush game from cover&quot; and dates from the mid-1800s.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As for &quot;beat around the bush,&quot; Ammer has this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>beat around the bush</strong> Also <strong>beat about the bush</strong>. Approach indirectly, in a roundabout way, or too cautiously. For example, <em>Stop beating around the bush\u2014get to the point</em>. This term, first recorded in 1572, originally may have alluded to beating the bushes for game.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In contrast to Ammer, John Ayto, <em>Oxford Dictionary of Idioms</em>, third edition (2009), has no doubt that &quot;beat about the bush&quot; comes from hunting:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>beat about the bush</strong> discuss a matter without coming to the point; be ineffectual and waste time.</p>\n<p>This phrase is a metaphor which originated in the shooting or netting of birds; compare with <strong>beat the bushes</strong> below.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p><strong>beat the bushes</strong> search thoroughly <em>North American informal</em></p>\n<p>This expression originates from the way in which hunters walk through undergrowth wielding long sticks which are used to force birds or animals out into the open where they can be shot or netted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we have an odd situation where the same practical hunting activity has been adopted idiomatically to mean &quot;to take extensive direct action in pursuit of something&quot; and &quot;to take indirect measures to suggest or imply something.&quot;</p>\n<p>The <em>Cambridge International Book of Idioms</em> (1998) agrees with Ayto as to where &quot;beat the bushes&quot; arose:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>beat the bushes</strong> <em>American</em> to try very hard to get or achieve something [Example:] <em>She's not out there beating the bushes for a job \u2014 she's just as happy not working.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The North American origin of &quot;beat the bushes,&quot; which Oxford and Cambridge agree on, doesn't jibe with the 1400s first occurrence date that Ammer claims in <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms</em>. However, in Christine Ammer, <em>The Facts on File Dictionary of Clich\u00e9s</em>, second edition (2006), Ammer hedges a bit on the 1400s provenance of &quot;beat the bushes,&quot; saying that the phrase &quot;has been used in its literal sense since the fifteenth century.&quot; That is a far cry, of course, from identifying when it began to be used idiomatically in the sense of &quot;to seek out assiduously.&quot;</p>\n<p>In her <em>Dictionary of Clich\u00e9s</em>, Ammer also provides more detail about the earliest occurrence of &quot;beat about the bush&quot;:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>beat around/about the bush, to</strong> Indirection in word or deed; to shillyshally, to approach something in a roundabout way. This expression for overcautiousness dates from the early sixteenth century, when Robert Whytynton (<em>Vulgaria</em>, 1520) warned, &quot;a long betynge about the busshe and losse of time.&quot; Some authorities think it came from beating the bushes for game, and indeed there are numerous sayings concerning the delays caused by too much beating and not enough bird catching, dating back even further.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A fuller presentation of the statement by Whytynton (or Whittinton), as cited in Jane Griffiths, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=QxdoGDy9GdQC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=%22betynge+about+the%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=An2xVKOWConvoATas4LICg&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22betynge%20about%20the%22&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>John Skelton and Poetic Authority</em></a> (2006) shows that even at that date the phrase is already being used metaphorically or idiomatically:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imitacyon of autours without preceptes &amp; rules/is but a longe betynge about the busshe &amp; losse of tyme to a yonge beginner</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But Robert Hendrickson, <em>The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins</em> (1997) cites a rather more complicated origin of the term:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>beat around the bush.</strong> ... Hunters once hired beaters who &quot;started&quot; birds and other game for them by beating the bush and scaring them out into the open. The simplest explanation for the phrase <em>to beat around the bush</em>, to approach a matter very carefully or in a roundabout way, is that these beaters had to take great care when approaching the bush or they would &quot;start&quot; the game too soon for the hunter to get a good shot. But etymologist Ernest Weekley and others believe that the expression, which dates back to at least the early sixteenth century, is a mixed metaphor. Weekley suggests that the old proverb &quot;I will not beat the bush that another may have the bird&quot; joined with &quot;to around the bush,&quot; an early expression used for a hound hesitating when circling the bush \u2014 and gave us <em>beat around the bush</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Anne Baker, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=6t0LAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22beat+about+the+bush%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7MmxVPTwDITVoASh6IDoBQ&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCDge#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beat%20about%20the%20bush%22&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Glossary of Northamptonshire Words and Phrases</em></a> (1854) offers this interesting local sense of the phrase:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>BEAT. &quot;Beat about the bush;&quot; to reconnoitre; to endeavour to obtain information; or attain an object by circuitous means.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Instances of 'beating the bushes' in the wild</strong></em></p>\n<p>Given the early instances of &quot;beating the bushes&quot; and &quot;beating around the bushes&quot; cited by the dictionaries discussed above, one of the most surprising things about a Google Books search for the phrases is how late the earliest matches for each phrase are. Normally when an idiom is in use from the 1500s forward, the Google Books database will include a smattering of instances from the 1600s and many more from the early 1700s. But here, a search for &quot;beat the bushes&quot; turns up only a handful unique and confirmable matches before 1800. The first of these is from Gervase Markham, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=vm81AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR20&amp;dq=%22beat+the+bushes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=M7qxVMToDNO7ogTAy4GADA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beat%20the%20bushes%22&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Hunger's Prevention</em></a> (1621), cited in the introduction to an 1876 edition of <em>The Tempest</em>, apropos of a description of bat fowling (hunting for roosting birds at night):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thus being prepared [&quot;with long poales, very rough and bushy at the vpper ends&quot;] and comming into the Bushy, or rough ground where the haunts of Birds are, you shall then first kindle some of your fiers as halfe, or a third part, according as your provision is, and then with your other bushy and rough poales you shall <strong>beat the Bushes</strong>, Trees, and haunts of the Birds to enforce them to rise, which done you shall see the Birds which are raysed, to flye and play about the lights and flames of the fier, for it is their nature through their amazednesse, and affright at the strangenes of the light and the extreme darknesse round about it, not to depart from it, but as it were almost to scorch their wings in the same; so that those who have the rough bushye poales, may (at their pleasures) beat them down with the same, &amp; so take them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, from James Harrington, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=jl9NGI6MK0oC&amp;q=%22beat+the+bushes%22&amp;dq=%22beat+the+bushes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=boCxVOimIsbwoATMxoEI&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>The Commonwealth of Oceana</em></a> (1656):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is noted out of CICERO by Macchiavel, That the People, tho they are not so prone to find out Truth of themselves, as to follow Custom, or run into Error ; yet if they be shewn Truth, they not only acknowledge and imbrace it very suddenly, but are the most constant and faithful  Guardians and Conservators of it. It is your Duty and Office, wherto you are also qualify'd by the Orders of this Commonwealth, to have the People as you have your Hauks and Greyhounds, in Leases and Slips, to range the Fields, and <strong>beat the Bushes</strong> for them ; for they are of a nature that is never good at this spart, but when you spring or start their proper quarry. Think not that they will stand to ask you what it is, or less know it than your Hauks and Greyhounds do theirs ; but presently make such a flight or course, that a Huntsman may as well undertake to run with his Dogs, or a Falconer to fly with his Hauk, as an Aristocracy at this game to compare with the People.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the next four are from 1749, 1751, 1755, and 1769, and do not use the phrase metaphorically.

But if in your walks you meet a finer woman than ordinary, let her not escape till I have seen her.\u2014Wheresoe'er she is, she cannot long lie hid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And from a review quoting from Tobias Smollett, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=7uLPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA446&amp;dq=%22beat+the+bushes+and+discovered%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=i5ixVMq1LsXnoASj6IDIDA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beat%20the%20bushes%20and%20discovered%22&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>The History and Adventures of an Atom</em></a>, in <em>The Monthly Review</em> (June 1769):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The president Soo-san-sin-o, took notice, that if there had been one spaniel in the whole Japonese army, this disaster [a successful ambush by Chinese fighters] would not have happened ; as the animal would have <strong>beat the bushes</strong> and discovered the ambuscade.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <em>Rambler</em> and Smollett examples above are interesting because they explicitly refer to &quot;beating the bushes&quot; as being a task performed not by paid human workers but by trained greyhounds and spaniels. But the Fielding and Hoadley examples involve human beaters.</p>\n<p>The earliest nonliteral use of &quot;beat the bushes&quot; (after Harrington's from 1656) in the Google Books search results occurs in the late 1800s. On the strength of this record, it's hard to see why Ammer, Ayto, and Cambridge consider &quot;beat the bushes&quot; a North American idiom.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Instances of 'beating about/around the bush' in the wild</strong></em></p>\n<p>The two earliest instance of &quot;beat about the bush&quot; in Google Books search results are from 1821 and 1822.

It is not consistent with my principles or practice thus to &quot;<strong>beat about the bush</strong>;&quot; and the whole purpose that we had in speaking of treasury matters, was to shew the defects of the system\u2014wretchedly managed, perhaps, from its own wretched nature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A decade later, from John Taylor, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=1a9pAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=%22beat+about+the+bush%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0cyxVMifBZXloAS40IHoCA&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAjha#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beat%20about%20the%20bush%22&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Records of My Life</em></a> (1833):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Thomas] King possessed a shrewd mind, and copied his characters from real life, and from manners of any of his predecessors.

That meaning pops up (metaphorically) in James St. John, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=MubOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=%22beat+about+the+bush%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tdGxVLvfA46qogSl8ILABQ&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwATiMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beat%20about%20the%20bush%22&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>The History of the Manners and Customs of Ancient Greece</em></a>, volume 2 (1842):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A crown, an extra junket, and the applause of the company, cheered the successful \u0152dipos [in riddle-solving contests], while the lackwit who <strong>beat about the bush</strong> without catching the owl, had to make wry faces over a cup of brine or pickle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the generalized idiom returns, very modern in tone, in Charles Dickens, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=U9UWAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=%22beat+about+the+bush%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hdOxVJH0D4nwoASd6ICQBA&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAjigAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beat%20about%20the%20bush%22&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>The Old Curiosity Shop</em></a>, in <em>Master Humphrey's Clock</em> (1841):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The girl [little Nell] has strong affections, and, brought up as she has been, may at her age be easily influenced and persuaded.

Not to <strong>beat about the bush</strong> (for the advantages of the scheme would take a week to tell), what's to prevent your marrying her?&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Beat around the bush&quot; appears to have been (initially at least) a U.S. variant of &quot;beat about the bush.&quot; It first shows up in Google Books search results in books from the 1860s.

If we intend to do this, let us do it directly; let us march up manfully to it, not <strong>beat around the bush</strong>, not evade it, but walk up to it and say that notwithstanding the provision, it was unwisely made, and we will put our heel upon it and crush it out of the Constitution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And from &quot;<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=hcY_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA529&amp;dq=%22beat+around+the+bush%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XduxVKj5JoW7ogSSvoK4CA&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beat%20around%20the%20bush%22&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Notabilia</a>,&quot; in <em>The Examiner</em> (August 19, 1865):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>MEXICO.\u2014Advices received in New York state that Lopez had defeated Cortenas, and the latter had fled to the Texas side of the river. During an entertainment given to the Republican Mexican General Ortega, in New York, on the 3rd inst., the following extract from a letter from General Sheridan, commanding the Federal troops on the Rio Grande, was read : &quot;It is of no use to <strong>beat around the bush</strong> in this Mexican matter; we should give a permanent Government to that Republic. Our work in crushing the rebellion will not be done until this takes place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Conclusions</strong></em></p>\n<p>Though authorities find instances of &quot;beating the bushes&quot; and &quot;beating about/around the bush&quot; that go back at least four centuries, neither expression seems to have been especially common in published works between roughly 1660 and 1750 (in the case of &quot;beat the bushes&quot;) and not until the 1820s for &quot;beat about the bush&quot;; &quot;beat around the bush&quot; begins to appear some 40 years after that.</p>\n<p>Some of the examples suggest that all three expressions may have a common root meaning of flushing prey out of hiding, but the separation into the meanings &quot;expend considerable effort on&quot; and &quot;ask or seek information indirectly&quot; seems to have happened early in the 1800s usage of &quot;beat about the bush.&quot;</p>\n"

Many people remarked upon its considerable shagginess. When the boy learned that there are contests for shaggy dogs, he entered his dog. The dog won first prize for shagginess in both the local and the regional competitions. The boy entered the dog in ever-larger contests, until finally he entered it in the world championship for shaggy dogs. When the judges had inspected all of the competing dogs, they remarked about the boy's dog: \"He's not that shaggy.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The specific events in the story might change every time you tell the story; it's more like a template for improvisation than a set narrative. Properly told, this story could last five, ten, or even fifteen minutes. You can imagine the anticlimax at the end. The teller, leading up to it, might begin to feign repressed giggles, cover his or her mouth for a moment, and generally behave as if the coming punchline is the funniest thing imaginable. </p>\n\n<p>This doesn't seem to be a <em>perfect</em> translation, since the kinds of jokes you're talking about might not be that long; a shaggy dog story is almost always long. Still, the concept seems quite similar to me.</p>\n",

It ends with an anti-climax, a horrible pun, or some other unexpectedly un-funny result.</p>\n\n<p>The reaction is then a cross between a laugh and a groan.

What if I used \"That\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That was too stupid question.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>3) Do I still need to use the article?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>In general, when you use a countable noun in the singular, you must put some indication of quantity in front of it. When you use it in the plural, you may give a quantity or not. By \"countable noun\", I mean a noun that refers to something that can be counted, like dogs or bricks, as opposed to things like liquids that perhaps can be measured but not counted. By \"indication of quantity\" I mean a number, like \"one\" or \"six\"; an article, namely \"a\" or \"the\"; or some other word that indicates a quantity in some general sense, like \"many\" or \"some\".</p>\n\n<p>In this case, \"not a big deal\" uses an article to express the quantity, namely, one. \"No big deal\" uses the word \"no\" to express the quantity, namely, zero.</p>\n\n<p>So in your \"stupid question\" example (I'm referring to the example you give, not your question!), yes, you need an article or some other \"quantity\" word. Normally you would say, \"That was too stupid a question\" or \"That was a stupid question\". </p>\n\n<p>Note that you don't necessarily need a quantity when you use the plural. For example in the singular you cannot say, \"There was dog in the room\", you must say, \"There was a dog in the room\" or \"There was one dog in the room\". But in the plural you can say, \"There were dogs in the room.\" You CAN give a quantity, like \"There were two dogs in the room\" or \"There were many dogs in the room\", but you don't have to. (I have no idea why this is so. It's just the rule.)</p>\n",
            " <p>I think the simple answer to this is that you <em>do</em> need to use the article, but that one definition of <em>no</em> is \"not a\", meaning that using <em>no</em> on its own can imply the article anyway, as in:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He's no genius. (He's not a genius)<br>\n  It's no joke. (It's not a joke)<br>\n  No one may leave. (Not a/any one/person may leave)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, you can say \"It's no big deal\", as you may also say \"It was no stupid question\", but because no definitions of <em>too</em> include an article, you have to explicitly use the article with <em>too</em>.</p>\n",
            " <p>For what it might be worth, I find that \"of a deal\" is a prepositional phrase that modifies the adjective \"big\"; you would be left with the main sentence, \"It's not that big.\"  While adjectives can certainly be used as nouns (\"the good, the bad, and the ugly\"), this is usually the case when there is an understood noun to which the adjectives apply (\"people\").  \"It's not that big.\" is a bit awkward and very conversational, on the level of \"no big\".  I prefer \"It's not that big a deal.\" as the more straightforward option.  However the comment in the thread noting that English tends to be defined by usage is right, so way what you will.</p>\n"

There is a more general technique that can fix almost any animation bug, but only on PC. Open the console and run this command:</p>\n<pre><code>pushactoraway player 1\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then close the console and wait for the player to finish the &quot;stand up&quot; animation (it takes a few seconds). In the vast majority of situations, this will completely fix the problem, because it puts the player into a ragdoll state and cancels any ongoing animations. However, you should consider the following caveats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always save the game before using the console.</li>\n<li>If you are swimming (or in a glitched running-underwater state), get to dry land first. This technique will not fix swim states, and may actually break them.</li>\n<li>I have not extensively tested how this interacts with mounts. If you are riding a horse or dragon, this might not work as expected.</li>\n<li>If your character is in an animation-driven state (i.e. you can't move around normally because the dragonborn is &quot;doing something&quot; like using a forge or sitting on a chair), then it is probably safer to get to a movement-driven state first. In other words, close the crafting menu, stand up from the chair, etc., so that your character moves normally when you hit the WASD keys (or manipulate the joystick on your gamepad).</li>\n<li>If you use mods which trigger custom animations, arm offsets, etc., then this might cause issues with those mods if they do not correctly handle the &quot;get up&quot; animation. That would be a bug in the mod, because Unrelenting Force (which can be used against the player by certain draugr) can also trigger the ragdoll state, so those mods should already be handling it correctly anyway.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Non-PC players can probably get away with saving and reloading the game, but you might need to completely exit the game (or restart the console) as well, because animation state might persist over a save/load.</p>\n<p>You can replace &quot;player&quot; with the refID of a misbehaving NPC, if you want to fix their animations instead. Unfortunately, clicking on NPCs to target them does not work for the purposes of this command (instead, it sets the point from which the Havok impulse originates, which is largely useless as we just want to trigger the ragdoll state).</p>\n"

I wonder why they don't use other shouts such as Slow Time or Unrelenting Force, that will make battles more challenging. </p>\n\n<p>If I am learning words of power as Dragonborn, and those words are part of dragons language, why they don't use it against me? Alduin for example uses his version of Storm Call and the shout for resurrecting dragons, but why is he the only one? I find odd that common dragons don't \"speak\" words of power in their own language.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>[Speculation Abounds]</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned in the comments, the Dragons in the game were originally meant to have the Unrelenting Force shout as a power, but this was removed in favour of only being able to use more \"traditional\" powers - the \"breath\" shouts.</p>\n\n<p>A theory for this can be developed by looking at the storyline.</p>\n\n<p>When the player reads the Elder scroll, he is teleported back in time to the end of the Dragon War, when Alduin was \"Defeated\". This led to The eventual defeat of all Dragons (save Paarthurnax). However, Alduin was <em>not</em> defeated, he was simply pushed through time, to the present day.</p>\n\n<p>When he arrives, he is capable of summoning forth meteor storms, and even raising the dead - this is because from his perspective, he only \"vanished\" for a short period of time - he is still at the height of his power. The other Dragons, however, have been dead for centuries.</p>\n\n<p>Dragons are believed to have a close affinity to magic. But, if left dead for long periods of time, it would make sense that much of their power has left them, and needs to be restored. It would then make sense why a handful of mere mortals would be able to kill one on a simple reconnaissance mission. </p>\n\n<p>This is further supported by the idea that while dragons fighting could be described as a \"heated debate\", but I would argue that there would have to be some form of residual power involved in using a Thu'um - otherwise that Dragonborn would likely be killing a lot more people simply by sneezing violently.</p>\n\n<p>So, my belief is that Dragons require some level of affinity with Magic to be able to use the Thu'um to it's full effect, which does require time, and training.</p>\n",

Some of these reasons are based on game restrictions, other based on what we know about the dragons.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Animal_Allegiance\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Animal Allegiance</a> - Dragons spend their lives flying and living on mountains - it's very unlikely they'd spend much time around animals</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Aura_Whisper\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aura Whisper</a> - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chekhov's Gun</a> - the player would never know they were using it, plus they have an aerial view and can see almost everything</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Dragonborn:Battle_Fury\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Battle Fury</a> - As soon as dragons start wielding swords I'm sure they'll find a use for this one</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Become_Ethereal\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Become Ethereal</a> - Dragons are destructive by nature, this shout prevents them from destroying anything - it would be illogical for them to use it</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Dragonborn:Bend_Will\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bend Will</a> - This wouldn't work against the player so would be immersion breaking</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Call_Dragon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Call Dragon</a> - I imagine any dragon could call another but there's no reason during the game for this to happen</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Call_of_Valor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Call of Valor</a> - Even if the dragons used this, I doubt the hero would obey - there's no evidence that the hero is forced onto Mundus, instead the name suggests they are <em>requested</em>, just like Odahving isn't forced to answer your call</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Clear_Skies\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Clear Skies</a> - I imagine a dragon might enjoy an evening fly through the clear skies, however since most flying dragons you encounter are hostile they'll probably want to use the weather to their advantage</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Dragonborn:Cyclone\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Cyclone</a> - This would probably be too overpowered against the player and make the game overly difficult</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Disarm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Disarm</a> - This seems like it would have been very useful for dragons during the Dragon War. They may be unable to comprehend it, like Dragonrend, since dragons cannot use weapons themselves</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dismay\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dismay</a> - You can't kill something if it's running in fear, and dragons aren't known for \"killing for sport\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Dragonborn:Dragon_Aspect\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dragon Aspect</a> - How can a dragon look more like a dragon?</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragonrend\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dragonrend</a> - As we see in game, dragons cannot comprehend this shout</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Drain_Vitality\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Drain Vitality</a> - Higher level dragons do use this</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Elemental_Fury\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Elemental Fury</a> - Dragons posses neither arms nor weapons</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Fire_Breath\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Fire Breath</a> - They do use this</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Frost_Breath\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Frost Breath</a> - They do use this</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ice_Form\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ice Form</a> - Since attacking enemies under the effects of Ice Form dispels the effect it would be superfluous for dragons who just attack relentlessly with little regard for tactic</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Kyne%27s_Peace\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kyne's Peace</a> - It is not in a dragons nature to be peaceful</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Marked_for_Death\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Marked for Death</a> - The armour reduction is a bit useless against magical dragon attacks</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Slow_Time\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Slow Time</a> - It would be great for dragons to use this but I think it would be impossible to show when the perspective is someone's other than the player</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Soul_Tear\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soul Tear</a> - Given the relation to souls it likely that it was given to Durnehviir by the Ideal Masters within the Soul Cairn</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Storm_Call\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Storm Call</a> - So Alduin uses his version of this, so why not other dragons? Well, we know that he jealously guards his access to Sovngarde from Skuldafn, which happens to be the location of the third word - seems that he guards that little benefit too</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Summon_Durnehviir\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Summon Durnehviir</a> - Same as \"Call Dragon\" - why would we witness a dragon using this shout? There's no reason for it</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Throw_Voice\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Throw Voice</a> - Dragons are rather large and noisy - I don't think anyone would be fooled by this shout</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Unrelenting_Force\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Unrelenting Force</a> - Many dragons can use this but prefer to use damaging shouts instead as they are destructive by nature and not particularly tactical</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Whirlwind_Sprint\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Whirlwind Sprint</a> - Dragons already move pretty quickly, I think this would have made battles overly long and boring</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, all of that being said, there are a few of those shouts that I think dragons would find useful outside of game restrictions (ie lore):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Aura Whisper - Basically turns the dragon into a heat-seeking missile</li>\n<li>Bend Will - Suits the dominant dragons</li>\n<li>Call Dragon - If one dragon fancies a \"brawl\" or if they need help after picking a fight with <a href=\"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Braith\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Braith</a></li>\n<li>Clear Skies - When not in battle I'm sure dragons would prefer a cloud-free sky</li>\n<li>Cyclone - Because, well, do you need a reason?</li>\n<li>Disarm - Would have been invaluable in the Dragon War against men</li>\n<li>Slow Time - Would be very advantageous to a dragon</li>\n<li>Whirlwind Sprint - If some speed is good then more must be better!</li>\n</ul>\n"

Butterflies spawn during the day, while Moths spawn at night.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Butterflies will take several days to spawn</strong></em> - The user reports 3 days. This is in-game time, so try sleeping for a day, three times.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Butterflies spawn depending on what plants have been planted</strong></em> - a few users report this to not be the case, but one user has a particular experience:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Overlord_Meril</strong></em> says: <em>&quot;I've got two greenhouses, one has purple mountain flowers and wheat. Lots of bees and butterflies show up. But none show up in my other greenhouse that grows imp stool, canis root &amp; mora tapinella.&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Butterflies spawn depending on what furniture you have</strong></em> - There were reports that <em>removing certain furniture</em> would have an effect. While this has been disproven, the original requirement behind spawning butterflies is to furnish the Greenhouse.</p>\n<p><strong>It is entirely possible you have ran into a bug preventing the butterflies from spawning</strong>. If all else fails, it might be worth removing some of the furnishings. Once removed, add it back in. If you &quot;reset&quot; the spawn trigger, you can sometimes get around weird bugs.</p>\n",

Butterflies spawn during the day, while Moths spawn at night.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Butterflies will take several days to spawn</strong></em> - The user reports 3 days. This is in-game time, so try sleeping for a day, three times.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Butterflies spawn depending on what plants have been planted</strong></em> - a few users report this to not be the case, but one user has a particular experience:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Overlord_Meril</strong></em> says: <em>&quot;I've got two greenhouses, one has purple mountain flowers and wheat. Lots of bees and butterflies show up. But none show up in my other greenhouse that grows imp stool, canis root &amp; mora tapinella.&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Butterflies spawn depending on what furniture you have</strong></em> - There were reports that <em>removing certain furniture</em> would have an effect. While this has been disproven, the original requirement behind spawning butterflies is to furnish the Greenhouse.</p>\n<p><strong>It is entirely possible you have ran into a bug preventing the butterflies from spawning</strong>. If all else fails, it might be worth removing some of the furnishings. Once removed, add it back in. If you &quot;reset&quot; the spawn trigger, you can sometimes get around weird bugs.</p>\n",

            " <p>may be it's too late but i think this question \"does not take old\"...\nAOE was criticized for the earliest versions because in the hard/hardest mode it does not take too much to beat the AI, so some cheating was introduced in \"Age of the kings\"(that's my own opinion).\nI can tell that because AI players can upgrade to feudal age since the first 5 mn easily(for any civilization) while human player can not do that with his resources(250 food !)[ less than the required 500 ].to prove that,start a new game ,in hardest mode ,and quit immediately ,then read the screen of the statistics ,you will find out that AI players have well higher scores because they were given more resources ! \nAnother thing to mention is that AI managed units/buildings are some how \"auto-healing\" or \"auto-reparing\" and more efficient but it's not a bad thing,instead this makes the game more attractive and invites the human intelligence to improve each time and finest the strategy ! </p>\n",
            " <p>I would say the CPU never cheats, but you have to remember while your human\nclicks only control one thing at a time, the CPU is controlling everything\neverywhere always.

Damage, defense, healing? Or maybe a mix? Tho, again, it boils down to your play style.</p>\n\n<p>I'd dare say, due to elementalist's flexibility, it is better to just pick a race, and prepare a spec around that.

            " <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: <em>I'd like to preface this by saying that, practically speaking, the races are on even footing as an Elementalist. None of the current meta builds for WvW include using any racial skills since our class-specific utilities are too great to pass up. However, in the spirit of the question, it is possible to justify a &quot;best&quot; race. Just don't expect it to grant you better performance than any other race.</em></p>\n<p>In order to answer which race is the best race, we have to first consider what your race actually does. Your race in GW2 affects a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your physical appearance</li>\n<li>Racial-locked skins</li>\n<li>The first half of your personal story</li>\n<li>Racial skills</li>\n<li>Certain NPC conversation options</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, we have to consider what we mean by &quot;best.&quot; My assumption is that &quot;best&quot; means &quot;most effective,&quot; and &quot;most effective&quot; includes damage output, survivability, and mobility. As such, only some of the above elements apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your physical appearance</li>\n<li>Racial skills</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, let's assume that by saying &quot;best,&quot; we are agreeing to use the WvW meta builds of Dagger/Dagger roaming or Staff zerging. Anything else is out of the realm of &quot;best.&quot;</p>\n<h1>Physical Appearance</h1>\n<p>The part of your physical appearance that is relevant to your success in PvP would be your visibility. Low visibility improves your survivability as players will attack you less frequently as they do not notice you. It also grants you more opportunity to scout without being spotted. Also, smaller characters' animations are harder to see or interpret, meaning your opponents won't notice the telegraphs of your abilities as easily.</p>\n<p>Shorter characters have less vertical visibility. Thinner characters have less horizontal visibility. At a far distance, your nameplate is not visible and players will have to recognize you purely by your silhouette. As such, you want to be non-noticeable. Technically, your character's skin color and armor color could help them camoflauge. However, a player can select their settings to show team colors which overrides your armor coloring. So, we won't include colors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asura are small in stature. They are the smallest race, and therefore the least visible.</li>\n<li>Charr are the second tallest race. They are also the widest race and very visible.</li>\n<li>Norns are the tallest race. They will easily stand out against a clear background.</li>\n<li>Humans and Sylvari are the same height, but larger than Asura.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In terms of visibility, <strong>Asura</strong> is the best choice.</p>\n<h1>Racial Skills</h1>\n<p>So, physically, Asura is the best race. However, visibility doesn't matter much once you've been spotted. You will need to fight or escape! As such, racial skills might improve your effectiveness.</p>\n<h3>Asuran Racial Skills</h3>\n<p>Asuran utility skills grant an Elementalist access to Confusion, Retaliation, Poison, Weakness, and a long-ranged Daze. The elite skills give you a summonable golem or the <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Summon_Power_Suit\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Power Suit</a>.</p>\n<h3>Charr Racial Skills</h3>\n<p>Charr utility skills have one that grants extra Fury and Might, an extra 15-second cooldown evade with damage attached to it, and a bleeding trap. The elite skills can fire a ground-targeted AoE, conjure a weapon, or summon minions.</p>\n<h3>Norn Racial Skills</h3>\n<p>Norn utility skills grant access to an extra bleed and an summoned (immobile, but powerful) minion. The elite skills are all shape-shifting skills that <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/List_of_norn_racial_skills#Auxiliary_skillbars\" rel=\"noreferrer\">grant new abilities</a> with knockback, knockdown, cripple, daze, life-steal, and bleeds, however no one form has them all.</p>\n<h3>Human Racial Skills</h3>\n<p>Human has a healing skill that is a 30-second cooldown casted burst heal. The utility skills include a condition removal and a random condition + boon applier. The elite skills include <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Avatar_of_Melandru\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a transformation</a>, a minion summon, and an unblockable chill + poison applier.</p>\n<h3>Sylvari Racial Skills</h3>\n<p>Sylvari also has a healing skill that provides rooted regeneration near a targeted location. The utility skills include an immobilize and summoned turrets. The elite skills include one skill that summons multiple turrets, and others that summon minions.</p>\n<h2>Skill Usefulness</h2>\n<p>Many of these skills are essentially useless to Elementalists because we can already do them, regardless of race.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Summoning Minions</strong>: All skills that summon minions pale in comparison to <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glyph_of_Elementals\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Glyph of Elementals</a> and <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glyph_of_Lesser_Elementals\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Glyph of Lesser Elementals</a> because the Glyphs allow you to situationally select an Elemental based on your attunement. All other summons pigeonhole you into a single selection.</li>\n<li><strong>Conditions</strong>: Some skills give you access to conditions. As Dagger/Dagger and staff, you will already have access to Weakness, Fury (from <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Arcane_Fury\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Arcane Fury</a>, one point into Arcane), Chill, and Bleeding. Dagger/Dagger also has access to Immobilize (they have access to other conditions as well, these are just the ones the racial skills provide). Dagger/Dagger typically uses <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sigil_of_Doom\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sigil of Doom</a> to apply Poison passively and continuously during combat.</li>\n<li><strong>Weapon conjures</strong>: Elementalists are the weapon-conjuring class. Weapon conjuring skills are useful for other classes, but not Elementalists.</li>\n<li><strong>Heals</strong>: Since you cannot have the racial heals alongside the Elementalist-specific heals, I'd argue they are useless. The two most used heals for meta builds are <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Signet_of_Restoration\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Signet of Restoration</a> and <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ether_Renewal\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ether Renewal</a>. The Human 1-second cast heal and the Sylvari range-limited Regeneration can't match up to the effectiveness of these.</li>\n<li><strong>Knockback</strong>: Dagger/Dagger and Staff both have access to knockback.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, what is left?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Asura</strong>: 3 stacks of Confusion on a 30-second cooldown and 1200 range Daze. Also, transformation elite.</li>\n<li><strong>Charr</strong>: Extra evade on a 15-second cooldown.</li>\n<li><strong>Norn</strong>: Transformation elites.</li>\n<li><strong>Human</strong>: Transformation elite.</li>\n<li><strong>Sylvari</strong>: Turrets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Considering so many races have transformation elites, let's take a look at that. You only get one elite, so to use a transformation elite means that you don't use <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glyph_of_Elementals\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Glyph of Elementals</a> or <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fiery_Greatsword\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Fiery Greatsword</a>. Roaming Dagger/Dagger almost requires the Greatsword for mobility as Elementalists have a criminally low amount of access to Swiftness without traiting for it and not nearly same mobility as Thieves or Warriors with the Greatsword. And Staff Elementalists don't really get in-your-face, meaning that going into a transformation would force them to go into melee and then back to range after the transformation is over.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, <strong>transformation elites are a wasted elite slot</strong> (unless transforming into a <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tornado\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tornado</a>, but even that is weaker now than it once was).</p>\n<p>At this point, we are left with just the following abilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Asura</strong>: 3 stacks of Confusion on a 30-second cooldown and 1200-range Daze.</li>\n<li><strong>Charr</strong>: Extra evade on a 15-second cooldown.</li>\n<li><strong>Sylvari</strong>: Turrets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In my opinion, none of these are particularly great. However, if we are strictly comparing the races to each other, it would appear that Asura has more viable Utility options than the other races.</p>\n<h1>So, who's the best?</h1>\n<p><strong>Asura</strong> is the best in terms of visibility and Utility.

        "sft_target": " <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: <em>I'd like to preface this by saying that, practically speaking, the races are on even footing as an Elementalist. None of the current meta builds for WvW include using any racial skills since our class-specific utilities are too great to pass up. However, in the spirit of the question, it is possible to justify a &quot;best&quot; race. Just don't expect it to grant you better performance than any other race.</em></p>\n<p>In order to answer which race is the best race, we have to first consider what your race actually does. Your race in GW2 affects a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your physical appearance</li>\n<li>Racial-locked skins</li>\n<li>The first half of your personal story</li>\n<li>Racial skills</li>\n<li>Certain NPC conversation options</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, we have to consider what we mean by &quot;best.&quot; My assumption is that &quot;best&quot; means &quot;most effective,&quot; and &quot;most effective&quot; includes damage output, survivability, and mobility. As such, only some of the above elements apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your physical appearance</li>\n<li>Racial skills</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, let's assume that by saying &quot;best,&quot; we are agreeing to use the WvW meta builds of Dagger/Dagger roaming or Staff zerging. Anything else is out of the realm of &quot;best.&quot;</p>\n<h1>Physical Appearance</h1>\n<p>The part of your physical appearance that is relevant to your success in PvP would be your visibility. Low visibility improves your survivability as players will attack you less frequently as they do not notice you. It also grants you more opportunity to scout without being spotted. Also, smaller characters' animations are harder to see or interpret, meaning your opponents won't notice the telegraphs of your abilities as easily.</p>\n<p>Shorter characters have less vertical visibility. Thinner characters have less horizontal visibility. At a far distance, your nameplate is not visible and players will have to recognize you purely by your silhouette. As such, you want to be non-noticeable. Technically, your character's skin color and armor color could help them camoflauge. However, a player can select their settings to show team colors which overrides your armor coloring. So, we won't include colors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asura are small in stature. They are the smallest race, and therefore the least visible.</li>\n<li>Charr are the second tallest race. They are also the widest race and very visible.</li>\n<li>Norns are the tallest race. They will easily stand out against a clear background.</li>\n<li>Humans and Sylvari are the same height, but larger than Asura.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In terms of visibility, <strong>Asura</strong> is the best choice.</p>\n<h1>Racial Skills</h1>\n<p>So, physically, Asura is the best race. However, visibility doesn't matter much once you've been spotted. You will need to fight or escape! As such, racial skills might improve your effectiveness.</p>\n<h3>Asuran Racial Skills</h3>\n<p>Asuran utility skills grant an Elementalist access to Confusion, Retaliation, Poison, Weakness, and a long-ranged Daze. The elite skills give you a summonable golem or the <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Summon_Power_Suit\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Power Suit</a>.</p>\n<h3>Charr Racial Skills</h3>\n<p>Charr utility skills have one that grants extra Fury and Might, an extra 15-second cooldown evade with damage attached to it, and a bleeding trap. The elite skills can fire a ground-targeted AoE, conjure a weapon, or summon minions.</p>\n<h3>Norn Racial Skills</h3>\n<p>Norn utility skills grant access to an extra bleed and an summoned (immobile, but powerful) minion. The elite skills are all shape-shifting skills that <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/List_of_norn_racial_skills#Auxiliary_skillbars\" rel=\"noreferrer\">grant new abilities</a> with knockback, knockdown, cripple, daze, life-steal, and bleeds, however no one form has them all.</p>\n<h3>Human Racial Skills</h3>\n<p>Human has a healing skill that is a 30-second cooldown casted burst heal. The utility skills include a condition removal and a random condition + boon applier. The elite skills include <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Avatar_of_Melandru\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a transformation</a>, a minion summon, and an unblockable chill + poison applier.</p>\n<h3>Sylvari Racial Skills</h3>\n<p>Sylvari also has a healing skill that provides rooted regeneration near a targeted location. The utility skills include an immobilize and summoned turrets. The elite skills include one skill that summons multiple turrets, and others that summon minions.</p>\n<h2>Skill Usefulness</h2>\n<p>Many of these skills are essentially useless to Elementalists because we can already do them, regardless of race.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Summoning Minions</strong>: All skills that summon minions pale in comparison to <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glyph_of_Elementals\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Glyph of Elementals</a> and <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glyph_of_Lesser_Elementals\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Glyph of Lesser Elementals</a> because the Glyphs allow you to situationally select an Elemental based on your attunement.

Damage, defense, healing? Or maybe a mix? Tho, again, it boils down to your play style.</p>\n\n<p>I'd dare say, due to elementalist's flexibility, it is better to just pick a race, and prepare a spec around that.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Belial is the guy at the end of act 2, and the last part is really hard.  I never seem to get his life very low.  How do you beat him as a monk?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <h3>Stage 1</h3>\n<p>Kill all the worms which is trivial.</p>\n<h3>Stage 2</h3>\n<p>Focus on Belial and let your companions handle the little guys for the most part.  Make sure at the end of this round you are full on spirit or else you'll be in much worse shape.</p>\n<h3>Stage 3</h3>\n<p>From what I can tell, Belial has 3 main abilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whack you</li>\n<li>Spit green stuff in sweeping motion</li>\n<li>Green exploding void zones</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It requires a little concentration, but if you counter each one individually, it's much easier.</p>\n<p>When he whacks you, you are in his melee range and it doesn't hit very hard, so you can basically ignore it.</p>\n<p>When he spews green stuff, make sure you 300 life and you should live through it.</p>\n<p>The green exploding void zones are the hard part.  These will tag you for bleeding damage while you are standing in them and then they pop you for 500-600 when they explode.  The only real strategy for these is to run away from them.  I have found that running around the outer edge of his zone gives you the most room to work with and tends to be a lot less busy so you can see yourself the whole time.</p>\n<p><strong>This is not a DPS fight!</strong>  Focus on keeping yourself at full life.  I used the aura that heals you when you use spirit and the one that gives you 100 extra spirit.  I don't think the mantras I had at this point are particularly useful for this fight, but I used the one that increases dodge to help with the first 2 stages.  I also used the aura companion spell and the heal party spell.  I had the enchantress follower with me.</p>\n<p>The basic strategy is to keep your spirit capped off, and as soon as you take damage, blow some spirit.   During the slow parts, run up to him and build your spirit back up.  Don't forget to use your potion if you get into trouble and don't worry about your companions, they will figure it out.  The last piece of advice is to not go crazy and blow all your heals when you take damage.  If he hits you with a whack as you are lighting up your spirit orb or you take a green spit, just cast a single damage spell that uses spirit and save the big cool downs for when you are running away from the green voids.</p>\n<p>Lastly, health globes do pop up in melee range quite often.  It's more important to keep yourself topped off than it is to DPS.</p>\n",

It removes you from the area for a few seconds and has saved my life at least once when both heals and my health potion were on cooldown</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/class/monk/passive/transcendence\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Transcendence</a> - This passive makes it so you almost always full-heal with any of the 3 skills listed above</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The important bit was to save your spirit for heals, and just auto-attack for damage and spirit generation.</p>\n\n<p>And a side note, be sure your best quality health potion is equipped in your Q slot.

Make sure at the end of this round you are full on spirit or else you'll be in much worse shape.</p>\n<h3>Stage 3</h3>\n<p>From what I can tell, Belial has 3 main abilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whack you</li>\n<li>Spit green stuff in sweeping motion</li>\n<li>Green exploding void zones</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It requires a little concentration, but if you counter each one individually, it's much easier.</p>\n<p>When he whacks you, you are in his melee range and it doesn't hit very hard, so you can basically ignore it.</p>\n<p>When he spews green stuff, make sure you 300 life and you should live through it.</p>\n<p>The green exploding void zones are the hard part.  These will tag you for bleeding damage while you are standing in them and then they pop you for 500-600 when they explode.  The only real strategy for these is to run away from them.  I have found that running around the outer edge of his zone gives you the most room to work with and tends to be a lot less busy so you can see yourself the whole time.</p>\n<p><strong>This is not a DPS fight!</strong>  Focus on keeping yourself at full life.  I used the aura that heals you when you use spirit and the one that gives you 100 extra spirit.  I don't think the mantras I had at this point are particularly useful for this fight, but I used the one that increases dodge to help with the first 2 stages.  I also used the aura companion spell and the heal party spell.  I had the enchantress follower with me.</p>\n<p>The basic strategy is to keep your spirit capped off, and as soon as you take damage, blow some spirit.   During the slow parts, run up to him and build your spirit back up.  Don't forget to use your potion if you get into trouble and don't worry about your companions, they will figure it out.  The last piece of advice is to not go crazy and blow all your heals when you take damage.  If he hits you with a whack as you are lighting up your spirit orb or you take a green spit, just cast a single damage spell that uses spirit and save the big cool downs for when you are running away from the green voids.</p>\n<p>Lastly, health globes do pop up in melee range quite often.  It's more important to keep yourself topped off than it is to DPS.</p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p>People frequently speak about an atomic system decaying from an excited state to the ground state. However, both the ground states and the excited states are defined as eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator for the system. This implies then that up to a time-dependent complex phase, they are invariant under evolution according to the Hamiltonian for the system. How can it be then that there is a decay from an excited state to a ground state?</p>\n\n<p>I have tried to give this an interpretation in terms of unstable equilibrium (that is, if we have a excited state, it is actually an eigenstate, but if we modify it a little bit, it becomes something will evolve to the ground state). However, I don't think this works, since the evolution under the Hamiltonian of the system will leave invariant (up to a time-dependent complex phase) the amplitudes of the state when expanded in a basis of eigenstates.</p>\n\n<p>My current guess is that it is necessary to consider some kind of noise to explain this, but I don't have any idea about how would the particular details work.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>The true eigenstates, when they exist, don't decay. They sit and spin around in phase forever. But atomic eigenstates are not true eigenstates. The reason atomic states decay is because they are coupled to photon states, and the combined photon-atom Hamiltonian doesn't have excited atom eigenstates.</p>\n\n<p>When you have an atom in a box of mirrors, there are true eigenstates of the combined photon-atom system inside the box. These are states where a quantum of energy is absorbed by the atom, remitted into the box, in a steady way, so that it is sometimes in the atom, sometimes in the photons of the box. But when you make the box big, the energy will be in the photons nearly all the time, and the atom will be in its ground state, just because there are infinitely many more photon states than atomic states. In the limit of no box, the excited atomic states are never true eigenstates, they always decay into photons irreversibly. This process was described by Fermi, and the rate of irreversible decay is given by Fermi's golden rule.</p>\n\n<p>For atoms and radiation, the coupling is mostly by a term in the Hamiltonian equal to $p\\cdot A(x)$, where p is the momentum of the electron and A is the vector potential at the position of the electron, plus a direct two-photon term $A(x)^2$ which you can usually ignore. You evaluate the transition by expanding A in plane waves, the coefficients of which are photon creation operators, and approximating the exponential of the X operator by the first two terms of a Taylor expansion. This is called the dipole approximation.</p>\n\n<p>The resulting Hamiltonian describes transitions between the pure atom stationary states into states of the atom plus a photon, and for long times, the transitions conserve energy, so that the outgoing photon carries the energy difference that is lost by the decay. The dipole approximation is essentially exact for transitions which are dipole-allowed because the atomic motion is nonrelativistic, so that the wavelength of the light is enormous compared to the atom. The result is that there are small matrix elements for transitions between the states, accompanied by creating one photon, and these give the dipole atomic transitions. This is worked out in Sakurai's book, among others.</p>\n",
            " <p>Ron Maimon is correct that the Hamiltonian as usually written is not really the full Hamiltonian, because it does not include terms for the coupling of the atomic system to the radiation field. Maimon shows one way of doing this formally, but there is a more intuitive and understandable explanation, which also gives the same transition rate as Ron's formal method. I have posted this on other occasions and whenever I have done so, Ron has ridiculed my analysis. Nevertheless, at the risk of further ridicule, I will post it again.</p>\n\n<p>The simplest case to consider is the 2p=>1s transition of the hydrogen atom. If the 2p state is just the tiniest bit perturbed, so that there is just a little bit of ground state mixed in, the combination is unstable. It is unstable because you can easily verify that the superposition of s and p states has an oscillating dipole moment, and this must radiate according to Maxwell's equations. No more and no less than Maxwell's equations are needed to give the correct transition rates between states, and there is no need to quantize the radiation field. </p>\n\n<p>How does this relate to the apparent fact that in the solution of the differential equation, the coefficients of the various eigenstates are time-invariant? This is again because the equation is only an approximation, neglecting as it does the coupling of the atom to the radiation field. Since the total energy of the radiation field is readily calculated from antenna theory, and the sum of the squares of the coefficients of the eigenstates must be unity, it is easy to solve for the value of those coefficients as a function of time. In effect, the excited atom smoothly decays to the ground state: as it does, it oscillates like a tiny antenna, emitting electromagnetic waves. There is no need to talk about photons and quantization.</p>\n\n<p>Oddly enough, you can also analyze the system in terms of pure eigenstates and quantum leaps, the way Ron does, and you actually get correct answers that way.

        "sft_target": " <p>The true eigenstates, when they exist, don't decay. They sit and spin around in phase forever. But atomic eigenstates are not true eigenstates. The reason atomic states decay is because they are coupled to photon states, and the combined photon-atom Hamiltonian doesn't have excited atom eigenstates.</p>\n\n<p>When you have an atom in a box of mirrors, there are true eigenstates of the combined photon-atom system inside the box. These are states where a quantum of energy is absorbed by the atom, remitted into the box, in a steady way, so that it is sometimes in the atom, sometimes in the photons of the box. But when you make the box big, the energy will be in the photons nearly all the time, and the atom will be in its ground state, just because there are infinitely many more photon states than atomic states. In the limit of no box, the excited atomic states are never true eigenstates, they always decay into photons irreversibly. This process was described by Fermi, and the rate of irreversible decay is given by Fermi's golden rule.</p>\n\n<p>For atoms and radiation, the coupling is mostly by a term in the Hamiltonian equal to $p\\cdot A(x)$, where p is the momentum of the electron and A is the vector potential at the position of the electron, plus a direct two-photon term $A(x)^2$ which you can usually ignore. You evaluate the transition by expanding A in plane waves, the coefficients of which are photon creation operators, and approximating the exponential of the X operator by the first two terms of a Taylor expansion. This is called the dipole approximation.</p>\n\n<p>The resulting Hamiltonian describes transitions between the pure atom stationary states into states of the atom plus a photon, and for long times, the transitions conserve energy, so that the outgoing photon carries the energy difference that is lost by the decay. The dipole approximation is essentially exact for transitions which are dipole-allowed because the atomic motion is nonrelativistic, so that the wavelength of the light is enormous compared to the atom. The result is that there are small matrix elements for transitions between the states, accompanied by creating one photon, and these give the dipole atomic transitions. This is worked out in Sakurai's book, among others.</p>\n",
        "rejected_target": " <p>Ron Maimon is correct that the Hamiltonian as usually written is not really the full Hamiltonian, because it does not include terms for the coupling of the atomic system to the radiation field. Maimon shows one way of doing this formally, but there is a more intuitive and understandable explanation, which also gives the same transition rate as Ron's formal method. I have posted this on other occasions and whenever I have done so, Ron has ridiculed my analysis. Nevertheless, at the risk of further ridicule, I will post it again.</p>\n\n<p>The simplest case to consider is the 2p=>1s transition of the hydrogen atom. If the 2p state is just the tiniest bit perturbed, so that there is just a little bit of ground state mixed in, the combination is unstable. It is unstable because you can easily verify that the superposition of s and p states has an oscillating dipole moment, and this must radiate according to Maxwell's equations. No more and no less than Maxwell's equations are needed to give the correct transition rates between states, and there is no need to quantize the radiation field. </p>\n\n<p>How does this relate to the apparent fact that in the solution of the differential equation, the coefficients of the various eigenstates are time-invariant? This is again because the equation is only an approximation, neglecting as it does the coupling of the atom to the radiation field. Since the total energy of the radiation field is readily calculated from antenna theory, and the sum of the squares of the coefficients of the eigenstates must be unity, it is easy to solve for the value of those coefficients as a function of time. In effect, the excited atom smoothly decays to the ground state: as it does, it oscillates like a tiny antenna, emitting electromagnetic waves. There is no need to talk about photons and quantization.</p>\n\n<p>Oddly enough, you can also analyze the system in terms of pure eigenstates and quantum leaps, the way Ron does, and you actually get correct answers that way. But just because you get the right answer doesn't mean your physical picture has any connection with reality. </p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I am a little confused about the way commutators are derived in the radial quantization of a 2D CFT. I am trying to derive the relation <span class=\"math-container\">$$\\int_w \\mathcal{R} \\left(a(z)b(w)\\right)dz = \\left[A,b(w)\\right]$$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\">$A = \\int a(z) dz.$</span></p>\n<p>In order to clarify my question, I will follow the steps in reverse compared to what is done in the book &quot;Conformal Field Theory&quot; by Francesco and other authors.</p>\n<p>Let's say we have two operators <span class=\"math-container\">$a(z)$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$b(w)$</span>. Let us fix the point <span class=\"math-container\">$w$</span> somewhere in the plane. Define two circular contours <span class=\"math-container\">$C_1$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$C_2$</span> around the origin such that the point <span class=\"math-container\">$w$</span> sits in the annular region made by <span class=\"math-container\">$C_1$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$C_2$</span>. Now define two integrals <span class=\"math-container\">$\\int_{C_1}a(z)b(w)dz$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$\\int_{C_2}b(w)a(z)dz$</span> and subtract them (contours shown in fig 1) as <span class=\"math-container\">$$\\int_{C_1}a(z)b(w)dz - \\int_{C_2}b(w)a(z)dz.$$</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bjURn.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bjURn.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Then morph the loops from fig 1 into those of fig 2 by moving the red and blue loops close to each other without changing the order of the operators (in order to maintain radial ordering). Finally, I break the integrals of fig 2 into two pieces, one piece is shown in fig 3 and the other one is in fig 4.</p>\n<p>My question is this: Why do we neglect the integral corresponding to fig 4? In the limiting case where the blue arc <span class=\"math-container\">$C_4$</span> and the red arc <span class=\"math-container\">$C_5$</span> come very close, the integral corresponding to figure 4 should be <span class=\"math-container\">$$\\int_{C_5 \\to C_4} [a(z),b(w)]dz.$$</span> Isn't the integral of fig 4 the major contributor to the commutator <span class=\"math-container\">$\\left[A,b(w)\\right]$</span>? If so, wouldn't the contribution of integral in fig 3 go to zero in the limit where <span class=\"math-container\">$C_3$</span> shrinks to point <span class=\"math-container\">$w$</span> because then fig 4 will become the entire commutator?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

In every solid, the constituent atom/ions are held by primary bonds (covalent/ ionic/ metallic). When we apply stress, we deform the atom/ions from its lattice. If the material can accept the deformation by getting strained- we call it ductile.Ductile materials must have some mechanism to absorb the stress- forming defects in its lattice. Brittle materials can't create defect in its lattice to absorb stress, so it deforms upto certain stress then break suddenly. </p>\n\n<p>Source  <a href=\"https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/why-is-fcc-more-ductile-than-bcc.550403/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/why-is-fcc-more-ductile-than-bcc.550403/</a></p>\n\n<p>Crystalline structure is important because it contributes to the properties of a material. For example, it is easier for planes of atoms to slide by each other if those planes are closely packed. Therefore, lattice structures with closely packed planes allow more plastic deformation than those that are not closely packed. Additionally, cubic lattice structures allow slippage to occur more easily than non-cubic lattices. This is because their symmetry provides closely packed planes in several directions. A face-centered cubic crystal structure will exhibit more ductility (deform more readily under load before breaking) than a body-centered cubic structure. The bcc lattice, although cubic, is not closely packed and forms strong metals. Alpha-iron and tungsten have the bcc form. The fcc lattice is both cubic and closely packed and forms more ductile materials. Gamma-iron, silver, gold, and lead have fcc structures. Finally, HCP lattices are closely packed, but not cubic. HCP metals like cobalt and zinc are not as ductile as the fcc metals.</p>\n",

            " <p>I think it's worth describing a couple examples where the original poster's logic <em>does</em> apply. Then I'll answer the question by (a) distinguishing those earlier scenarios from the photoelectric effect, (b) explaining why that earlier logic doesn't apply to the photoelectric current, and (c) deriving the equation for photoelectric current.</p>\n\n<p>There are many contexts where increasing the speed $v$ causes the current $I$ to increase. As a first example, imagine that there are $n$ charge carriers per cubic meter traveling through a wire of cross-sectional area $A$. The charge of the charge carriers is $q$, and their drift speed is $v$. The current is given by $I = nAqv$, and thus the current $I$ is directly proportional to speed $v$ as long as $n$, $A$, and $q$ are constant. As a second example, if you send a proton around a particle accelerator $5,000$ times per second, the current is $I=(5000/\\textrm{sec})(1.6\\times10^{-19}\\textrm{C})\\approx8 \\textrm{ atto amperes}$. But if you send the proton around a particle accelerator $10,000$ times per second, the current is twice as big, $I\\approx16 \\textrm{ atto amperes}$.</p>\n\n<p>Here's why that drift speed equation and that logic don't apply to the photoelectric current: the photoelectrons are halted every time they completely one lap. Consider an electron that is ejected with high $KE$ from the metal plate, then moves around the circuit <em>really</em> fast, and finally returns back to the metal plate in a very short time. That electron won't be ejected again until another photon strikes it. So the photon density regulates the current, and electrons are ejected only as frequently as the photons arrive at the metal plate. If, somehow, the electrons were able to continue whizzing around the circuit as fast as they were originally ejected (without ever slowing down or being stopped), then higher speeds $v$ <em>would</em> produce higher currents. However, <strong>the ejected photoelectrons do not move with constant speed around the circuit, and thus the high initial ejection speed does not indicate how many laps the electrons make per second.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the reason we can't look at the equation $I=nAqv$ and say \"high speed $v$ implies high current $I$\" is that the values in this equation are not constant.

The faster the electrons are moving, the more distance each one covers before the next is ejected, which means that\u00a0the electrons are more spread out, i.e., the density is lower.

By Faraday's law, <strong>the sum of the voltages across all the lumps must be zero</strong>.</p>\n<p>Depending on how it is interpreted, that answers your question.  However, we can say a bit more...</p>\n<p>The battery voltage is fixed (9 volts), so the sum of the voltages across the other lumps must be -9 volts.  Those other lumps are the two resistors and the bulb (we treat the bulb as just another resistor) so the 9 volts must be divided up between the resistors.</p>\n<h1>A longer answer:</h1>\n<p>Faraday's law, which is one of Maxwell's four fundamental equations of electromagnetism, states that the integral of the electric field around a circuit must be equal to the change in magnetic flux through the circuit.</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$\\oint{\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Phi_B}}{\\mathrm{d}t}$</span></p>\n<p>This result was arrived at by experimental observation but is essentially consistent with later theory (e.g. quantum electrodynamics).</p>\n<p>In a circuit with a battery, resistors, and a bulb, in which the current has been running more than a few seconds, there is negligible change in magnetic flux and so the integral of the electric field around the circuit roughly zero:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$\\oint{\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell} \\approx 0$</span></p>\n<p>The integral of the electric field between two points <span class=\"math-container\">$a$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$b$</span> is <span class=\"math-container\">$V_{a,b}=-\\int^b_a\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell$</span> (there are other expressions but this is common and arises from the work required to move an electric charge in the field). You know this better as the <em>voltage</em> between points <span class=\"math-container\">$a$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$b$</span>.</p>\n<p>We chop up the circuit into lumps -- a resistor from point <span class=\"math-container\">$a$</span> to point <span class=\"math-container\">$b$</span>, another resistor from <span class=\"math-container\">$c$</span> to <span class=\"math-container\">$d$</span>, a bulb from <span class=\"math-container\">$e$</span> to <span class=\"math-container\">$f$</span>, a battery from <span class=\"math-container\">$g$</span> to <span class=\"math-container\">$h$</span>, wires.</p>\n<p>We measure the voltage across each lump -- <span class=\"math-container\">$V_{a,b}$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\">$V_{c,d}$</span>, and so on -- and add the voltages up:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$V_{a,b}+V_{c,d}+V{e,f}+V{g,h} = \\int^a_b\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell +\n \\int^c_d\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell+ \\int^e_f\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell+ \\int^g_h\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell$</span>.</p>\n<p>But the sum of all the electric field integrals for each lump are equal to the\nelectric field integral around the whole loop</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$\\int^a_b\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell +\n \\int^c_d\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell+ \\int^e_f\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell+ \\int^g_h\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell =  \\oint\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell =0$</span></p>\n<p>because the loop is made up of the lumps</p>\n<p>We assume the battery voltage is fixed at 9 volts.  (In truth it is slowly declining but over the time that we are measuring it's not going to be noticeable).  So the voltages across the other components have to add up to -9 volts.</p>\n<p>We also assume that the voltage in the wires is zero.  This is not completely accurate but the voltage drop across a copper wire in a circuit like the one in your example will be fairly tiny.</p>\n<p>All we have left now are the resistors and the bulb.  The bulb acts more or less like a resistor too, once the circuit has been running for a while.

            " <p>Dear Nigel, if you measure the particle's position and find it in a small region, you also change its state. </p>\n\n<p>As you correctly wrote, a localized wave packet (I don't talk about a delta-function state vector whose average kinetic energy would be infinite) can be rewritten as a linear superposition of energy eigenstates.</p>\n\n<p>It means that before you measured the energy, there was a nonzero probability for the energy to be $(21/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and this particular outcome was ultimately realized. There is no violation of the energy conservation law here.</p>\n\n<p>What you may be annoyed by is that the final energy of the electron usually isn't equal to the expectation value of energy in the state before the measurement. It's surely true. But there is no reason why it should be. The expectation value isn't any \"objective value\" of energy. It's just a statistical average of many possibilities, and only some of them will be realized, as dictated by the probabilities predicted by quantum mechanics.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish, the process of measurement violates the \"conservation of the expectation value of energy\".</p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, this \"violation\" can't be used to obtain any sharp contradiction with the conservation law for the \"actual\" energy. You may only interpret the measured energy in a \"classical way\" after decoherence, which means after the measuring apparatus has interacted with the environmental degrees of freedom (that are needed for decoherence). If you prepare your harmonic oscillator plus the apparatus in a state whose total energy is sufficiently sharply well-defined to reveal the \"violation of the conservation law for the expectation value\", the environmental degrees of freedom will inevitably spoil this accuracy.</p>\n",
            " <p>A QM wave function describes an ensemble of measurements, not the single measurement output. The corresponding potential does not describe the perturbation due to measurement. If you only measure the system energy, it will be $E_0$, of course, because you measure the eigenstate of the corresponding operator. </p>\n\n<p>But the coordinate operator does not commute with the Hamiltonian, the ground state is not its eigenstate so you will get dispersion in coordinate measurements. While measuring coordinate you may introduce a perturbation that changes the initial state. Now you may have a superposition of eigenstates of Hamiltonian. No wonder you may then find energies different from the ground state.</p>\n",
            " <p>What is interesting about this question is that the answers may display its author's Interpretation of QM. Let us first review the order of events here:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Particle is prepared in Ground State $\\psi_0$ (an Energy Eigenstate)</li>\n<li>Particle is position measured with observable X (measurement-1)</li>\n<li>Particle is now in a Position Eigenstate</li>\n<li>Particle is now Energy measured (measurement-2)</li>\n<li>Particle is in state $\\psi_{21/2}$</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In this example energy has been given to the particle.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly this is similar to an atom's electron becoming excited. If this has happened via a collision or photon absorption during either measurement, then the particle will only absorb an integral quantums worth of energy.</p>\n\n<p>However since the Hamiltonian in this case is $H=1/2(p^2 + x^2)$, then $[X,H]=\\hbar p\\neq0$.\nSo the quantum formalist can simply take the Copenhagen view that since the observables dont commute no guarantees can be given about their eigenvalues staying the same after such measurement history. And no further explanation as to \"why\" need be given beyond \"quantum fluctuation\" (or \"quantum randomness\" if you prefer). Thus there is no \"microtheory\" explaining where the energy (in this case - maybe extra momentum in another case) came from.</p>\n\n<p>Further considerations: (1) if one entertains a \"hidden variable\" philosophy then this experiment needs to be explained by that means. (2) This experiment has similarities to the quantum vacuum explanations for spontaneous emission. If such a model could apply here then we could say that the particle has had a random payoff from the quantum vacuum, perhaps mediated by one of the measurements.</p>\n\n<p>Also any entanglement between measurement instrument and particle is supposed to have ended shortly after measurement as a result of decoherence between a classical object and a quantum one.</p>\n",
            " <p>For a high degree of accuracy you would have to probe the particle with a high energy (short wavelength) photon so there is plenty of energy that can go into vibrational excitation. After such hard hit the particle will be smeared across a wide range of states $$\\Psi=a_0*\\Psi_0+a_1*\\Psi_1+...$$This is not an entanglement but a simple superposition of eigenstates. The expectation value of the particle's energy $\\bar{E}=\\sum_{i}a_i^2E_i$ should not be equal to the energy of any particular state and the second measurement will yield $E_i$ with $a_i^2$ probability.</p>\n\n<p>So, the extra energy comes from an interaction with a probe particle and it doesn't have to be precisely equal to the energy of a certain vibrational state.</p>\n",
            " <p>Thinking about your question has led me to the following conclusion:</p>\n\n<p>Suppose there is a a conserved quantity $Y$, and an isolated system $S$. Let's also suppose the isolation is temporarily lifted to measure an observable $\\widehat{X}$ of $S$. This measurement is performed by a measuring apparatus $A$. For simplicity, let's lump together the rest of the universe outside the system including the apparatus and the environment into $A$. Let's further assume we have a tensor product structure between $S$ and $A$ for the Hilbert space. Let $\\widehat{Y}_S$ and $\\widehat{Y}_A$ be the restriction of $\\widehat{Y}$ to $S$ and $A$ respectively.  Then, the sum $\\widehat{Y}_S + \\widehat{Y}_A$ has to be conserved.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's suppose $\\widehat{Y}_S$ and $\\widehat{X}$ don't commute. Let's see what happens if we further make an assumption very common in measurement theory that for systems starting out in an eigenstate of $X$, a perfect measurement will leave it in an eigenstate of $X$ with the same eigenvalue. The Hilbert space of $A$ decomposes into eigenspaces of a pointer operator $\\widehat{P}$ such that after a measurement of an eigenstate of $X$, $A$ ends up in an eigenstate of $\\widehat{P}$ with an eigenvalue equal to the eigenvalue of $X$.</p>\n\n<p>As $\\widehat{Y}_S$ and $\\widehat{X}$ don't commute, there exists an eigenvalue of $X$ such that all nonzero eigenstates of it aren't also $\\widehat{Y}_S$ eigenstates. With all these assumptions in place, an initial state of $\\sum_n c_n \\left| x_n \\right\\rangle$ will evolve into\n$$\\sum_n c_n \\left| x_n \\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left| \\chi_n \\right\\rangle$$\nwhere $\\left| \\chi_m \\right\\rangle$ and $\\left| \\chi_n \\right\\rangle$ are orthogonal if $m \\neq n$ because they have different pointer values. Let's further assume $A$ is initially in an eigenstate of $\\widehat{Y}_A$. Assume that the system is initially in an eigenstate of $\\widehat{Y}_S$ with eigenvalue $y_m$ which isn't also an eigenstate of $X$. Then, this state can be expressed as $\\sum_n U_{mn} \\left| x_n \\right\\rangle$ with $U_{mn}$ being nonzero for at least two different values of $n$. The final state is\n$$\\sum_{np} U_{mn} U_{pn}^* \\left| y_p \\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left| \\chi_n \\right\\rangle$$\nIf we look at the contribution to the sum for one of the values of $n$ for which $U_{mn}$ is nonzero, we find the combined $S+A$ system can't be in an eigenstate of $\\widehat{Y}$. Precisely because the $\\chi$'s are orthogonal, the contributions from different $n$'s can't cancel, and this remains true for the wavefunction as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>But of course, $\\widehat{Y}$ generates a symmetry, and $\\widehat{X}$ is not invariant under this symmetry. So, to measure $X$, the initial state of the apparatus can't possibly be invariant under this symmetry either. So, we shouldn't expect $A$ to start in an eigenstate of $\\widehat{Y}_A$. The measurement process itself is expected to change $\\widehat{Y}_S$, but we have a compensating change in $\\widehat{Y}_A$.</p>\n",
            " <p>If I understand correctly, the key question in the topmost post is in this sentence \"measurement-1 which probed the position of the particle can\u2019t have delivered to it a precise amount of energy\".</p>\n\n<p>Now, what I am thinking is that, if you really measure the position of a system (or a component of a system), then measure the energy of this system again, will you really get a discrete spectrum of energies (in the case of a simple harmonic oscillator)?</p>\n\n<p>I guess not, because measuring the position can perturb the overall momentum of the system, thus changing the translational energy, which has a continuous spectrum.</p>\n\n<p>So in the case of harmonic oscillator, after measuring its position, the wave function will not be a superposition of the discrete eigenfunctions, but rather an integral of a continua of eigenfunctions, which include the cases with nonzero translational energies.</p>\n\n<p>But I believe the point here is not really about \"position measurement\".  I mean, maybe position measurement is just a bad example.  One could devise other types of measurements to collapse an energy-eigenstate into a superpositional one (of discrete energy levels).  If the measurement is designed careful enough, I believe the process by which a discrete amount of energy is transferred to or from the system being measured will become very clear.</p>\n",
            " <p>I read the original question and all six answers above. I do not think that these answers directly answer the question. There is energy transferring from the apparatus to the particle, amounting to an uncontrollable disturbance of the momentum, indicated also by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in the context of the measuring position of an electron using a light beam focusing on it. The original question is, how the energy transformation is made during the measurement? Or, how the energy flows from the apparatus to the particle? Or, is there any dynamical mechanism? As far as I know, there is NO answer within the current formalism of quantum mechanics. </p>\n"

            " <p><a href=\"http://www.delsol.com/about/color-change\">There is an explanation on the Del Sol web site</a> but it omits the technical details. This is probably because Del Sol regard it as commercially valuable confidential intellectual property, and I have to concede that they are probably correct.</p>\n\n<p>Anyhow, some Googling has turned up a suggestion for how it works but there is no proof for this idea so treat it as just a hypothesis until such time as Del Sol reveal their technology.</p>\n\n<p>The hypothesis is that colours are due to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence\">fluorescence</a>. The dyes use absorb light and re-emit it at a different wavelength giving the colours we see on the clothes. The colour change happens because the dyes can exist in two states, one of which fluoresces at uv wavelengths and the other at visible wavelengths. The change between the two states is triggered by ultra-violet light.</p>\n\n<p>Artificial light contains very little ultraviolet so the dyes revert to the state in which they do not fluoresce in the visible wavelengths. Sunlight contains significant uv and in sunlight the dyes change to the form that fluoresces at visible wavelengths. That's why the colour appears only in sunlight.</p>\n",
            " <p>To discriminate between the other two answers.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-resolved_spectroscopy#Time-resolved_fluorescence_spectroscopy\">Lifetime spectroscopy</a> would be capable of distinguishing between <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photochromic\">photochromism</a> (in this case, reversible ultraviolet-switchable reflectance, example: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexaarylbiimidazole\">hexaarylbiimidazole</a> where the transition time is milliseconds to seconds) and ultraviolet fluorescence (where the \"transition time\" is zero, although the excited fluorscent state probably has a lifetime of nanoseconds or shorter).</p>\n\n<p>One way to implement this is with a small black light and a large high speed box fan.  The fan acts as an optical chopper.  Shining the light through the blades of the fan at the shirt, if the effect is fluorescence, the color will immediately appear every time the shirt is illuminated.  If the effect is photochromism, the color will appear if the fan is set to a slow enough rotation speed (perhaps stopped, if the transition time is \"long\").</p>\n",
            " <p>I believe the dyes behave similar to glow in the dark materials; They fluoresce a certain wavelength over time after being radiated.<br>\nIn the case of these shirts you'll have different chemicals for different colours, but which are all \"activated\" by UV radiation.</p>\n\n<p>There is a pretty nice <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorescence\" rel=\"nofollow\">explanation on Wikipedia</a>, but basically this:  </p>\n\n<p>You can excite an electron by providing it with a high enough packet of energy - i.e UV rays for example.  This means that the electron has more energy, and moves to a higher energy state (often thought of as a higher orbital).  What usually happens is that that electron drops down to its usual energy state pretty much immediately, which gives off light (a vibrating electron generates photons).  A nice example of this are those camping gas-lights: put in heat, electron excites and de-excites immediately, but constantly, giving you a nice constant bright light)</p>\n\n<p>However, for phosphorescence, the electron only drops down some time later, which means that if you put in energy now, it gives off light until later, albeit not so bright.</p>\n",

(this is just a simple statement of <em>Kirchoff's Current Law</em>)</p>\n\n<p>Now, Ohm's Law tells us what's the voltage across a resistor, depending on its current:</p>\n\n<p>$$V=IR$$</p>\n\n<p>For the first resistor we'd have,</p>\n\n<p>$$V(R_1)=I(R_1)\\times{}R_1$$</p>\n\n<p>and for the second resistor,</p>\n\n<p>$$V(R_2)=I(R_2)\\times{}R_2$$.</p>\n\n<p>But, in your problem, the values of R1 and R2 are equal, R1 = R2. Let's just call that value <em>R</em>.</p>\n\n<p>And since the current through the two resistors is equal, we'll just call that current <em>I</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Now, we get $V(R_1)=V(R_2)=I\\times{}R$, which we can just call $V(R)$.  </p>\n\n<p>This already shows that the voltage is \"evenly split\" between the two resistors. Since the voltage across the two resistors is equal, the voltage at \"B\" must be exactly half-way between the voltages at \"C\" and \"A\".</p>\n\n<p>Note: We didn't even have to mention the battery or its voltage to get this result. Simply because the two resistors are equal, and there's nowhere for current to go at node \"B\", we know that the voltage between A and C is split equally between the two resistors.</p>\n"

If it only accesses Android automatic updates and other legitimate websites in its idle time, then it's probably not infected.

When sending them directly (as arguments) to a script, I can hard restrict the characters used in the arguments with sudo (<code>user ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /bin/program [0-9][0-9a-z][0-9a-z]...</code>) so that an attacker cannot use special character combinations to bypass the restriction and thus gain root access.</p>\n<p>When getting data through the pipe (stdin), I will also of course filter data:</p>\n<pre><code>#!/bin/sh\npass=$(dd if=/dev/stdin bs=1 count=10 2&gt;/dev/null | tr -cd [:alnum:])\n</code></pre>\n<p>, but I consider simple rules of restriction of arguments through sudo safer (also in the script itself there will be additional checking).</p>\n<p>So is there a fundamental difference between passing through stdin or arguments?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>I think the title to your question and the body of your question are contradicting each other a bit and I think that may be leading to some of the confusion with the other correct answers.</p>\n<p>Your title says &quot;Is it really safe&quot; but in the body of your request you're comparing passing data via stdin vs command line arguments. When you compare two things the result of the comparison only speaks to the comparison and never allows you to make an absolute claim outside of the comparison itself. For example: The number 10 is more than the number 5. So 10 is &quot;bigger&quot; than 5. But is 10 a &quot;big&quot; number when there are obviously much bigger numbers? I can't justify saying &quot;10 is a big number&quot; just because it's bigger than some other number.</p>\n<p>So: &quot;is it safe?&quot; is one question, but your question is really implying: &quot;Is it safer?&quot; with an emphasis on the extra &quot;r&quot; on &quot;safer&quot;.</p>\n<p>Just like it doesn't make sense to say that 10 is a big number when there are always bigger numbers: Nothing in information security is ever 100% &quot;safe&quot;. As you point out there are attack vectors that could allow an attacker to get at data passed via stdin. The point is that there are FAR fewer attack vectors that allow an attacker to get access to data passed via stdin. AND those vectors are more difficult to achieve.</p>\n<p>As the other answers point out: Data passed via command line arguments are visible for a long time. They are very often logged into log files as well as history files like .bash_history. These log files and history files can get backed up to the cloud, copied to other folders, disks, etc. This data is also visible to other system accounts which could potentially be compromised. In other words: An attacker has a lot of available attack vectors to gain access to command line argument data. And because of how long this data remains around for viewing, the attacker also has a larger window of time for which he can utilize to execute these attacks and still access the command line data.</p>\n<p>With stdin there are not only fewer vectors: But the attacker also has a limited time window to execute a successful attack here. He has to compromise your account specifically, or root. Both of which are more difficult than compromising one of the system accounts.  Then assuming he pulls off a successful attack to compromise your account or root: Now he can only see data being passed to stdin in real time. He can't go back and look in bash_history or log files to see data from stdin.</p>\n<p>Between the lower number of attack vectors and the timing issue: It's obvious that passing data via stdin is SAFER. And that's what matters: It's not possible for something to be 100% foolproof/safe. Everything in security is about choosing the safest possible option which minimizes the number of attack vectors or exposed &quot;surface area&quot; of points that can potentially be attacked and lead to a system becoming compromised.</p>\n<p>So: TL;DR: No, stdin is not 100% safe as nothing is. But it's far SAFER than command line arguments which is why it's preferred over using command line arguments to pass sensitive data like passwords.</p>\n",

            " <p>I think one of the main reason people advise to move away from Filezilla is clearly the fact passwords are stored as plain text and thus, easilly stolen.\nFilezilla bad reputation began some years ago when some malwares began to target specifically Filezilla. \nUsing critical flaws in third party softwares (namely flash and acrobat reader) these malwares were able to steal the XML passowrd file Filezilla uses to store the passwords.\nMost of the time, these malwares were eradicated and cleaned in a few seconds, but the data was stolen.\nThese stolen credential files were then handled in a very complicated bot zombie network which connected to each and every ftp contained in the file, scanned it then propagated malware in every index.html/php file found on these FTP. In less than 2 hours, all the ftp websites stored in filezilla were infected.\nAt the time, the process has been very well documented by some victim webmasters.</p>\n\n<p>Probably thousands of webmasters, tens of thousands of websites, were infected because of this. Many many complained about the fact the passwords were not encrypted.</p>\n\n<p>The second reason people advise to move away from Filezilla is the reaction of the developper team : instead of adding this feature, they just refused every argument, either sending back the responsibility to badly secured systems or pretending that encrypting passwords would not change anything, that it was system's responsibility to secure data.</p>\n\n<p>So for now, if you still want to use Filezilla (which is a good ftp client) you really should consider disabling all password storing options and using a third party tool like Keepass. It's a bit of a pain in the <em>*</em> but it's safer. \nYou may even find bonus advantages with Keepass because you'll have a tool to centralize cross-protocol credentials in a safer way</p>\n",

It was also my first experience of malware with Macs.</p>\n\n<p>I will never use FileZilla again. Even if you can \"opt-out\" this is clearly designed to fool the users and worst of all the developer is just copy pasting a dishonest reply on FileZilla's forums.

        "responses": [
            " <p>Cryptographic oracles are a black box input/output method.</p>\n\n<p>It will respond to any input with a pseudo-random response but will always give the same output for a specific input.</p>\n\n<p>They're generally used for hash functions where randomness is important for higher security.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously there are still going to be security issues as it is just a mathematical function that is returning seemingly pseudo-random numbers, but they are obviously stronger than some of their less random counterparts.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a solid paper about them and their design - <a href=\"http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/users/mihir/papers/ro.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/users/mihir/papers/ro.pdf</a></p>\n",
            " <p>An <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle\" rel=\"noreferrer\">oracle</a> is an individual who knows the personal cell phone number of a god. This enables him (or her) to obtain some information which is usually considered as out of reach of mere mortals, such as glimpses of the future. In cryptography, that's the same, except that no deity is involved: an oracle is any system which can give some extra information on a system, which otherwise would not be available.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider asymmetric encryption with <a href=\"http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2125\" rel=\"noreferrer\">RSA</a>. The standard I link to states how a piece of data should be encrypted with a public key. In particular, the encryption begins with a <em>padding</em> operation, in which the piece of data is first expanded by adding a header, so that the padded data length matches the RSA public key length. The header should begin with the two bytes <code>0x00 0x02</code>, followed by at least eight random non-zero bytes, and then another <code>0x00</code>. Once the data has been padded, it is time to apply the mathematical operation which is at the core of the RSA operation (modular exponentiation). Details of the padding are important for security.</p>\n<p>The encryption result is an integer modulo the <em>RSA modulus</em>, a big integer which is part of the public key. For a 1024-bit RSA key, the modulus <em>n</em> is an integer value greater than <em>2<sup>1023</sup></em>, but smaller than <em>2<sup>1024</sup></em>. A properly encrypted data chunk, with RSA, yields an integer value between <em>1</em> and <em>n-1</em>. However, the padding implies some <em>structure</em>, as shown above. The decrypting party MUST find, upon decryption, a properly formed PKCS#1 header, beginning with the <code>0x00 0x02</code> bytes, followed by at least eight non-zero bytes, and there must be a <code>0x00</code> which marks the end of the header. Therefore, not all integers between <em>1</em> and <em>n-1</em> are valid RSA-encrypted message (less than 1 every 65000 such integers would yield a proper padding upon decryption).</p>\n<p><em>Knowing</em> whether a given integer modulo <em>n</em> would yield, upon decryption, a valid padding structure, is supposed to be infeasible for whoever does not know the private key. The private key owner (the deity) obtains that information, and much more: if the decryption works, the private key owner actually gets the message, which is the point of decryption. Assume that there <em>is</em> an entity, somewhere, who can tell you whether a given integer modulo <em>n</em> is a validly encrypted piece of data with RSA; that entity would not give you the full decryption result, it would just tell you whether decryption would work or not. That's a one-bit information, a reduced glimpse of what the deity would obtain. The entity is your oracle: it returns <em>parts</em> of the information what is normally available only to the private key owner.</p>\n<p>It <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.19.8543\" rel=\"noreferrer\">turns out</a> that, given access to such an oracle, it is possible to rebuild the private key, by sending specially crafted integers modulo <em>n</em> (it takes a million or so of such values, and quite a bit of mathematics, but it can be done). It also turns out that most <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2246\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SSL/TLS</a> implementation of that time (that was in 1999) were involuntarily acting as oracles: if you sent, as a client, an invalidly RSA-encrypted ClientKeyExchange message, the server was responding with a specific error message (&quot;duh, your ClientKeyExchange message stinks&quot;), whereas if decryption worked, the server was keeping on with the protocol, using whatever value it decrypted (usually unknown to the client if the client sent a random value, so the protocol failed later on, but the client could see the difference between a valid and an invalid padding). Therefore, with such an implementation, an attacker could (after a million or so of failed connections) rebuild the server private key, which is usually considered to be a bad thing.</p>\n<p>That's what oracles are: a mathematical description of a data leak, to be used in security proofs. In the case of RSA, this demonstrates that knowing whether a value has a proper padding or not is somehow equivalent to learning the private key (if you know the private key you can attempt the decryption and see the padding for yourself; the Bleichenbacher attack shows that it also works the other way round).</p>\n",
            " <p>An oracle is something which can immediately (<code>O(1)</code>) give you the answer to some problem, usually an infeasible or impossible problem.  For example, a <em>\"Halting-problem Oracle\"</em> could tell you immediately whether a certain program on a certain input halts or not, even though the halting problem is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">uncomputable</a> to us mere mortals.  However, we can sometimes prove some useful properties by pretending certain oracles exist.</p>\n\n<p>In cryptographic papers, for instance, oracles are most often used to show that, even <strong>if</strong> our attackers had access to some seemingly-impossibile oracle, they <em>still</em> wouldn't have any (significant) advantage to breaking our security.  For example, one important property of encryption algorithms <em>(called resistance to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-plaintext_attack\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">known plaintext attacks</a>)</em> is that if an attacker is given a message encrypted with your key <code>m'</code> and they want to know the original message <code>m</code> <em>(or figure out your key)</em>, then giving them another message <code>n</code> and its encryption with your key <code>n'</code> should not help them do so in any way whatsoever.</p>\n\n<p>Taking this to the extreme <em>(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen-plaintext_attack\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chosen plaintext attack</a>)</em>: give an attacker an oracle who can encrypt or decrypt <em>any</em> message with your key <strong>except</strong> for <code>m</code> and <code>m'</code>.  Even under these extreme conditions, we'd want to show for our encryption that the attacker with the oracle will have no advantage in finding <code>m</code> <em>(or your key)</em> than the attacker without the oracle.  This would mean our encryption is safe from chosen-plaintext attacks.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>[Edit]</strong><br>\nHere is another practical example.  In the question <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/8318719/238419\">Could a program ever tell if another program plays chess</a>, we show that no such program exists by first assuming that there <em>is</em> a chess-detection oracle, then showing its existence leads to a logical impossibility.</p>\n",

Each password should have at least 16 characters and must be sentence of at least 4 words to make it more secure and memorable. But this will make the attacker know that all passwords are like that. Is this a bad idea?  </p>\n\n<p>What better ways are there to force passwords that are more secure and memorable at the same time? </p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>You are not damaging the security of the passwords by telling the attacker that the password is at least 16 chars long, and comprised of 4 or more words. It's the same as telling that the password must have at least 10 chars, have at least one capitalized letter, one number and one symbol. Right?</p>\n\n<p>With 4 words, the cost of a bruteforce is bigger than 10 random chars. If you ask the user to use at least one capital letter, the cost increases even more.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Oxford dictionary, English have a little less than 175k words. There are 8.64 \u00d7 10<sup>20</sup> possible combinations. Using all 95 chars on an English keyboard, you have 5.98 \u00d7 10<sup>19</sup> possible combinations.</p>\n",
            " <p>It is not necessarily a bad idea. The attacker can know the password is in that format, considering the 4 words are random enough. But here is the thing, there are other good ways to make a memorable strong password. Limiting your users to the one you like is not very nice. For example I use password manager with truly random long passwords, which is even better than what you propose, but I could not do that on your site.</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, if the reason you want to do this is to force users to use strong password, then generate the 4 words password for them. You can generate such password by having a dictionary, then choosing random number between 1 and the number of words in your dictionary and taking that word. Do this 4 times and you have a password. You can get inspiration <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/jvdl/correcthorsebatterystaple/src\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. This is important, as most users may not choose 4 truly random words, but instead 4 easily guessable words. In such scenario, this would be worse then letting them choose any password.</p>\n",
            " <p>You are alluding to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27_principle\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kerckhoff's Principle</a>. When we design cryptographic systems, we assume that the attacker will know everything about your system except for the entropy derived parts (Keys/passwords/etc, typically) - this is because we can't guarantee that they don't know details, but must assume that they don't know our generated keys. Any password generation scheme follows this reasoning - if a password scheme is said to be secure, then you can believe that an attacker knowing which scheme you're using isn't a problem.</p>\n\n<p>The reason that it isn't a problem is due to the way that password namespaces work. If you demand that a user generate a password based off of a known diceware list, such as the EFF list, and you demand that it is at least 4 words long, then we can compute the namespace complexity. </p>\n\n<p>First, we'll figure out the namespace of a single word - In the EFF diceware list, you roll five six sided dice and pick the result that comes up. Because there are five positions with six options, we can compute 6^5, which gives us 7776 - this simply means that there are 7776 different possible words for each place.</p>\n\n<p>Now, we can compute the minimum namespace complexity of four of these words. This is simply done by taking the number of possible words and raising it to the power of the number of words in the password - 7776 ^ 4. This gives us 3656158440062976 (3.6 Quadrillion) possible different passwords of four EFF diceware words.</p>\n\n<p>Now, to guess how long this would take, we have to make some assumptions - </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>You are using a good hashing algorithm - scrypt, bcrypt, PBKDF2, etc.</p></li>\n<li><p>The attacker has consumer grade hardware. - We'll look at some benchmarks for an array of 8x 1080 TIs, which are top of the line at time of writing, but shouldn't be taken as the maximum hash rate - the NSA, etc probably has special hardware just for hashing passwords as fast as possible.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We can see from <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/epixoip/ace60d09981be09544fdd35005051505\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this benchmark</a> that in OpenCL, an attacker with 8x 1080 Ti can attack good algorithms at the following rates:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>scrypt at a rate of ~ 6.4 million hashes per second.</li>\n<li>bcrypt at a rate of 184 thousand hashes per second.</li>\n<li>PBKDF2-SHA256 at a rate of 775 thousand hashes per second.</li>\n<li>SHA1 (just for comparison, don't use this for passwords) at a rate of 101 billion hashes per second.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So for our given namespace of 3.6 quadrillion possible passwords, we can compute the following expected times to crack - please keep in mind that on average, 50% of the namespace will need to be exhausted, not 100%.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>scrpyt - 571274756.25984 seconds (~9 years)</li>\n<li>bcrypt - 19870426304.690086956521739130435 seconds (~315 years)</li>\n<li>PBKDF2 - 4717623793.6296464516129032258065 seconds (~75 years)</li>\n<li>SHA1 - 36199.588515475009900990099009901 seconds (~.2 days)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So, we can see that you need to implement a good hashing algorithm as well. </p>\n\n<p>Two things are missing from this algorithm - first, we didn't omit words shorter than 4 characters. The EFF diceware list has many words that are 3 characters long. If you increase the minimum word length, you reduce the namespace. I think the EFF list has ~500 words that are 3 characters long, but that's a guess. So, the namespace is slightly less complex.</p>\n\n<p>Second, we treated these passwords are randomly derived. Because you instead wanted sentences, we need to keep in mind that sentences aren't random. If you want the sentences to make sense, then there are attacks you can perform against them - you can use Markov chains and other fun stuff to generate likely sentences rather than plain brute forcing the password. I have no statistics on how much easier this is than brute forcing, so I'm going to go ahead and say you should assume it makes a huge difference and is much weaker.</p>\n",

            " <p><strong>Memorability.</strong> A 4-word password will definitely be easier to remember than a random password, but that doesn't mean the average user will actually remember it without writing it down or using a password manager anyway (there are just too many <em>different</em> passwords to remember nowadays). So memorability is useful and is great, but it might not be as useful as you think.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Security.</strong> A 4-word password will be more secure than the average password only if the words are chosen randomly from a sufficiently large set of words. According to <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/unmasked/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> article I've found the entropy of the password used by an average user is expected to be about 21 bits (2<sup>21</sup> = 2.1 \u00d7 <strong>10<sup>6</sup></strong>), which is worryingly low. If you choose 4 words randomly from a list of the 1000 most common English words, you would have 1000<sup>4</sup> = <strong>10<sup>12</sup></strong> possibilities, so a password that is 1 million times harder to bruteforce than the average password. </p>\n\n<p>So, generally speaking, your idea is not bad, as long as you don't let your users pick their own words, or they'll end up choosing passwords like \"pass pass pass pass\" or \"1 2 3 4\", etc. And of course, this is all speaking in general, because there are definitely specific cases where your method would actually decrease the security of the password. For example, your method would decrease the security of <strong>my</strong> password because I tend to use long random passwords by default, so if you forced me to use your method on your application I would be using a less secure password than usual. The same is probably true for communities like this one, where I hope the average password entropy is far greater than 21 bits and probably greater than your 4-word passwords.</p>\n",

Using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">diceware</a> is relatively good for the human aspect without being bad for the computer aspect, so it's an acceptable way to generate passwords.</p>\n\n<p>But if you want memorability, you cannot dictate to users how to generate passwords.  Nor can you require that they use passwords you generate for them.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few obvious things to avoid, like restricting password lengths to something unreasonably short, requiring characters from a particular list (like digits or punctuation), or prohibiting characters from a particular list (like spaces or quotes).  So how can you avoid those but still require secure passwords?</p>\n\n<p>You need to estimate a lower bound on entropy of the entered password, and set your policy to only accept passwords with an estimate above some minimum (possibly based on the desired minimum crack time).  The only such estimation tool I know of is <a href=\"https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">zxcvbn</a> (which unfortunately doesn't reject \"correct horse battery staple\").</p>\n\n<p>This will allow the use of relatively short randomly generated passwords and of relatively long diceware passwords, without requiring either, or allowing either to be inadequate.  The user can choose the method best for them, and you can require the level of crack-resistance you need.</p>\n\n<p>Generating and recommending diceware passwords might be helpful, and I think it's a good idea, but I would have to make sure that process didn't introduce new vulnerabilities before I would use it myself.  (Another thing to provide links about, if you do it.)</p>\n\n<p>(I'd also be inclined to have a password security chaos monkey constantly try to crack your users passwords, and force a reset whenever it succeeds.

Some (uneducated) always use same password. They hardly remembered it and do not want to be bothered by a new one so they will not use your web app if they can. Other will say: that is a nice idea, but I will not be able to remember that for a long time... let's write it down on that sheet! Those that are used to a good password manager will say <em>how stupid it is that I cannot use my random generator!</em> and again will avoid the app if they can.</p>\n\n<p>The only use case where I can accept password rules is for the main password in a corporate environment. Employees are supposed to use it everyday (every working day...) and only one is normally needed, thanks to Single Sign On solutions, so remembering it should not be a problem. For all other use cases, the end user is assumed to be responsable for his/her own data and my opinion is that anything above a minimal length is an <em>annoying</em> constraint, and I will try hard not to use that site.</p>\n",
            " <p>Don't, but do give the user that is trying to set a thoroughly insecure password a warning and make them confirm they really want to set it.</p>\n\n<p>Forcing people to set a password that is above what they can memorize will not only have them write it down, but write it down haphazardly and in an insecure place.</p>\n\n<p>Also, in some organizations, the ability to use a secure (by complexity) but shared (among an authorized team) and/or predocumented (under lock and key) passphrase is desirable - password guidelines that reject some reasonably secure passwords can become a real annoyance here. Usage scenario: \"Please set the complex passphrase this team uses for all vendors of type XYZ, so that there will be no hassle in case another member of this team needs to urgently access it in your absence\".</p>\n"

            " <p>There are two parts to your concern about password length, the threat model and the rationale behind longer passwords.  As you state,  a lot of websites have protections against common attacks, and if the password database hasn't been leaked, your password isn't easily guessable, and online protections against brute-force protections are in place, longer passwords don't make much of a difference.  When those assumptions fail, long passwords can make sure your password is too expensive to crack, as demonstrated in research.  The more general case of this question, \"Why have strong passwords at all?\", is covered in <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/52031/why-does-password-strength-matter/52039\">this question.</a></p>\n\n<h2>Threat Model</h2>\n\n<p>The threat most password policies are concerned with is an attacker trying to crack the hash of the password which has been stolen or leaked from the system, also known as an offline attack.  This usually has some of the strictest requirements. However, these offline attacks aren't the only threat model.  You password could be compromised in other ways, like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Brute-force on the website itself, as you mentioned:  Most secure websites have protections against this, which are further discussed below. Long passwords do help you from online brute-force attacks, although the cost/attempt is much higher than an offline password cracker.  These kind of attacks are somewhat common.</li>\n<li>You reused a password and the password was compromised elsewhere:  The only prevention here is to not reuse passwords. Password length won't help here and too stringent of password requirements might even discourage users from setting a different password for each site.</li>\n<li>A friend, colleague, or social engineer is trying to guess your password based on their knowledge of you: While password length helps here, you don't need very long passwords to stop this attack, and often services are rate limited to only a few attempts per hour per computer.</li>\n<li>There are also methods like phishing, exploiting the password reset, and stealing a plaintext database. In all of those threats it doesn't matter how complicated your password is; it's gone anyways.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Focusing just on online attacks and limiting log-in attempts is bad practice because password database leaks do happen.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkj3n7/myspace-data-breach-427-million-passwords-available-online\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MySpace</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/07/adobe-password-leak-can-check\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Adobe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/31/dropbox-hack-passwords-68m-data-breach\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dropbox</a>, and others have all had password hashes stolen. You can check if you appear on any public leaks <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Don't Websites Block Online Brute-Force Attempts?</h2>\n\n<p>A major part of your question appears to be why password requirements are such a big deal if protections against brute-force attacks are in place.  PCI compliance, for example, requires account lock-out for at least 30 minutes after 6 failed attempts. The biggest problem in preventing these attacks is working against botnets with thousands of computers without causing a denial of service.  How do you prevent thousands of computers each trying to log in a few times without also locking out the user when they mistype their password while using a new computer, or using the same proxy as the botnet?</p>\n\n<p>There are other ways other than lockouts to <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/42271/how-can-you-i-detect-low-frequency-brute-forcing-over-multiple-connections\">rate-limit attackers, like asking for CAPTCHA</a>. However, there are <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448963/has-recaptcha-been-cracked-hacked-ocrd-defeated-broken/549859#549859\">some ways to work around CAPTCHA</a>.  This <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blocking_Brute_Force_Attacks\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OWASP page</a> discusses more of the best ways to block brute-force attacks.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Longer Passwords Help</h2>\n\n<p>A few decades ago when Unix was king, it was considered that five-character passwords <a href=\"https://spqr.eecs.umich.edu/courses/cs660sp11/papers/10.1.1.128.1635.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">were pretty good</a>.  Now the stakes are higher, advanced hardware is cheap, and hashes can be broken faster than ever so the requirements for good passwords are higher.  This is part of the reason more companies are pushing for longer passwords.</p>\n\n<p>Longer passwords help because the difficulty of password cracking goes up exponentially with password complexity.  <strong>Just adding one random word to your password can make it thousands of times more expensive to guess</strong>- the difference between seconds and hours of cracking time.  Adding another random word turns those hours into years.</p>\n\n<p>Many people advocate for using symbols and creating passwords from larger and larger character sets to make passwords more difficult to crack.

        "sft_target": " <p>There are two parts to your concern about password length, the threat model and the rationale behind longer passwords.  As you state,  a lot of websites have protections against common attacks, and if the password database hasn't been leaked, your password isn't easily guessable, and online protections against brute-force protections are in place, longer passwords don't make much of a difference.  When those assumptions fail, long passwords can make sure your password is too expensive to crack, as demonstrated in research.  The more general case of this question, \"Why have strong passwords at all?\", is covered in <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/52031/why-does-password-strength-matter/52039\">this question.</a></p>\n\n<h2>Threat Model</h2>\n\n<p>The threat most password policies are concerned with is an attacker trying to crack the hash of the password which has been stolen or leaked from the system, also known as an offline attack.  This usually has some of the strictest requirements. However, these offline attacks aren't the only threat model.  You password could be compromised in other ways, like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Brute-force on the website itself, as you mentioned:  Most secure websites have protections against this, which are further discussed below. Long passwords do help you from online brute-force attacks, although the cost/attempt is much higher than an offline password cracker.  These kind of attacks are somewhat common.</li>\n<li>You reused a password and the password was compromised elsewhere:  The only prevention here is to not reuse passwords. Password length won't help here and too stringent of password requirements might even discourage users from setting a different password for each site.</li>\n<li>A friend, colleague, or social engineer is trying to guess your password based on their knowledge of you: While password length helps here, you don't need very long passwords to stop this attack, and often services are rate limited to only a few attempts per hour per computer.</li>\n<li>There are also methods like phishing, exploiting the password reset, and stealing a plaintext database. In all of those threats it doesn't matter how complicated your password is; it's gone anyways.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Focusing just on online attacks and limiting log-in attempts is bad practice because password database leaks do happen.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkj3n7/myspace-data-breach-427-million-passwords-available-online\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MySpace</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/07/adobe-password-leak-can-check\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Adobe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/31/dropbox-hack-passwords-68m-data-breach\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dropbox</a>, and others have all had password hashes stolen. You can check if you appear on any public leaks <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Don't Websites Block Online Brute-Force Attempts?</h2>\n\n<p>A major part of your question appears to be why password requirements are such a big deal if protections against brute-force attacks are in place.  PCI compliance, for example, requires account lock-out for at least 30 minutes after 6 failed attempts. The biggest problem in preventing these attacks is working against botnets with thousands of computers without causing a denial of service.  How do you prevent thousands of computers each trying to log in a few times without also locking out the user when they mistype their password while using a new computer, or using the same proxy as the botnet?</p>\n\n<p>There are other ways other than lockouts to <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/42271/how-can-you-i-detect-low-frequency-brute-forcing-over-multiple-connections\">rate-limit attackers, like asking for CAPTCHA</a>. However, there are <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448963/has-recaptcha-been-cracked-hacked-ocrd-defeated-broken/549859#549859\">some ways to work around CAPTCHA</a>.  This <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blocking_Brute_Force_Attacks\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OWASP page</a> discusses more of the best ways to block brute-force attacks.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Longer Passwords Help</h2>\n\n<p>A few decades ago when Unix was king, it was considered that five-character passwords <a href=\"https://spqr.eecs.umich.edu/courses/cs660sp11/papers/10.1.1.128.1635.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">were pretty good</a>.  Now the stakes are higher, advanced hardware is cheap, and hashes can be broken faster than ever so the requirements for good passwords are higher.  This is part of the reason more companies are pushing for longer passwords.</p>\n\n<p>Longer passwords help because the difficulty of password cracking goes up exponentially with password complexity.  <strong>Just adding one random word to your password can make it thousands of times more expensive to guess</strong>- the difference between seconds and hours of cracking time.  Adding another random word turns those hours into years.</p>\n\n<p>Many people advocate for using symbols and creating passwords from larger and larger character sets to make passwords more difficult to crack.  However, <a href=\"http://www.guanotronic.com/~serge/papers/chi11b.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">several</a> <a href=\"http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2012/papers/4681a523.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">examples</a> in <a href=\"http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2012/papers/4681a523.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">research</a> show that requiring longer passwords instead of very complex passwords leads to harder-to-crack passwords (and is more user friendly).

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I have read a lot of users saying that you have to hash IP addresses - and a lot of others who say I don't have to because it is not private information.</p>\n\n<p>I use IP addresses for identifying users, because they can download files but have limited traffic (per day).</p>\n\n<p>Are there articles or blog posts where this is illustrated or opinions from people who know more about privacy things like this?</p>\n\n<p>I obviously tried searching on Google - but there are almost no suitable results.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p><strong>No.</strong> (with possible caveats)</p>\n\n<p>The risk posed by storing data depends entirely on what data you collect and how you use it.</p>\n\n<p>If you log IP addresses only then there should be no problem.</p>\n\n<p>If your log contains IP addresses and names you start getting closer to the boundary, but are still probably okay in most jurisdictions.</p>\n\n<p>If your log contains IP addresses, names, actual addresses, health or medical information etc then you will fall foul of a few regulations. That said, the requirement is to encrypt the PII, not the IP address, although sometimes IP address <strong>can</strong> be PII (see <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/a/74115\">Xander's answer</a>).</p>\n\n<p>My caveat is if you provide a service to users in regimes that may punish users, then hashing may help them be safer, as if you are forced to give up your logs they will not necessarily help. </p>\n",
            " <p>So IPs can in fact be considered to be PII (or personally identifiable information) in some cases, so you're right to want to consider whether you need to protect them. Generally this doesn't mean, however, going to any additional lengths beyond how you would protect other PII, say, email addresses for example.   </p>\n\n<p>In any case, traditional hashing is likely going to be an ineffective mechanism.  There are only 4 billion IP v4 addresses potentially in existence, and the reality is that you're probably dealing with a far smaller address space that that.  This means that it's relatively easy for an attacker with the hashes to compute the IP addresses that result in those hashes.  Salting is generally not useful in this case, because you presumably want to know when two requests are associated with the same IP address, and you will not be able to easily compare an existing hashes to the hash of the IP address associated with a new request if all of the hashes are uniquely salted.  </p>\n\n<p>You could, potentially use a keyed hash without a salt, using a function like HMAC.   This, presuming you can keep the key secure will lead to hashes that can be compared to each other, but also cannot be associated to the IP addresses that were used to create them by an attacker who has the hashes, but not the key.  If the key is obtained by the attacker however, this is no more secure than traditional hashing.  </p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, I'd suggest that the risk here doesn't demand the complexity of a mitigation of this level.   I think the complexity you're adding (and need to maintain) probably outweighs the additional security you'd get.   However, if for your application does in fact require you to consider IP addresses to be sensitive enough to warrant extraordinary protection, consider using a keyed hash function.  </p>\n",
            " <p>This clearly depends on the jurisdiction!\nIn Germany, IP addresses are considered personal information!\nSee e.g. <a href=\"http://rechtsanwalt-schwenke.de/die-vorratsdatenspeicherung-fuer-den-hausgebrauch-oder-darf-man-ip-adressen-der-websitebesucher-speichern/\">here</a> or <a href=\"http://www.e-recht24.de/news/datenschutz/7646-speircherung-dynamische-ip-adressen.html\">here</a> if you speak German.</p>\n\n<p>It says, basically, that you are allowed to store the IP only as long as you need it to provide the service! This means on a website, you have to delete it after you sent all IP packets to the destination (which basically means you are not allowed to log it in any usual way, only store it in the webserver memory)\nThere are exceptions e.g. for fraud prevention on e-commerce sites. But then you have to delete it after you don't need it anymore (which is after you got the money)! </p>\n\n<p>You should be fine if you remove the last block of the IP address, because then it doesn't identify a single person anymore. That's also suggested by several government related organisations as the proper way! Hashing IPv4 addresses won't work, because it is easy to calculate the IP from the hash. I don't know what is suggested for IPv6 addresses. Removing the last few bits won't work obviously, because usually one gets a /64 subnet!</p>\n\n<p>The same in <a href=\"https://www.wko.at/Content.Node/branchen/oe/sparte_iuc/Werbung-und-Marktkommunikation/Zustimmungserklaerung_fuer_Speicherung_von_Kundendaten_bei.html\">Austria</a> where you even have to <a href=\"https://www.wko.at/Content.Node/Service/Wirtschaftsrecht-und-Gewerberecht/Verwaltungs--und-Verfassungsrecht/Datenschutz/Meldeverpflichtung_beim_Datenverarbeitungsregister_DVR-Nr..html\">notify</a> a government agency that you are handling personal data!!!\nYou could in theory even get a fine if you don't register there!

As a short example, while a compressor would usually not be able to compress the output of a simple RNG by much, observing even a few outputs might be enough to predict the next state. Similarly, if a few points describe the curve the mouse is making, one can extrapolate many of the other points. I'm not saying the source is irrelevant, but I also don't see it as (close to) conclusive evidence.</li>\n<li>Reading the comment thread after writing the above, I found it funny to see someone saying \"Estimating [unpredictability of] user mouse movement is a complicated human factors question.. there is probably some academic research on that already\". You don't say!</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It might be relevant to mention that a quick look at the Puttygen source code indicates that it seems to generates private keys <em>solely</em> based on mouse movements. It fills an array with the time of mouse movement events in the even cells and the mouse position in the odd cells, sprinkles some magic shuffling over it (shuffling memory, xoring fields), and calls some RSA/DSA/EC* key generator with the array as argument. Whether there is serious evidence that mouse movement is a good entropy source is quite important for such use-cases. Note that this is different from using it as an <em>additional</em> source, such as in the Linux kernel, which will only increase the quality even if it's a mediocre source.</p>\n\n<p>I have a hard time believing nobody ever looked into this.

Even if we flex as hard as we can, we never activate 100% of the muscle's motor units (if we did, it could cause physical damage to the tendon).

Millions of cycles can pass by due to the random delays intrinsic to neural transmission, and these random delays can be measured and used as a source of entropy. While we do not have any research showing exactly how many bits of entropy each action potential will generate, we can make an extremely conservative guess and say that the entire process, from brain to muscle to keystroke, leaves us with around a single bit of entropy.

            " <p>Any data you upload to Google Drive (or Skydrive, or Dropbox for that matter) should be considered duplicated by the NSA. Apart from arbitrary queries from the aforementioned secret service, law enforcement agencies from any country may gain access to them through legal means (subpoenas and so on). And of course, Google engineers could in theory browse your files.</p>\n\n<p>As for what happens when you delete them, who knows? It is a good working assumption to consider that any data uploaded will stay on their servers forever. Realistically, I suppose it does get deleted <em>at some point</em>, but considering how much replication they must have, it may be a while. Your guess is as good as mine.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line, it is not trivial to set up off-site backups for confidential data. The only thing you can trust (or hope to trust) is cryptography. Look into <a href=\"http://duplicity.nongnu.org/\">duplicity</a> and other backup tools which support strong encryption!</p>\n",
            " <p>Not instantly. Although, that's what I want to believe. What you could do is the following. Download the Truecrypt version 7.1a and create an encrypted storage file (option 1 from the wizard) and choose 3 algorithm based encryption with a SHA-512 key. Put all your sensitive files in here and upload the encrypted file to Google Drive. When you want to work with your files. THIS IS IMPORTANT: Copy the encrypted file OUT of Google Drive, perform your work, encrypt and put the encrypted storage file back on Google Drive. This should keep your data safe.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to delete it, just delete the encrypted storage file, nothing they can recover without your key.</p>\n\n<p>PS: Since a short time you can ask Google to explicitly wipe your search data. If you just delete your search history through your user control panel in google than it is still used for advertisement. (scumbag, I know)</p>\n",

Like others stated, if your data is encrypted in a strong manner on your disk and uploaded in the same way I would regard the online version more safe in terms of redundancy (google is managing the replication and backup of their cloud). Stealing or breaking your machine with your data then has no effect.</p>\n\n<p>If your data is not encrypted you still assume at this moment, that your data is totally secure on your disk and not accessible from the NSA. Depending on your operating system this might not even be the truth. Even if you can guarantee that your OS is free of any spyware, there is a chance that you cannot say the same for the channels through which you obtained the data.

Nobody other than Google technicians will know the answer to this question, and of those probably only the engineers who maintain the filers and the data distribution structure. </p>\n\n<p>To give you an idea of how truly \"privy\" that information is: I used to work at Yahoo as a Unix sysadmin, but I didn't work with the filer infrastructure and so even I don't know what the answer to that question would be for Yahoo data, although I spent a year working in the operations group for two of the departments there.. Only the engineers directly responsible for that infrastructure are going to know if the data is truly \"deleted\" or not (and to what level of deletion, if that makes sense to you).</p>\n\n<p>most likely, the file system pointers to the data are deleted within one or two days (depending on how long it takes to propagate through Google's infrastructure), while the actual data itself continues to reside on hard disk until it is overwritten: meaning the data (or parts of it) could theoretically (and fairly easily if someone made the effort) be recovered many months later. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding other agencies or companies with access to this data? Nah .... the only way the NSA or somebody could access it is if they have employees working at Google. Unlikely. And even if they do, do they have root access on the servers in question? Not likely. As someone else mentioned, theoretically the government can get access through a subpoena process. But from a practical perspective do these people have willy-nilly access to John Anybody's data? Nah. </p>\n\n<p>The only people who theoretically intercept your data when you upload it are the system administrators and operations engineers who work at the companies that provide the network backbone for the internet: such as UUNet. I know for a fact these people for many years have scanned internet traffic for illegal content, because years ago when I lived in Virginia I interviewed with UUNet for a job which involved this work. They offered the job to me, but I didn't take it because I accepted a job elsewhere at the time.</p>\n",

It's also hosted in Switzerland to take advantage of that country's strong privacy laws.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it has the same downside as all true encryption, which is that if you lose your password, there's nothing they can do to help you.</p>\n"

            " <p>The Snowden leaks provide interesting insight about what is plausibly the most resourceful man-in-the-middle: the Five Eyes collaboration (NSA, GCHQ, etc.) as of a few years ago. (It's of course possible that they made a huge breakthrough in the last few years, but that's not very likely.) I'm basing most of this answer on <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/inside-the-nsa-s-war-on-internet-security-a-1010361.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this December 2014 article in <em>Der Spiegel</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>Commonly-used cryptographic algorithms such as AES, RSA, etc. are considered safe. That doesn't mean that all protocols and software that use them are safe: the software or even the protocols might be buggy, the servers that store keys might be only a court order away from spilling all their secrets, and the clients (and even the server) are only a malware infection away from being compromised.</p>\n\n<p>HTTPS is not considered secure because a government-level attacker can often obtain server keys through legal means or intimidation, or can force a certification authority to generate fake certificates. Many HTTPS conversations without <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy\" rel=\"nofollow\">forward secrecy</a> are recorded, and decrypted later if the agency decides that one of the parties is of enough interest to expend the effort of acquiring the key.</p>\n\n<p>Some technologies that can be considered secure (in that NSA considers them to be problematic because they aren't able to break them) \u2014\u00a0of course with the <em>caveat</em> that all machines involved must be secure, that keys must be distributed securely, etc.:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy\" rel=\"nofollow\">PGP</a>/<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard\" rel=\"nofollow\">GPG</a> (the agency knows who talks to whom and when but not the message content)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging\" rel=\"nofollow\">OTR messaging</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
            " <p>The problem with non face to face communication is you rely on the end point on having enough security wherewithal to not behave like the weakest link. Unfortunately, not everyone has the same security posture. What this means is, within the web of trust, you can be assured that you can only trust some of the players as trustworthy actors. Everyone else has, a rather fluid trust level. And this is just like real life. You wouldn't trust some people with your bank account, but you might trust them to hold onto 400 dollars, but not give you a great recommendation for shoes for instance. </p>\n\n<p>Why is this important? You can securely communicate with the other person, but up to a certain threshold. If your life depended on being able to securely communicate, nothing beats an in real life dropoff of some sort. Sneakernet is the unfortunate result of this day and age.</p>\n\n<p>But, assuming you're just talking about flower delivery and the like. PKI works fine. However if you're the one doing the flower delivery, you'll have to take into account the business risk of breaches and whatnot, of which fraudulent transactions over compromised links would be one.</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Our communication department recently asked us (the security team) a question. They send out a lot of mail, especially mails like 'your password is set to expire' are hot topics here. The question was: Should we write out the links? We have 'domain.com/passwordreset'. Should we add 'www'? Should we add 'https'? Should we just make it a link of text 'Click here'?</p>\n\n<p>I checked some email I personally got from banks and noticed that it is usually a string that then contains a link, but those companies do that because they want to track who clicks the links and the links are thus really long. The URLs our communication department is trying to communicate are short URLs that they would love for people to remember outside of the email as well.</p>\n\n<p>I looked around, but could not find any practical experience with this online.

They can then share the encrypt files with people </p>\n\n<p>I will then build a desktop application in C++ where a user can select the file and decrypt it locally on thier desktop with a password </p>\n\n<p>Option1:PGP\nMy first thought was to use pgp, now if i securely stored a private and public keypair on the server then all users files could be enceypted easily enough on the server with the users password. But my desktop application wont be able to decrypt the file with just a password i would have to bake the private key into my desktop application </p>\n\n<p>Question1: if my desktop application is compiled could an attacker decompile the application and get hold of the private key, is there a way to securely store data in a compiled program to prevent such a breach. </p>\n\n<p>Option2: AES\nAnother method i thought was that i use a hashing algorithm to hash the users password and then use that hash as a key for encrypting the file using AES encryption. Then on my desktop application i use the same hashing algorithm to recreate the key when the recipent of the file enters the password to decrypt the file</p>\n\n<p>Question2: same problem, if an attaker decompiles my program and see what hashing algorithm im using am i back to square one, now they can just generate hashes and brute force the file open</p>\n\n<p>Question3: does anyone know of a better way to implement this</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: <p>The Environment: Working in an old production SP2010 Standard Farm.  I have a ridiculously simple SPDesigner workflow that just has a single action to Update the list item and set the contents of a field to be a link to a form I built to print the list item in a pretty way.  I have the workflow bound to OnCreate and OnChange.  I publish the workflow and everything works properly.</p>\n\n<p>The Problem:\nEvery few months the workflow suddenly stops generating the print link.  When I investigate I can see that the workflow isn't trying to run (i.e. It doesn't say \"Cancelled\" or \"Failed\" or \"Complete\" in the Workflow execution column of the list ... the column is just blank.  Similarly the workflow history list doesn't get any entries when I add items to the list either.)  So I open up Designer and check the workflow and it says it is still bound to Create and Change.  However, the only way to fix the workflow is to publish it again.</p>\n\n<p>The Question: I'm at my wits end to try and troubleshoot this problem.  Has anybody encountered anything similar?  Does anybody have any suggestions as to how I might troubleshoot this?  (I should probably mention that I don't have server access to this farm, so I'm restricted to things I can accomplish through Designer, CSOM, and the web UI)</p>\n\n<p>Help me StackExchange ... you're my only hope!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: \nHere is exactly what the workflow does...</p>\n\n<p>Step 1</p>\n\n<p>Set Variable: url to /site/restOfPath/ListName/PrintView.aspx?ID=[%Current Item:ID%], print</p>\n\n<p>then Update item in Current Item (to set column printLink = Variable: url, where the printLink column is of type HyperLink)</p>\n\n<p>...that's all.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Environment: SP2010 Enterprise, VS2012</p>\n\n<p>I've been using C# to programmatically create alerts for various users and implementing the alert.Filter property to assign filters that point to specific directories. It's simple enough to create a variable for the path to insert into the filter, but when it comes to the username, passing a variable in its place does not seem to work using any method I have tried. CAML (or at least the pseudo-CAML used in filters) likes the user's name to actually be the name <strong>field</strong> (in this case, pulled from AD) not the <strong>account</strong> name. So after a little playing around I figured out how to turn that into a variable to pass into the filter like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>string userName = vUser.Name;\nstring oFilter = (\"&lt;Query&gt;&lt;And&gt;&lt;Or&gt;&lt;Eq&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='ItemFullUrl'/&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + fullPath + \"&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Eq&gt;&lt;BeginsWith&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='ItemFullUrl'/&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + fullPath + \"/&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/BeginsWith&gt;&lt;/Or&gt;&lt;Neq&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + userName + \"&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='Editor/New'/&gt;&lt;/Neq&gt;&lt;/And&gt;&lt;/Query&gt;)\");\noAlert.Filter = oFilter;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The user.Name property outputs a name that matches the format in the CAML filter of a working alert I examined. If I type the name directly into the filter it works fine, but when I try to pass it as a variable it breaks, even if I explicitly set the variable to \"User Name\".</p>\n\n<p>Is there some part of how the filter/string works that I'm not accounting for? Every search I've done online has said this method should work, in theory. My goal is simply to make the alert apply only to changes made by other users, is there perhaps another way to accomplish that?</p>\n\n<p>Any advice is greatly appreciated!</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

It seems that the feature upgrade code has a bug though.\nThe upgrade doesn't work if the hidden CustomTiles lists have never been created. These lists get created when you enable the feature.\nSo what you have to do is enabling the CustomTiles feature on every web application in your farm.<br/>You can do so using Powershell:\nEnable-SPFeature -Identity CustomTiles -Url <i>UrlOfYourWebApplication</i> -Force\n<br/>After enabling the feature (which creates the hidden list) the upgrade worked for us without any errors.\n<br/>If you want to know more about CustomTiles before enabling the feature see this TechNet article: <a href=\"https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt790697(v=office.16).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt790697(v=office.16).aspx</a>\n<br/>HTH<br/>Christian</p>\n",

If you may keep the database in a partition which is formatted as 64 KB, that will increase SharePoint 2013 performance directly.</p></li>\n<li><p>On the hand, as default SQL databases increases size by 2 MB each time when needed.

Its not a how-to answer but it could leads to solve some problem</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Installing the root certificate, disable the clr check or send clr.microsoft.com to the 127.0.0.1. It speed ups the \"awake\" of the websites. Sometimes considerably. Its also a must have trick for SharePoint 2010.</li>\n<li>Configure Noderunner to use less memory. Noderunner is configure to use so much memory and it spans over 4 process, each one consuming usually between 300mb-600mb (in total 600x4 = 1.4gb), each one consuming a lot of memory. It could be disable to 256mb or even 128mb.</li>\n<li>Disable distributed cache.</li>\n<li>Configure the search service. By default, its configure to about to collect information every minute and its overkill for most system (even for a 24gb machine).   While its possible to disable it but i suggest to configure it correctly to run every hour or every day.</li>\n<li>Timer Service. If you are updating then, disabling it could speed up the process. </li>\n<li>Disable the service that you don't want to use.</li>\n<li>A proper configuration of SharePoint involves a farm of several machines. Specially the database should be installed in a different machine.   However, a dev/testing machine usually includes domain + sql server + sharepoint in the same box.</li>\n<li>Disable Health and Usage Service.</li>\n<li>Update SharePoint 2013.  Don't forget to also update the database.</li>\n<li>Lastly : SharePoint 2010 is way more resource friendly. <em>wink</em> <em>wink</em> ;-)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Optionally:</p>\n\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li>Configure Sql Server to use another partition/disk. Also you can configure sql server to limit the memory used (usually its configured to use over 2 trillions of bytes).</li>\n<li>In some cases, Sharepoint 2013 Online is quite inexpensive. Its not blazing fast but its usable.  It costs about $8 per user per month.</li>\n</ol>\n",

Major design mistakes that I made when I started are beginning to pile up and effect my design going forward. It takes longer and longer to implement anything new.</p>\n\n<p>I'm on a tight deadline and finding it harder and harder to write good, DRY, SOLID, code. It's becoming more enticing to copy/paste chunks of code to make slight variations to it's behavior as design time goes up. It's also taking a long time to get back into the code base whenever I have to do a context switch (From one project then back to this one), I have a feeling of dread whenever I go back to work on this project.</p>\n\n<p>What steps can I take to remedy this?

Some <code>Car</code>s can be <code>inHybridMode</code> but not all of them. The server currently supplies three specific models in a list: <code>Prius</code>, <code>Camaro</code>, and <code>F150</code>. In the client I have created this hierarchy:</p>\n\n<pre><code>abstract class Vehicle\n    String name;\n\nabstract class Car extends Vehicle\n\nabstract class Truck extends Vehicle\n\ninterface Hybrid\n    boolean isInHybridMode()    \n\nclass Prius extends Car, implements Hybrid\n\nclass Camaro extends Car\n\nclass F150 extends Truck\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've chosen to make <code>Hybrid</code> an interface so that the inheritance structure is not crazy (and super messy if ever got a hybrid truck).</p>\n\n<p>The client can easily create these vehicles from the server output (let's say JSON).

This will cause problems when I try to do <code>vehicles.size()</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make <code>Vehicle</code> (and <code>Car</code> and <code>Truck</code>) non-abstract and just create a <code>Vehicle</code> object with corresponding <code>name</code> field</p></li>\n<li><p>Create a new class called <code>UnknownHybrid extends Car, implements Hybrid</code>.

Camry, Camaro, F150, etc. is the model.</p></li>\n<li><p>I only need Car, Truck, and Hybrid behavior. There is no such thing as Camry behavior, only in that it is Car + Hybrid behavior. </p>\n\n<p>I added the model classes (Camry, F150, etc.) so that I'd have a class which could implement <code>Hybrid</code> interface. I <em>think</em> I'll have fewer models than combinations of interfaces. Eventually I'll have other \"mix in\" behavior like <code>Convertible</code>, <code>4WD</code>, etc. So I thought I'd just create classes for each model instead of each combination of interface (HybridConvertibleCar, etc.)</p></li>\n<li><p>As for business requirements: display info about Car, display info about Truck, display green indicator when in Hybrid mode, handle unknown models that may or may not be hybrid, convertible, 4wd. </p>\n\n<p>The thing I'm trying to avoid (and the current implementation) is that all of the behavior for hybrid, convertible, 4wd is all contained in the <code>Vehicle</code> class. So I have a lot of models that have fields/methods that don't pertain to them. For example Truck has an <code>isConvertibleTopDown</code> method that always returns \"false\". </p></li>\n<li><p>There is more to <code>Hybrid</code> than just isInHybridMode.

You shove Camry data into a <code>Car</code> datatype because you want <code>Car</code> behavior with this data.

Good luck with that.</p>\n\n<p>If <code>inHybridMode</code> is the only member of a hybrid vehicle I would not make an interface for it.

It would be somewhat \"flattening\" to your model but it would solve your problem, which is you want to be ready for the unexpected. You want a universal vehicle that will fit anything the server throws at you, a one-size-fits-all class that can survive a little tweaking at the server side.</p>\n",
            " <p>Perhaps, you should take a step back from the <em>concrete</em> problem and think about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_analysis_and_design\" rel=\"nofollow\">OOAD</a> in general.</p>\n\n<p>In general terms: In your program you are building a <code>model</code> of something. The <code>things</code> you model and <em>how</em> you model these things is completely up to you. It's like inventing a game, where you set up the rules. Whether this game makes \"any sense\", i.e. whether it serves any practical purpose and how good you achieved this purpose with your software is one of the facets, which makes the quality of our software. </p>\n\n<p>And one (popular) way to build models is <code>OOP</code>. One strength of <code>OOP</code> as such is building <em>abstract</em> groups of <code>objects</code> via <code>inheritance</code>.</p>\n\n<p>If one <code>object</code> inherits from another it has somehow a relationship or <em>similarity</em> which it shares with other members of the group.</p>\n\n<p>This is the so called <code>is-a</code>-relationship, where you form a group of objects. Languages like Java, C# etc. allow two types  of inheritance: <code>class inheritance</code> and <code>interface inheritance</code>, i.e. one thing <code>is</code> like another or <code>behaves</code> like another object. </p>\n\n<p>If I have similar objects, e.g. <code>car</code> it would make sense to model them as <code>class inheritance</code>. If I have objects, which share a common ability - <em>able to fly</em> -, it makes sense, to model them as <code>interface</code> inheritance.</p>\n\n<p>What makes <code>OOP</code> so useful is to group heterogenous objects together and treat them the same. For Example: You could tell a collection of Objects, which are able to <em>fly</em>, just to do that <code>.fly()</code> and <em>independendly</em> how they manage to do that, you are able to speak to each of them.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>From what was said above you are able to understand, that your question sounds a bit strange:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Inheritence structure to allow unknown types</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This somehow contradicts what you are trying to achive with <code>OOP</code>.\nOf course, if you are dealing with heterogenous objects you can not exactly determine <em>what</em> it does, but you know in what respect this behaviour would be <em>known</em>, since you (hopefully) modeled the groups like that.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My question is, how can I handle the situation where the server returns me a vehicle that I don't (yet) have a concrete class for?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you would ever end up in such a situation, you know, that your <em>model is just wrong</em>.</p>\n\n<p>If I take your example of <code>Trucks</code> and <code>Cars</code> and <code>being hybrid</code> - independently, whether I think you modeled it correctly:</p>\n\n<p>Whatever your front-end is able to model has to be modeled in the backend as well. Say your frontend models a <code>hybrid</code> Truck, the backend has to translate this to a call to a <code>factory</code>, which knows <em>how to deal with that</em>. </p>\n\n<p>If there is no possibility to \"build a car\" like it was \"ordered\", the result is <em>exceptional</em> behaviour.</p>\n\n<p><em>Answer:</em> Fix your model of the world.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My options are: ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <em>fix</em> would be to build a <em>better</em> abstraction. According to your model, it would make sense having an abstract factory, returning you a concrete factory, returning you a concrete object; i.e. a <em>vehicle factory</em> producing a <em>truckfactory</em> or <em>carfactory</em>, which in turn produce <em>concrete</em> (non-)<em>hybrid</em> vehicles of their kind.</p>\n\n<p>To give a more concrete advice, I need more detailed information, about what you want to achieve.  </p>\n",

If you are customizing because you like customization and not because it is a requirement, you are customizing too much. If you have a genuine requirement to customize, you should still question if it is a good idea and find out the underlying reason why they think they need customization.

Customizability is a lot more palatable if stuff works reasonably well even if you don't customize it.  For example, I hate vi because its out-of-the-box behavior in terms of what the backspace and arrow keys do is so different from the convention on the rest of the machine.  I know this can be customized away, but when I walk up to a stock machine it's basically unusable until I waste a bunch of time fiddling.</p></li>\n<li><p>You've made your program so customizable that its look and feel is effectively different on every machine, Linux distro, etc. and you effectively can't \"learn once, use everywhere\".  Again, see vi.</p></li>\n<li><p>You've built an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_platform\" rel=\"nofollow\">inner platform</a> such that the user would be better off just using the outer platform to accomplish what he/she wants.  For example, once a text editor or command line text processing tool gets too powerful, it's probably easier to just write a quick-and-dirty, ad-hoc Python script to do the more complex text manipulations than to learn how to do them using the inner platform.  Similarly, once a plotting library becomes too powerful, it's probably better to just let the user directly interact with the GUI library it's built on top of to customize the finer details of the plot.</p></li>\n</ol>\n",

Making it easier to move customizations around would help somewhat (consider emacs users and their site-lisp files), but often I'd find that too much bother anyway.</p>\n\n<p>If your app won't work well out of the box, but needs to be customized, you've failed.</p>\n\n<p>I do want my favorite software on a machine, but I don't think that's what you mean by customization.</p>\n\n<p>One issue with customizability is that it's a promise to each and every customer that you have to respect.  You send out version A, and your customers customize.  All well and good.  Now, what do you do with version B?  If you break your customers' customizations, they'll be upset, and if you do it more than once, they'll be very reluctant to customize, so you'll be left with customization functionality that very few people use, along with annoyed customers.</p>\n\n<p>This means that you have to pay attention to what customization you've involved with each upgrade.

Think the customization system thoroughly and allow for information to get back to you in a meaningful way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>From the application user's point of view</strong>, that's when the user feels like setting up the application is daunting, often because it's akin to programming, for a loose definition of \"programming\" (This includes GUI-oriented programming or <em>Blinkenswitches</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Yes <strong>the line is a blur</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Yes sometimes a good code or GUI (re)design can make the application switch board <em>even with the same customizable feature set</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Create a <strong>learning curve</strong> between \"casual\", \"advanced\" and \"expert\" settings. It could go all the way to providing an API and/or scripting. All users are not starting on an equal foot: a tiered system will <strong>make each one feel at home</strong>. It can also create a sense of <strong>progress and achievement</strong> when a beginner switches from \"curated\" to \"advanced\".</p>\n\n<p>Good examples in various areas include Firefox (preferences, about:config, userchrome.css&amp;al.), Chrome (basic settings vs \"Under the hood\"), Mac OS X (pref panes, \"defaults(1)\", applescript/automator), or even Vim's vimrc. Bad examples include any application whose settings pane feels like a maze. I'm sure you could name half a dozen from the top of your head (unless they traumatized you into forgetting them).</p>\n",

Everything else, that is more complicated you can put into some configuration file or some other means that is accessible from a configuration tool or something.</p>\n\n<p>That way, your most common, unspecialized users have access to the basic configurations they need to use the app, while your more specialized, expert or otherwise more interested users, can use the extra configurations to suit their highly specialized needs.</p>\n\n<p>I think this is the best trade-off between having a user-friendly and highly customizable app. The success of this, though, is how you split the configurations. Which are the important ones, which are just for fancy tweaks? That's the hard part I think. And don't forget to add a reset to defaults button, in case someone messes something up.</p>\n"

However, there is one step I can't seem to find an answer for.  </p>\n\n<p>Before the existence of a full on, tool filled operating system, how would one even write a simple boot loader for a computer that doesn't any have a boot loader, or anything for that matter, in its boot sector?  What would the very first step be after acquiring a computer with the bare minimal? (I.e., screen, keyboard, processor, ram, hdd, floppy)</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>You need some way to create a ROM or EEPROM chip that can be installed on the motherboard and contains the bootloader. There's really a series of boot steps, starting with internal checks by the various chips (CPU, video card etc) followed by bus activation and discovery (the PCI-e bus controller locates everything connected to it and assigns IDs etc). Then the motherboard looks for a boot ROM and runs that code, which in turn finds the BIOS boot order and looks through that for a matching device, then loads the booter from that. Which in turn loads an OS.</p>\n\n<p>The original boot chain was flicking switches that formed the ROM, then later using switches to program RAM, and so on right up to the modern multi-stage bootloaders. </p>\n",

            " <p>In the really ancient days (such as the IBM 650 or PDP1) it was necessary to enter values into memory using front panel switches.  Looking at pictures of really early computers, you saw two rows of lights - Address and Data.  On a 16-bit computer there were 16 of these running across, usually color coded in groups of three or four for octal or hex, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>The 'Reset' button would set the 'Address' counter to zero.  One could then set the switches on the data bus to the desired value, and toggle the 'data write' button.  This would write the switch settings into the memory at address 0.  There were up-down toggle switches to allow you to move to the next or previous address.  You could also set the switches for the address, and click 'address write'.  Whatever was at that new address would be displayed on the 16 data lights.</p>\n\n<p>Typically one would toggle in, using this technique, a read loop for reading values out of a card reader or paper tape.  This would be just enough to load a larger block of code to proceed with the OS or application load.  At the time, such computers had 4K to 16K words (or 8K to 32K bytes) so such loaders were tiny by modern standards.  A read loop might only be three or five 16-bit words.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/pan07.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Front panel illustration</a></p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I am writing an enterprise web-forms-frontend application for in-house use. It has Direct access control (DAC) masquerading as Role-based access control (RBAC). </p>\n\n<p>For anonymization purposes, let's call the main unit of information stored in my application a Document, and the roles in the company a Boss, a Grunt and a C-level executive. There are also Externals (e.g. somebody working for a business partner of ours). The general guideline is that everybody but externals should be able to read all documents, C-level execs can write everything, Bosses can write the Documents belonging to their own department, and Grunts can only write Documents personally assigned to them. Fairly standard thus far. </p>\n\n<p>But what users actually want is that they can make arbitrary exceptions to the above. They want that any person in the system can be granted write access to any Document, and that Externals can be granted Read access to any document. (Actually, it is more complicated than that, with more roles and finer granularity of permissions, including management of who can propagate which permission to others, but the above description illustrates the core of the problem well enough). So what I have is basically permissions on a personal level, and the roles are only a convenient way of having default settings for the personal-level permissions when a user or a Document is added to the system, instead of having somebody fill out a whole row or column in an access control matrix by hand. </p>\n\n<p>Now I have already designed a Permissions table in my database, which has a User FK, Document FK and columns for the different types of permissions. What I am not sure is what I should save in the table. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Alternative 1: I save all permissions in this table (pure DAC) and have the logic tier mimic a RBAC. E.g. when a new Boss is added, a row for each Document in the system is added to the DB, with Read permissions for all documents and Write for the Documents of her department. </li>\n<li>Alternative 2: I save the deviations from the role guidelines only. So when a new Boss is added, nothing is written to the permissions table. But when an executive gives a Boss the rights to write to a Document from a different department, then a single row is added to reflect that information. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I am not sure which alternative would be better. The first one feels closer to textbook implementation, and if a principle has made it into a textbook, then there is normally good reason to use it. But in my case, it also hurts the DRY principle - after all, if the information that a C-level exec can write to Document X is derivable from his role, writing a row with this information in the DB is redundant. </p>\n\n<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in terms of a) application performance and b) complexity of implementation? What headaches can I expect from each? </p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that 1) I don't plan to implement a full logic tier. The whole application is practically a convenient CRUD frontend to a database, so I will be doing DB queries for each page view instead of keeping a collection of Document objects in memory. (I know the advantages of a MVC pattern, but it was decided that it will be overkill for this project). 2) I am programming this in ASP .NET 4.5, so the closer I stay to roles, the more I can let the framework do the heavy lifting for me. 3) I have thought of implementing groups orthogonal to the roles to manage access, but it doesn't make sense in my case. </p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>You should not implement your own authorization model but rather use existing ones e.g. an RBAC implementation, claims-based access control, or attribute-based access control (ABAC).</p>\n\n<p>With respect to ABAC, there is an authorization standard that exists which you can use to define your authorization policies. This standard is called XACML, the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language. You can read up on both topics here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://csrc.nist.gov/projects/abac/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NIST's page on attribute-based access control (ABAC)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=xacml\" rel=\"nofollow\">OASIS extensible access control markup language (XACML)</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>XACML defines an architecture with the notion of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a policy decision point (PDP),</li>\n<li>a policy enforcement point (PEP), and</li>\n<li>a policy information point (PIP).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the typical flow, the PEP protects your data / service / API. The PEP would send an authorization request to the PDP:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Can user Alice view record #123?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The PDP would turn to the PIP to retrieve missing attributes e.g. the user's role and clearance as well as resource attributes e.g. the sensitivity of data, a whitelist or blacklist... Based on the new information, the PDP can reach a decision: Permit or Deny. Access is allowed or blocked.</p>\n\n<p>With XACML there is no limit to the richness of the authorization policies. I work for a company, Axiomatics, that implements XACML, and our solutions are used in manufacturing, healthcare, banking to secure access to sensitive data in a dynamic way (e.g. managers can edit documents that they own).</p>\n\n<p>XACML enables externalized authorization that is managed centrally. It also enables what I like to call any-depth authorization meaning that you can apply XACML to web APIs, business logic, presentation UIs, as well as databases.</p>\n\n<p>HTH</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I'm a software developer recently in charge of entire project (project manager). The project I'm working on (with 6 other persons) is a complex Java-based application that's being developed for over 5 years. The entire time we were using SVN, without branching. Now, I would like to switch to Git as I do believe Git will provide superior branching and ease some development.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, before I do switch, I have to tell you about the current workflow we're having with SVN, I have to hear opinion from people experienced with Git and to tell you what are the things I expect from Git. <em>Please</em> tell me if Git can provide the things I need the way I need them, because if I switch the entire project to Git and then it turns out I have to revert it to SVN (for any reason), I would be dead :) .</p>\n\n<p>The principle we're following with SVN is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Each team member is working on a single feature. When such feature is done, a local copy of dev's code is updated against SVN master and feature is deployed for testing. If testing by clients passed, the person developing the code pushes it to our main (and only) branch with a proper commit message that explains the feature, ticket number and so on.</p></li>\n<li><p>If, during \"update before deploying for testing\" the team member gets into conflicts, he's cherry-picking conflicting files line by line.</p></li>\n<li>When time comes that we deploy new features to production, I load the production code from a particular folder on the disk (like \"physical branch\"), I sync that code to the current state of the SVN, going class by class, reviewing committed changed and taking the code meant for that particular deploy. Usually, it happens that out of 230 classes we have in the repo (and not in production workspace) bewteen 30 and 50 classes are with conflicts because of the features we don't need on production yet. Sometimes, clients ask for the latest features <strong>before</strong> wanting some older features. If both feature they want and features they don't affect the same file, I have to manually skip some particular file from commit version number 3 to commit version number 6 <strong>without</strong> taking any changes from commits 4 or 5. Now, if another file is also affected, it happens that another file from version, say, 35, I have to update to version 40 without taking any changes done between 35 and 40.\nWith SVN, it's easy, I sync a particular file and pick only the lines of codes ignoring all others. It takes time but I am in a position to tell clients \"we'll postpone this for X days\".</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also, if two developers are working on different features that largely affect the same subsystem or big number of the same files, in order to avoid nasty conflicts and collisions I usually tell clients \"we can't develop both things in the same time, we'll postpone feature B till feature A is done and tested\" and one of the devs get to work on something else.</p>\n\n<p>Now, from Git the only thing I basically need is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Nice Windows GUI (for SVN we're using \"Subclipse\" plugin for Eclipse). I'm really not into investing a lot of time just learning or remembering how to push a branch or view the history or do something similar if it can be done with the click of a button. For me, the version control system should be just a tool - not something my devs should spend more than a day learning how to use because of CLI and advanced things we'll never use or require. With SVN we use only 4 commands: commit, update, synchronize (to see the differences) and \"history\". Ok, sometimes we do use \"compare with version X from repo\" but not so often.</li>\n<li>The ability to achieve nice code storage by using only a few basic commands (button clicks to be precise :D ): push / pull, fetch / commit, branch / merge, view history. Nothing fancy or advanced which would take a lot of time to learn or understand.</li>\n<li>The ability to partially take commits. For example: commit consists of 10 files. I take all changes from 8 files, but for two files I do cherry-pick in a manner that from current production version 5 I take two lines of code from file commit version 7 and few lines from file commit version 9 (effectively keeping those two files in \"undefined version\" so that I can supply my clients with the newest changes without all code changes preceding that newest feature I want). To achieve this point, for me it's not a problem to allocate an entire day digging through history and commits regardless if it's SVN or Git. That's my \"preparing deploy\" day anyway :)</li>\n<li>Having numerical commit versions, not HASH-based ones!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is it possible with Git? I really have limited experience with Git, only on some small projects and I can't afford to move the entire code base from one system to another :( Please give me some advice.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

Why not start using feature branches <strong>with SVN</strong>?

            " <blockquote>\n  <p>\u2022Nice Windows GUI (for SVN we're using \"Subclipse\" plugin for Eclipse).\n  \u2022The ability to achieve nice code storage by using only a few basic commands (button clicks to be precise :D ): push / pull, fetch / commit, branch / merge, view history. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is a Git integration plugin for Eclipse available from the official Eclipse repository which allows all these operations (under \"Collaboration\" on the \"Install new software...\" screen). This plugin is already included in many of the official Eclipse packages, so you might already have it.</p>\n\n<p>The official Git for Windows also comes with a stand-alone GUI. It doesn't expose the full feature-set of Git, but allows the most common operations.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\u2022The ability to partially take commits. For example: commit consists of 10 files. I take all changes from 8 files, but for two files I do cherry-pick in a manner that from current production version 5 I take two lines of code from file commit version 7 and few lines from file commit version 9 (effectively keeping those two files in \"undefined version\" so that I can supply my clients with the newest changes without all code changes preceding that newest feature I want). To achieve this point, for me it's not a problem to allocate an entire day digging through history and commits regardless if it's SVN or Git. That's my \"preparing deploy\" day anyway :)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In general, Git encourages you to use lots of branches (usually one branch per feature) and commit often on each branch. Commits should never contain two unrelated changes. This should allow you to <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">cherry-pick</a> the features you want by cherry-picking commits. It also allows you to create a release with only the features your customers request by merging the feature-branches which correspond to these features.</p>\n\n<p>So if you have this requirement, you are using Git wrong. </p>\n\n<p>However, if you are ever in the situation where you need to merge only parts of a commit, you should create a new commit on the feature-branch which reverts the changes you don't want and then merge the branch. If you still want to keep working on the features you don't want to merge into mainline, you would create that commit on a new branch which you merge and keep developing on the old branch.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\u2022Having numerical commit versions, not HASH-based ones!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sorry, but Git doesn't do that. Git encourages decentralized, parallel development on multiple branches with multiple commits per branch, so incrementing commit numbers just don't fit into the Git philosophy. However, you can use <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-tag\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tags</a> in Git to manually assign numbers (or other descriptors) to commits. You can do that on your master-branch after merging from the feature-branches.</p>\n"

I would argue that most developers agree that this is the very definition of business logic.  It encapsulates an application behavior that performs a service for a user or task to directly or indirectly further a business goal of creating invoices.  While simply fetching some data on criteria can be argued is not in fact business logic, calculating new data certainly is.</p>\n\n<p>So where do Stored Procedures come into play?  This answer is not so clear and not everybody agrees on the proper role of Stored Procedures.  Not everybody even agrees that stored procedures should ever exist, arguing that they fundamentally blue the line between the data tier and business logic which should ideally exist solely in the application layer.  Others take the other hard line approach that stored procedures should contain as much business logic as possible and the application tier should be thin.</p>\n\n<p>There is always of course the middle road when it comes to stored procedures.  For resource or time intensive tasks where a significant performance advantage can be had by joining records and performing calculations at the database tier, (Eg. analytics, data marts, reports, etc...) then a strong argument can be made for the importance and role of stored procedures in an application.</p>\n",
            " <p>Stored procedures are horrible places for any kind of business logic, and if an ORM masks a stored procedure this is simply for convenience.</p>\n\n<p>Your entire hypothetical code above can be done without stored procedures, and should be. A database in terms of an ORM should mean that the database doesn't matter any more. It becomes just a persistence layer. A stored procedure should only be made if there is no other alternative to a specific problem. </p>\n\n<p>This is of course a strict approach, but my experience in trying to work with both did nothing but frustrate me. I ended up moving all the logic to my code. Stored procedures shield you from the underlying data model, ORM exposes the model to you.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I'm after a bit of OO design advice... I'm about to start developing a Windows application that communicates with an external machine via RS232. The machine has an onboard \"system controller\" consisting of registers (addresses). You can write a value to a register (e.g. to turn a pump on), or read a value from a register (e.g. to see if the pump is running). The app will have a config file detailing each register's settings, e.g. its address, whether it's 16- or 32-bit, a friendly \"alias\" (so other code can deal with \"Pump XYZ\" rather than address \"50B3D124\"), and a few other things.</p>\n\n<p>My first thought was to have a <code>Register</code> class reflecting these properties, plus <code>Read()</code> and <code>Write()</code> methods. But this raises the first question - should the <code>Read()</code> method have a return value, or should it populate a <code>Value</code> property on the class?</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, should the <code>Write()</code> method include a \"valueToWrite\" parameter, or should it write whatever value is currently held in the <code>Value</code> property?</p>\n\n<p>I could take this one step further (possibly even answering the above question) - instead of Read/Write methods, put the functionality into the <code>Value</code> property's getter and setter? Using a property for this purpose doesn't feel right though.</p>\n\n<p>I then started wondering if a <code>Register</code> class was even necessary, as its read/write functionality would be doing little more than calling Read/Write methods on a <code>SystemController</code> class, e.g.</p>\n\n<pre><code>long ReadRegister(string registerAlias);\nvoid WriteRegister(string registerAlias, long value);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Why not just let the rest of the application read/write registers via the  <code>SystemController</code> class? (I suspect I would still need some concept of a <code>Register</code> class, even if it's just to represent a register's config settings).</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

If the remote end of the connection has a few important aspects of state which affect the way communications will be performed (e.g. communications mode settings, or packet sequence numbers), it may be helpful to have the class manage those aspects of state itself, but aspects of state other than communication should be managed by client code.</p>\n\n<p>An alternative design is to have \"read all state\" and \"write all state\" methods, and have the UI flow entail loading state from a device or opting to create new state, editing the state without involving the device, and then storing the state to the device once editing is complete.  This approach will minimize the number of times a user will have to wait for the device, consolidating all delays into one wait at the beginning and one at the end.  The one limitation with this approach is that the user won't be able to see the effect of any changes on the remote device until the \"apply\" button is pressed (since no changes will actually be made until then).

One might for each device property display a read-only and editable field next to each other.  A background task should scan the properties and determine what things need updating on either the screen or in the device, and perform any updates as it notices them.  I would suggest having the read-only text boxes implemented with a custom type with a method that can set the text at any time from any thread.  The method should immediately set a private variable to the new text and <code>BeginInvoke</code> an <code>UpdateText</code> method <em>when no update request is already pending</em>.  If multiple requests are made to set the text before the UI thread has started processing the first one, the repeated operations should not generate multiple <code>BeginInvoke</code> calls.

If for whatever reason, reading back the device state after setting it doesn't yield the new value, code should be prepared to convey that information to the user.  The user might be confused as to why the value isn't updating, but will probably be less confused than if software suggests that the device holds the new value but it really doesn't.</p>\n"

You may scetch out the API in code, you may write down some conceptual comments in natural language, or some high-level pseudo code, but you don't let the implementation details disturb your thought process. It is a top-down approach, opposed to the usual \"bottom-up\" process of TDD. </p>\n\n<p>If you start \"coding a solution first\", you will probably end up in doing no TDD at all: you take a high risk of not writing enough tests to make sure every important aspect of your solution is covered, you take a high risk of implementing things \"just in case\", though you don't need them (yet), and you don't really think about the API requirements from the viewpoint of a user of your API.</p>\n\n<p>This is actually very old wisdom: when I was in school (>30 years ago), I already learned the terms \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" as programming techniques both supporting each other. \"TDD by the book\" just covers the \"bottom-up\" aspect, the \"top-down\" aspect is introduced by explicitly doing (at least a little bit) analysis and design first.</p>\n\n<p>So yes, developing a solution first is fine, but if you want to to TDD, don't implement your solutions in code first before you start to write tests.</p>\n",
            " <p>Both the tests and the implementation code should flow from the requirements.  One of the main ideas behind TDD is that it forces you to think about the interfaces (and keeping them simple) up front, since you need to provide inputs and acquire outputs much the same way that any other consumer of your code would.  But, you should <strong>always</strong> be able to write one without the other if you are thoughtful and your requirements are properly fleshed out.</p>\n\n<p>If you don't know what software you're writing, you need to establish that first as requirements.  If you do, then you should be careful to avoid tightly coupling your tests to the implementation; it makes the system brittle and difficult to update.  What you're suggesting very much sounds like it will result in this, or at least be exactly like following a tests-last methodology while simply making things harder for yourself in the middle.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are certainly cases where requirements-driven tests break down.  Requirements sometimes change, and there's often really nothing you can do about it besides adapt.  (And they have flaws, and you iterate.)  But when only the specific implementation changes, the <em>interface</em> should not; meaning, your tests for those interfaces remain valid.  You can and should add tests as you go along to cover edge cases specific to your implementation, and so on, when following TDD.</p>\n",
            " <p>Yes, it is bad practice.</p>\n\n<p>Not because of your solution phase, but because of your commenting out and contrived TDD tacked on the end.</p>\n\n<p>If you have the solution coded, simply add tests and you are done.</p>\n\n<p>Don't try and squeeze in a practice just because you want to say 'we did TDD'. </p>\n\n<p>Do what works and then say 'we didn't do TDD because solutions don't magically appear from iterative steps'</p>\n\n<p>Choose a name for your new methodology* and write a book about it.

James Shore introduces spikes this way</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We perform small, isolated experiments when we need more information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In TDD, the spike is discarded, and a new implementation is designed from scratch.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Conversely, writing a test seems to be only a speculation that a problem will be solved once it passes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not at all - we frequently get a test to pass by simply hacking the right answer into the production code.  Nobody considers that the problem is \"solved\" at this point, only that the test is <em>calibrated</em>, and will detect a particular fault.</p>\n\n<p>Actually solving the problem usually occurs under the green bar.</p>\n\n<p>To understand the distinction between what you are doing and TDD, it may help to review the difference between <a href=\"http://www.developsense.com/blog/2009/08/testing-vs-checking/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">testing and checking</a>.  In the process you describe, you are adding calibrated <em>checks</em> to the code you have written, but you aren't really testing <em>the design</em>.</p>\n\n<p>TDD deliberately goes the other way around -- we design by writing the tests, and paying attention to how the API feels to use.  Then we create a solution that is constrained by our API design.</p>\n\n<p>Writing checks that conform to a pre-canned solution is one of the techniques that we use to manage <em>legacy</em> code; we're operating under a different set of constraints, so we use different techniques.</p>\n\n<p>But to voluntarily add a legacy constraint when creating something new seems back to front.</p>\n",

If your solution is 5 points, and it would meet the need now, but what they want to do would require 50 points and two sprints or more, the PO may say \"hold on, we have a high priority release of this MVP planned and can't spend 2 weeks building out functionality that isn't on the roadmap!\"</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Let's say I have a grid with square fields. For the fields I have an abstract <code>Field</code> class. This class has several subclasses, for example <code>EmptyField</code> or <code>RoadField</code>. Some of these fields can be connected to each other, thus I have an interface <code>IConnectable</code> that these classes implement. Now every connectable field should have a <code>Connections</code> object. However interfaces can't have member objects. My idea was that instead of an interface I use another abstract class for that, <code>ConnectableField</code>, which is a subclass of <code>Field</code> and the parent class for all connectable classes. But what do I do if I want to add another such abstract class, say a <code>RotatableField</code> which has a <code>Rotation</code> object. I can't make an interface out of it because of the member object. But I also can't inherit from it because a class can only have one base class.

            " <p>Python is a dynamically-typed language. This has two important consequences:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The compiler is unable to reject certain kinds of logical error at compile time which would be caught by a C++ compiler</li>\n<li>Because the types of some (even most) variables cannot be determined at compile time, operations on those variables must be implemented by dynamically dispatching a method call (a fairly slow operation) whereas C++ compilers are often able to generate inline code (which has no overhead). C++ is therefore an inherently faster\nlanguage.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The former of these is actually surprisingly useful. See for example the Boost Units library, which allows scientific and engineering code to be written in a way that allows the compiler to statically check that the calculations have logically consistent unit usage at compile time, with no runtime overhead. This would be impossible in Python.</p>\n\n<p>Python also has very poor support for multithreading. Its language design requires certain operations (for instance modifications to lists) to complete atomically, which has lead to the most common implementation using a global lock to prevent two threads executing Python code at the same time (although if one thread calls native code the other will be allowed to procede), because the overhead of locking and unlocking individual objects made single threaded performance terrible.</p>\n\n<p>C++, on the other hand, leaves the job of ensuring code is thread-safe up to the developer, which allows for efficient multithreading.</p>\n\n<p>C++ also gives developers much more control over memory management, allowing for example generic containers that allocate user-specified object types inside their structures (leading to lower overhead and better locality of reference than is possible with Python), allocating objects in specified memory regions (e.g. so that multiple objects can be deleted in a single operation, or to allocate them in a memory-mapped file) or using developer-supplied custom allocators.</p>\n\n<p>C++ is also loosely typed, which means you can use an area of memory for one type of data, and then change to treating it as containing another type. While operations of this type are dangerous (and the language specification states that programs that do this have \"undefined behavior\"), if you know what you're doing you can use this to implement dynamic loading of code modules, runtime native code generation, direct manipulation of file structures without individually extracting fields as you would have to in Python, and a wide variety of other uses. This is why operating systems can be implemented in C++ and not in Python.</p>\n"

I understand the value of providing support if you have a booth or someone in your organization is presenting.  But I am specifically talking about shows where the company has no real stake like this in the show.

If they can get some new ideas, seeing products of the competitors on the show, then it is also worth it.</p>\n\n<p>If they are going, just to waste time, then it is not worth the money.</p>\n\n<p>Practical trainings can be done any time. Good trade shows are only few times a year.</p>\n",
            " <p>One previous employer would routinely send QA and developers to tradeshows where the company had a booth. One of the difficulties with \"shrinkwrap\" business software is that the folks writing the software don't always know their customers (in this case, accountants and actuaries). So for this company, it was helpful to get the techies out to learn how the users actually used the product. </p>\n",
            " <p>I think it is a question of the complexity of your product. If you have a technically very complex product, non-marketing personell should be usefull as a backup in discussions where the marketing people are out of their depth. </p>\n",
            " <p>Of course there is business value to sending employees to conferences!</p>\n\n<p>This is especially true if someone in your org presents a talk, but even if they go to schmooze with counterparts from other companies and bond with coworkers, it is still worth it and not just for marketing types. <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html\">Java one</a> isn't only marketing, nor is <a href=\"http://velocityconf.com/velocity2012\">Velocity</a>, nor is <a href=\"http://www.eclipsecon.org/2012/\">EclipseCon</a>. These are opportunities for folks to see the state-of-the-art, interact with the top practitioners in their field and become excited about what they're doing by sharing ideas with others.</p>\n\n<p>I can understand why a beancounter (not saying Chad is one) might disagree. It is fashionable in the current economic environment to attempt to calculate an explicit ROI for every expenditure. <strong>The problem is that you just can't compute the business value of an intellectually engaged happy employee who mingles somewhat regularly with a wide range of professionals.</strong> Some people will simply add up the hotel, plane, per-diem, and missing days of work and see a cost-sink. That's not right. </p>\n",
            " <p>One advantage of sending a representative from your technical team to \"buying\" conferences (where you're looking at products others are trying to sell rather than hawking your own wares) that hasn't been mentioned is that they have the opportunity to intercept snap decisions that are occasionally made by executives who attend these shows and fall for the glitz and glamor that typically surround the presentations.  </p>\n\n<p>Having someone close at hand to whisper in their ears can prevent costly mistakes and lost time investigating solutions that would never have been considered if the right questions had been asked at the conference.</p>\n\n<p>I imagine other sections of the business would have similar advantages in their own areas of expertise.</p>\n",
            " <p>I am sure there are more but these are two that I can think of without too much effort:</p>\n\n<p>If you are in industries where the technology changes a lot (e.g. software), you get more value from a good trade show talking to the technicians than attending training classes. </p>\n\n<p>This is mainly because training courses by nature only focus on non cutting edge stuff and you get more done by talking to the developers instead. Shows give you the chance to get in depth information from the horses mouth, which can be invaluable.</p>\n\n<p>Or,</p>\n\n<p>If you are in product development of any sort, you generally get more from trade shows as well. In this day and age, technology know-how is often secondary to having great ideas that can act as differentiators for your company's products.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say you already know how to design cars relatively well. Your time is better served by seeing what the other people are doing at trade shows instead of learning another design skill in a classroom where exposure is limited. </p>\n\n<p>You may not learn how to design faster, or quicker, or in the latest fashionable way at trade shows but what you get is the chance to pick up on new ideas and a head start on  designing the RIGHT product in the first place. </p>\n\n<p>That in itself is infinitely more valuable.</p>\n",
            " <blockquote>\n  <p>However unless you are in marketing I fail to see any value gained by the business in having other workers attend the trade shows.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, <strong>small companies and startups</strong>, fighting for their existence, may need to send non-marketing people to trade shows. Here's why:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A small company should send a <a href=\"http://m.urbandictionary.com/#define?term=smokeshow\">smokeshow</a> to a trade show to stand at the company's booth and attract foot traffic. [In a small company, this person may or may not work in marketing.]</li>\n<li>A small company needs somebody with \"tech credibility\" to attend trade shows to converse with prospective customers, listen to their business problems, and establish the company's product as a solution to their problems. Sometimes a founder, a marketing person, or a salesperson has enough tech credibility to fill these needs, but not always. [This is also why larger companies sometimes hire pre-sales engineers.]</li>\n<li>While I agree that product managers and lead programmers are generally more useful at the workplace, building the product, they too can capture some value at trade shows. When a product manager or lead programmer understands what the marketplace demands, at a deep level, they can exercise superb judgement on requirements decisions. They can gain insight that will help them steer the product in a direction that more closely aligns with what the marketplace demands. </li>\n</ol>\n",
            " <p>I do this on a regular basis.  A trade show is a good place to gain key business insight, however I want my sales and marketing team focussed on - well selling and marketing.</p>\n\n<p>So - when I usually send technical staff along with key, specific briefs that match with their skills and insight. These might be to review the technology of specific key competitors, or what aligned businesses are doing, or look for things that might be a threat to our business model.    </p>\n\n<p>They might not attend the whole show, just a single day, as this helps to maintain focus.</p>\n\n<p>If you combine this with meeting clients and providing technical support if needed to the selling process, its worth doing.  </p>\n\n<p>It can also help them gain appreciation of what the sales and marketing team actually have to do, which can help to break down internal communication barriers in the company.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong> To fully answer, some of this is funded from my training budget, especially for less senior staff where I need to grow their wider understanding of the industry.  This is usually - but not always - where we have identified a specific career development need.   We also send staff to attend technical conferences on a training budget, and I trust them to report back whether it was high value or not.</p>\n",
            " <p>The obvious value of sending employees to trade shows is extracting them from the dreary sweatshop routine of daily work, &amp; letting them relax a bit at company's expense, see new people, places, get new impressions and ideas. It is a perk that should always be distributed around as fairly as the managers can afford.</p>\n\n<p>(To naysayers: this does help in building morale for the company in general).</p>\n",
            " <p>I've found great value in sending employees whose work with customers is primarily over the phone or via email. Our credit department, in particular, has had great success. Instead of being thought of as a faceless collection agency, our credit reps can show them selves to be problem solvers. </p>\n\n<p>Another benefit is that employees who feel chained to their desks really appreciate the chance to spend a day (on the clock) away from the office doing something new and interacting with customers and coworkers in a different light.</p>\n\n<p>I pick and choose quite carefully. Not every show is appropriate for exrta staff.</p>\n"

Add in that if your manager was one of the people who made the call to promote you then your mistakes also reflect on <em>them</em> as well.</p>\n\n<p>To be honest your \"mistake\" wasn't that big a deal in my view - yeah you were out on an estimate by a significant margin but if you're going to be out by such a margin it's far, far better that it's an over estimate than the other way around. Honestly if you'd done the same thing in 6 months time it wouldn't have been anywhere near as big a \"thing\" </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How to handle project manager who is always on fire now?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unfortunately in the absence of a working time machine you can't go back and undo that - so the best thing to do going forward is to be whiter-than-white. Then if after a few weeks of you getting things (particularly estimations) spot-on (well, at least within closer margins - anyone expecting an estimation to be 100% accurate doesn't understand what the word means!) if they are still giving you a hard time over the previous mistake it would be fair to say</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I realize I made a mistake in one of my first estimations but I think I've shown over the last <em>X</em> weeks that it really was a just a blip and that I'm capable of estimating well so can we move on from what is in the past please?</p>\n  \n  <p>I am loosing my interest of work due to this issue ?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't say this to judge but if you're starting to give up this quickly are you sure you <em>want</em> to be in a leadership/managerial role? Like I say it's no judgement on you if you don't, it's not a case of being \"better\" or \"worse\" it's a matter of whether it's suited to you and what's going to give you the best work life for you.</p>\n",

You could also just ask your manager to stop harping on your estimate - an informed guess by definition.</p>\n\n<p>You're allowed to push tactfully back in the workplace.

However, the roles you are in are changed now, whereas as a developer senior or not, your quality is perceived in terms of work done as a team lead your quality is perceived in terms of the work the team does. </p>\n\n<p>Your manager's quality is perceived in terms of the work that all his team leads do.

It would be interesting to see how the work you underestimated actually came out in terms of effort and quality once it was done.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to counter this is with hard facts, look at your teams' estimates and effort, calculate how accurate they are on average. Use that to look at how future estimates are done. So next time your Manager uses this one issue to pressure you you can say that on average estimates come out X% accurate.</p>\n\n<p>Also if your manager is any good, they will know that estimating work is never a science people will use their understanding of the problem and past experience to do a best guess.

Add in that if your manager was one of the people who made the call to promote you then your mistakes also reflect on <em>them</em> as well.</p>\n\n<p>To be honest your \"mistake\" wasn't that big a deal in my view - yeah you were out on an estimate by a significant margin but if you're going to be out by such a margin it's far, far better that it's an over estimate than the other way around. Honestly if you'd done the same thing in 6 months time it wouldn't have been anywhere near as big a \"thing\" </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How to handle project manager who is always on fire now?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unfortunately in the absence of a working time machine you can't go back and undo that - so the best thing to do going forward is to be whiter-than-white. Then if after a few weeks of you getting things (particularly estimations) spot-on (well, at least within closer margins - anyone expecting an estimation to be 100% accurate doesn't understand what the word means!) if they are still giving you a hard time over the previous mistake it would be fair to say</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I realize I made a mistake in one of my first estimations but I think I've shown over the last <em>X</em> weeks that it really was a just a blip and that I'm capable of estimating well so can we move on from what is in the past please?</p>\n  \n  <p>I am loosing my interest of work due to this issue ?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't say this to judge but if you're starting to give up this quickly are you sure you <em>want</em> to be in a leadership/managerial role? Like I say it's no judgement on you if you don't, it's not a case of being \"better\" or \"worse\" it's a matter of whether it's suited to you and what's going to give you the best work life for you.</p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p><strong>Background / current role:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm a software engineer and I've been working almost alone on a project which has an impact on the whole company (big company 10,000+ employees). The project has been resumed after a few years of inactivity with plenty of tech debt. It's extremely hard to do estimations because almost daily I discover something bad which delays me.</p>\n\n<p>Two months ago I asked my manager if somebody else could help me on this project, and my manager assigned another engineer to this project. Then he asked me for estimations and it was estimated that this project would be completed in mid January (with 2.5 people assigned).</p>\n\n<p>In practice this very talented engineer in the last month has managed to work on this project only one week, due to being busy with some other tasks (manager knows about it).</p>\n\n<p><strong>My situation with the temporary internal role:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I just managed to get an informal offer for temporary position in a different department of my company -- the position will last until mid May next year.</p>\n\n<p>Now, when I went to my manager to tell him that I would like to start with the temporary position in the other department he told me that he wants me to finish my project first.</p>\n\n<p>The project isn't going smoothly both for its nature and lack of resources, so I doubt I'm going to complete it by mid January -- as things are now, February or March are a better guess.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>\n\n<p>My manager would like to keep me on this project until it's done. While the temporary position is only until mid May.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if the start date is too late, they might not be interested in me anymore.</p>\n\n<p>If anything goes wrong I'm very tempted to resign, but again the problem is that I would be still stuck in this role for the three months of notice. The relationship is definitely compromised.</p>\n\n<p>I am looking for suggestions on how to proceed in this situation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To Consider:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>My manager does not gain anything from me moving to the temp role;</li>\n<li>I'd like to stay with this company because every few months there are good positions available in other departments.

During the hiring process, I was told that I would have up to 28 vacation days proportionately increase based on the years of service I provide. This was communicated verbally, and I believed what he told me. Upon hired, I signed the offer letter that stated my vacation days \"starts\" with 18 days. Offer letter did not mention anything about the \"cap\". </p>\n\n<p>And a year passed, in 2017 May, I received an email from HR telling me that they forgot sending me an employment contract which I was supposed to read and sign when I was hired in 2016 May.

Other things, he doesn't care at all, and tries to cut every friendly conversation short.</p>\n<p>Soon I grow to realize the seniors just don't bother.

Thus, I'm seeking honest answers to how to properly network with seniors within the company (assume a large organization). I want the 0 to 1 process. But things become very difficult, as seniors judge juniors on the ground of 'what can you do for me?'.</p>\n<p>To simplify things and be very honest, the goal of networking would be for career progression. It exists, no matter how you deny it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: some people ask for rigorous definition of juniority. But as the discussion goes, it is never definite. Despite the terms 'junior' and 'senior' are always implicitly consensed, but for the sake of convenience and rigor, a one sentence assumption to facilitate discussion would be: junior is a relative term, relative to N+2 or up. Though junior is more commonly referred to those with &lt;3 years of work experience. But it would be good to see both cases discussed if possible. The focus here is the rank superiority in general.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

Sure, if the person is 25 years old and single they will come.

It just gets more and more isolated and insular every year.</p>\n<p>So, the bottom line here is that you are more or less wasting your energy if you want to befriend an older, married executive.</p>\n<p>The only real exception is that when there is some organized activity that the executives make time for, like fishing or hunting or something like that. Planned outings. To the extent that such outings exist, that is what you should concentrate on. You may even be able to nudge people in the company into organizing an outing.</p>\n",
            " <p>Unfortunately, you can't force people to network with you if they're more invested in their own social/professional group.</p>\n<p>There's a couple of tactics you can use to increase your visibility.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Simply be friendly - a friendly smile and a &quot;hello&quot; if you meet managers and a bit of small talk lets them get to know you a little without seeming like you're forcing yourself upon them.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Find out what they enjoy doing and parrot that behaviour.  This behaviour is more common in the USA where if you want to get in with a boss who likes golf (for example), you take up golf.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I generally stay friendly with people and every so often I find myself invited to social events.  It does help that my managers are pretty friendly open people too though.</p>\n",
            " <p>Remember that a senior manager's time is valuable, there are many demands on that time, and that unless you work in a small company, they literally do not have time to spend on just getting to know everyone.</p>\n<p>If you want to get on their radar, you need to do so on merit. Assume they will be annoyed if you waste their time, and don't bother them unless they invite input <em>and</em> you have something that is genuinely worth their time and that they are the most appropriate person to contact for.</p>\n<p>Wait for them to create opportunities -- all-hands meetings where they stay afterwards to take informal questions -- or catch them at social events they sponsor or attend where work isn't the primary focus</p>\n<p>Or, if there is an internal discussion system like Slack which they participate in, you may be able to distinguish yourself by being a valued participant there and you may be noticed. Note that I said &quot;valued&quot;, not just visible.</p>\n<p>Or, network with folks nearer your own level, which is generally much easier <em>and</em> more productive.</p>\n",
            " <p>iLuvLogix has a good answer, but missed an opportunity with their approach.</p>\n<p>If you find a common interest outside of work, you will have a better chance of having a real conversation with whomever you are trying to talk to. Generally, this works best if it's a personal interest of theirs, instead of it being work related, but you can (and probably should) start off the conversation on a work related conversation.</p>\n<p>The trick is to not make it seem like a planned speech or some formal elevator pitch. Keep it conversational and if they aren't interested, try again later. Maybe.</p>\n<p>Don't be pushy, just be friendly. Maybe they just don't have time right that second to talk about it, and maybe they'll come back to <em>you</em> about the topic. And maybe they won't.</p>\n<p>And don't be a pest. Talk to them when it seems natural to do so, rather than chasing them down at every opportunity.</p>\n<p>People have a wide variety of responses to social interaction and not all of them are great. If you've seen the original GhostBusters movie, you might remember that Janine tries to spark up a conversation with Egon soon after was she hired, but fails miserably because he doesn't really know how to respond appropriately. There may simply not be a good way to interact with some people without a significant amount of effort, and some of that effort may not be welcome, so definitely pick and choose the appropriate people to try to talk to. This feeds into the last paragraph of iLuvLogix 's answer, which I totally agree with.</p>\n",
            " <p>If you want to socialize, then find social events at work to attend. Does your company have</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Employee events? Things like summer picnic, Christmas party.</li>\n<li>Charity work. There might be a fund raising for a &quot;5k walk for ____&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These kinds of events don't run themselves, and volunteering is a good way to interact with people.</p>\n<p>If you work for a souless kind of corporation, maybe you can lead some small events. A potluck lunch. A fantasy sports league (months worth of small talk right here). A halloween office decoration contest.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>If you want to network, I would search for &quot;problems&quot; to work on(*). This depends on your skillset, and the industry you work in.</p>\n<p>Do you interface with other departments? Are you aware of any direct &quot;friction&quot; that causes inefficency? Perhaps your supervisor isn't so keen on small talk, but maybe topics of a more &quot;corporate&quot; interest are easier to converse on. Ideally, this is more productive than just complaining about something.</p>\n<p>Some companies have small amounts of funds allocated to &quot;business development&quot; or small R&amp;D type projects. Such projects often would benefit from additional help. This is a good way to meet peers with unrelated skills, but also networking with superiors.</p>\n<p>Do you have relevant skills that your peers do not, or more experience in some area? Leading a &quot;lunch and learn&quot; event could be beneficial where you talk about a specific technology.</p>\n<p>Do you have IT/programming skills? I guarantee there are higherups that spend too much time on a simple task that coule be automated by a simple script (beware (*)). Something that helped my current career was working on a problem several senior managers were dealing with.</p>\n<p>Do you have annual performance reviews? Maybe you and your supervisor can define a small (*) extra goal that touches on the above concepts. This also provides justification for further discussion (status repotrs, clarification on goals/requirements, etc).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(*) Budget your time accordingly, probably outside of your normal working hours. Some of these tasks you will be compensated for, some you will not. This may or may not ever pay off. In your situation, perhaps corporate recognition has intrinsic value. Set a personal limit on your &quot;risk tolerance&quot; and how long you are willing to wait for any payoff.</p>\n",
            " <p>The same way you make conversation with anyone else: you find out what their hobbies and interests are and look for overlap with your own. I ran into a senior manager for my company at the airport gate when we were both flying home after a company event. Didn't even <em>know</em> he was a senior manager at my company, but noticed that he had some boat-related paraphernalia, and I like sailing, so I struck up a conversation. Of course during the course of the conversation realized who he was, we talked shop a bit.</p>\n<p>Did I get any tangible benefit? Not immediately. But that wasn't the goal: I was just making the best of the situation I found myself in. Now, at least to that particular individual, my face is not a blank one in a mass of peons, but instead &quot;that guy I met at the airport and talked about sailing and yachts with&quot;. You are almost certainly <strong>not</strong> going to have some &quot;big break&quot; moment where a senior manager &quot;discovers&quot; you and you finally get all the recognition you crave and you feel your talent deserves. You get there by being a competent affable self-promoter who gets **** done and doesn't let anyone forget it.</p>\n<p>It helps to genuinely like people. Or to be a scheming Machiavellian sociopath.

I was working overnights part-time until I was promoted to a full-time position two months ago, doing something different than what I had been doing as a part-timer. I signed a non-compete contract but now I am having regrets as this job hasn't been a good fit at all. I dread going in everyday and I get my work torn apart all the time. I can take constructive criticism but what's happening is beyond that. I bite my tongue because I'm \"new\" but it's just an unhealthy situation.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I had been looking to get into a new line of work for over a year while I was a part-timer but when the full-time opportunity came up, I took it mainly because it was better hours and more money.</p>\n\n<p>Now I'm back to the job search again and I have two interviews set up this week. I'm hopeful that one of these comes through because it would be better for my personal and professional life, but I'm somewhat worried about breaking my contract.</p>\n\n<p>The non-compete clause is specific to the industry and neither of the two jobs I'm interviewing for would qualify. I've also heard of only one instance at my current employer where management thought about suing someone under contract because they were being difficult about wanting to get out of it.</p>\n\n<p>But like I said, it is worrisome when that's being held over you.

            " <p>This is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_continuity_planning#Business_continuity\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>business continuity</em></a> issue. Some of the other answers are focusing on how to approach the idea of working from home for yourself, but that isn't the real problem here.</p>\n\n<p>You say your company is a relatively large organisation, and it has in-house IT (you, and your department). Therefore it will have someone in charge of disaster recovery and business continuity already working on this. They have probably done or are currently doing a risk assessment. So far they haven't determined the risk to the business very high, but that might change.</p>\n\n<p>The overall risk is not only to you, or your coworkers, but to the business (and in the wider sense the overall economy). Let's play this through, from the view of the company.</p>\n\n<p>Assume half the staff gets ill. They don't have to be seriously ill, just unable to work. If 250 of 500 people can't go to work, chances are the company will not produce any products or services in that time. SLAs with customers will not be fulfilled, leading to penalty payments. Customers will leave. If there is production, machines need to be stopped, which is costly (think car factory). All the running costs, in particular salaries and buildings and things like this will still have to be paid, but there is no revenue. That means the company will lose money fast. And with its liquidity it will lose the ability to pay your salary. You will lose your job, and the company will fold. </p>\n\n<p>A recent example <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/05/flybe-collapses-as-covid-19-triggers-fall-in-airline-bookings\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">of this already happening is Flybe</a>, where CoVID-19 has been named as something like the last drop (credibility of this source unclear). </p>\n\n<p>Now what does that mean for you? It's hard to say. The risk assessment isn't your job, but you can take precautions.</p>\n\n<p>No-one will blame you for voicing your concerns in this situation, even if that is not part of your job. If you have already got infrastructure in place to work from home, use it. They are likely not going to question you. In particular if your commute involves busy public transport, there are lots of good arguments to not go to work. The main argumentation is not to keep yourself from getting sick, but from spreading the virus (or other illnesses that someone else might contract in addition to the virus because their immune system is weakened) into the office.</p>\n\n<p>My suggestion is to ask your manager about business continuity plans. Looks at what companies around you are doing. If you have a spouse you live with, has their company sent everyone home? These are good arguments to give them.</p>\n\n<p>Your company's business continuity team might be well prepared and currently executing risk mitigation, or it might not. In either case, they will appreciate that some people are aware and conscious of the situation.</p>\n"

I signed the job offer but told the employer verbally that the expected start date I will write on the offer is just estimated initially based on what I have read on the company\u2019s policy (I can join them one month later) and once I hand in my resignation I will know more. (i.e. if my boss needs me for handover or something).</p>\n\n<p>This Thursday I told my direct manager that I will not renew my contract and he told me that he needs me for two months (so that is one month more than I have calculated initially) so I can help in finding a replacement, train them, handover all my current projects to them. And he told me that the period might be one month only depending on how fast we find a replacement and when can they join.</p>\n\n<p>Right now I am kind of embarrassed to talk to my future employer and tell them that I might join them later. I feel like it was my mistake was that I signed the job offer and gave them an expected start date before talking to my manager.\nWhat is the right approach to handle this?\nShould I negotiate with my current manager on the notice period?\nShould I just be honest to my future employer about the hand over?

Due to the pandemic, I will have to not only learn all this, but also to do it 100% or partly remotely.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have any tips in how to sucessfuly integrate myself in a team and in a company without physically being present in the office?

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Several times in my career, I've encountered situations where the business has a technical problem, and I have the previous experience and skills necessary to resolve the issue.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of being trusted to solve the issue, these companies have typically hired (expensive) external consultants to come in and \"save us\". Their theory being \"they're paid to work in that area, so they must be experts\"...</p>\n\n<p>In each case, I've already presented my understanding of the problem and my proposed solution. Each and every time, the consultants produce a report that supports my conclusions (but often goes into less detail - as I've had the advantage of examining the original issue over more time).</p>\n\n<p>Then, what usually happens is that I've gained some \"business credibility\" in subject \"A\", but if a problem ever occurs with topic \"B\" it'll be the same uphill battle all over again.</p>\n\n<p>I've also seen attitudes resembling:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"We don't know, so you can't know.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If they've had an issue for months or years, then you join and suggest something they haven't tried, there's almost a willful refusal to consider the possibility.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The consultants are employed by the vendor/OEM, so they must know.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even when it's a relatively trivial issue, they'll assume they need an oracle on the subject (thinking along the lines of \"we have a Java issue, James Gosling must be the only person able to help us\").</p>\n\n<p>Now, I'd hope that I have a reasonably realistic assessment of my own abilities (or lack thereof), so when there's a problem outside of my \"domain\" I'll just do everything possible to stay out of the way and absorb the knowledge demonstrated by whoever gets tasked with resolving it (basically, I don't pretend to know what I don't know about). </p>\n\n<p><strong>How can I convince my employer that I have the level of competence they require when it's in an area where they lack the expertise to assess competence?</strong> </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>A few people commenting and answering have missed a nuance to my question. The people I'm working with are not incompetent in general (quite the opposite in fact), they simply lack competence <strong>for a given skill</strong> - usually on a rare topic.</p>\n\n<p>This means I do not patronize, talk down to them or speak to them with any disdain or disrespect (as some answerers have assumed). In fact, when the topic is in an area they have a degree of familiarity with, I find it very easy to get \"buy-in\" and support for my ideas. The only time I encounter any issues is when they lack the tools to assess my competence in a skill they lack themselves.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>The best way to prevent the race for a consultant is present a convincing business case that doesn't include a consultant.  From the business cases I've developed the main points are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Thoroughly define the problem being solved - Do not include your solution within the problem definition.  Concisely state the problem in business terms rather than technical terms.  For example \"Based on submitted bug reports customers find feature X confusing.  This confusion leads to frustration and reduces engagement in the overall product.\" is much better than \"The UI of feature X is flawed in these ways...\" because it states the problem in terms of business value.  In terms of solution ownership this shows that you understand the issue from a business perspective which is key since this is the same perspective that the decision makers will be looking from.  This will get everyone on the same page as to what the problem is from a high level.</li>\n<li>State your solution along with several other possible plans of\naction including the null case of doing nothing and state the\ncosts/benefits for each. For the above example I would go through\ndoing nothing, scrapping feature X, improving user training/help\ndocuments, reworking the UI on feature X.  This shows that you have\nlooked at the issue from several sides rather than immediately\nhopping onto your pet solution to the exclusion of all others.</li>\n<li>Show how you can effectively test if your solution eliminates the\nproblem.  This is huge in selling non-technical people on technical\nsolutions.  They want assurance that their investment is working so\nif you can give them concrete parameters and a way to measure\nsuccess.  If the definition of success is murky it is\npsychologically much harder to buy in to an idea.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My best real world example regarding going to a consultant is imagine you go to a mechanic for routine inspection.  If you hear \"Your garbles are cracked.  It's $800 to change them out.  Should I go ahead with that?\"  you are not going to be very confident in your ability to know if your money is being well spent and you may get a second opinion.  If you hear \"Your garbles are slightly cracked which could lead to your steering failing if you hit a pothole.  We could wait and see but that's risky.  I could weld across the crack for $500 but I wouldn't trust it long run.  It would be $800 to swap them out.  Swapping them out is the only way we can be sure they will hold.  What do you want me to do?\" you are going to feel more empowered to make a good decision even if the ultimate decision is the same.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note in a lot of places you are going to be fighting the culture to make headway on this.  Don't take it personally if the default answer is consultancy, just continue to work on your sales skills for selling your ideas to management.  When a decision goes against you on this remember that you may be missing pieces of the bigger picture (ie cost of failure may be higher than it generally appears due to interdependencies) or the opportunity cost for you doing this project rather than something else might be too high.</p>\n",
            " <p>I've seen the same type of issue in my own past.  As noted by Myles part of the issue might be a communication problem. Often, people will not necessarily understand a technical person's description of a problem or the appropriate solution. Graphs, pictures and external supporting references sometimes confer some comfort to the reader.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of your communication skills I suggest there is a very difficult to overcome reason for such behavior as a company grows. Higher level people who are making decisions often abhor making a decision that they can be held directly accountable for. If they take a risk on a solution you propose and it doesn't work out they either stumble themselves or a strong internal resource stumbles.</p>\n\n<p>Neither is acceptable to some people.</p>\n\n<p>When a brand name consultant comes along, which of course appears to represent expertise, which at times is simply not any more advanced than internal resources, there is a nice convenient place to put the blame. I went with what the consultants proposed and so did the rest of the stakeholders involved. It came in a flashy document with loads of details which must mean it was correct.</p>\n\n<p>So, yes, if there's a problem we fire the consultant. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not a fan of this but I have seen the reins handed over to bumbling consulting and development groups too many times to discount this effect. Now, there are other good reasons, such as not having the time and resources to tackle the issue internally -- or quite simply not having a large enough team with solid skills in the area being considered even though one or two folks may.</p>\n\n<p>My viewpoint may be peppered with a touch of jaded... ;)</p>\n",
            " <p>I wonder why you oppose bringing in consultants if the end results is that something gets implemented that is just what you would have suggested, especially when afterwards everyone agrees that you totally did know what the right course of action was. Is it that you would have liked to get recognition in advance that your idea was right? Is it that you think the company is wasting money paying consultants for advice they could have had for free?</p>\n\n<p>Those external consultants (and yes, quite often I am one of them) bring a lot more into the group than the idea of what to do to get your problem solved. They bring external authority and expertise, which often sways other participants into changing their ways, far more so than a logical explanation of why a particular course of action is right. They bring a convenient scapegoat also - if someone changes how they do things because a colleague or peer said to, and it goes bad, the blame will be on the changer, but if someone changes how they do things because a highly paid external consultant said to, and it goes bad, the blame will be on the consultant. They also demonstrate, by the sheer money that is being spent on them, that management is truly committed to making this change.</p>\n\n<p>I can't tell you how many times someone has told me \"that recommendation you made today, that they've all agreed to and are starting to do? I argued for that a month ago and nobody would listen.\" I reassure them that this is a widespread phenomenon that <strong>does not</strong> (and here's where I start to actually answer your question) <strong>reflect management's actual opinion of their skill level.</strong> Let me say that again. The reason people don't take your advice, and then later take that very same advice from a paid external consultant, is <strong>not</strong> because they think you are less skilled than you are or your advice is less valuable than it is. </p>\n\n<p>Go ahead and put a little effort into showing you can solve it yourself. If they don't listen (and they probably won't) make sure you get a chance to work closely with the consultants. You can tell them what you know, which will improve the quality of the solution, you may (or may not) learn from them, and when the project succeeds you will be associated with the success. Don't get worked up about the possibility that silly old management is incapable of understanding how good you are or how simple their technical problems are. You may be right, but often there is more to a technical problem than a technical solution.</p>\n",
            " <p>My problem with the question is that it assumes the person who made the choice to hire a consultant is incompetent.  I do not think the Dunning-Kruger failure effect is the real or only reason why you are not successful in your attempts to convince people not to use consultants when you have the available skills. And really what do you gain by assuming that other people are falling into the Dunning-Kruger effect? Does this help you be effective at work in any way?  Why are you even thinking about it? It actually prevents you from seeing what you can do to improve the situation if you are stuck on the idea that other people are incompetent.</p>\n\n<p>First, if your attitude is that they just don't get me and recognize how wonderful I am, then people will pick up that you resent them and be less likely to consult you. So stop even thinking about Dunning-Kruger because it is irrelevant to getting the job done. Your post came across as pretty negative about your managers' incompetence. If I thought that, then there is a good chance that they do too. </p>\n\n<p>Next, there are so many reasons to hire consultants over your own employees to solve problems that have nothing to do with what they think of you. </p>\n\n<p>First you may be highly thought of and they don't think they can spare the time from your regular duties for you to do this.</p>\n\n<p>Second, you may not be presenting your ideas in a way that they understand. Technical people tend to focus on the technical, managers tend to focus on the business need. You have to be talking their language.</p>\n\n<p>Third they may have money in the budget they need to spend or they won't get it next year.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, they may agree with your solution but know it is an easier sell to senior management if it comes from an outside source. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to contribute to change at your organization, you need to first start helping the consultants. It will be noticed that you have contributed if you do this.  Pay attention to how they present the results versus how you did it. Learn how to present ideas like a successful consultant.  </p>\n\n<p>Next don't assume that the people making the decisions are even aware of your skills. Likely anyone beyond your immediate boss doesn't know you already have the skills they are looking for. I've even had bosses who did not know my background if they were not the person who originally hired me and the task was outside the normal duties I did for them. (But if I wanted them to use those skills, I made sure to make sure they knew.) You need to become visible to the higher levels of the organization, see this question for more on this subject:\n<a href=\"https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/11816/why-is-it-important-to-gain-visibility-in-the-workplace\">Why is it important to gain &quot;visibility&quot; in the workplace?</a> </p>\n\n<p>You should welcome the consultants because every time they make the same recommendation you did, then your credibility is increased.</p>\n",
            " <p>Serious problems rarely have one solution nor are they always solved to a specific degree. There is some gray area. Like all engineers, you want to solve problems (which is good), but managers also have to factor in risk.</p>\n\n<p>Consultants can mitigate risk:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>They were highly recommended (i.e. it's not my fault if they screw up)</li>\n<li>They can be contractually held to providing solutions or payment can be withheld where as employees just get fired.</li>\n<li>Consultants can have access to other types of expertise if something unexpected comes up.</li>\n<li>Current Staff may have expertise, but not the time to implement a solution.</li>\n<li>Some managers have previous experience with a particular consultant, so they feel more comfortable with that person. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(Per update to the question) It is safe to assume that people who lack knowledge in an area struggle to identify those who can. It seems like you're able to put together a detailed proposal, but management may be more comfortable if you just get to the point.</p>\n",
            " <p>The empirical evidence says that when you know a good solution you are unable to build group consensus that it is the best way forward. Unless you consistently work for, and with, incompetent people, then the balance of probabilities is that the problem is in your soft skills, specifically with consensus building. This may be a case of Dunning-Kruger but where you are over-estimating your skills in the area of teamwork, consensus building, and stakeholder management. </p>\n\n<p>You state that \"instead of being trusted to solve the issue\" they hire in a consultant. No-one is infallible so taking something on trust is taking a risk. If there is significant potential downside it would be irrational not to minimise risk. It is trivial to eliminate the risk of taking what you say on trust; get a consultant in for a second opinion. A lack of \"soft skills\" and an over focus on the technical aspects of problem solving may be driving them into hiring consultants. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=EQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">high EQ</a> approach is:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Don't bring <em>your</em> solution to the group; bring the group to <em>their</em> solution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Parachuting a solution into a group of stakeholders always risks rejection. People will not have thought through all the avenues you have thought through. They cannot feel comfortable that all the possible alternatives are inferior. The high EQ approach is to talk the solution space over with some key stakeholders one-to-one in advance of any group meetings. This refines your argument and builds support for your recommendations. Go over some possible approaches you have rejected asking whether your rejection reasoning is sound. Then present your favoured solution asking if you have missed any angles, risks or issues. Finally ask them if they can think of any good alternative approaches. Repeat this with a few stakeholders one-to-one until you are sure you have all the angles covered and have perfected your pitch. </p>\n\n<p>Only then hold a group meeting with all stakeholders and take the same approach; go through the alternatives which have been rejected and why. Then pitch your favoured solution and perhaps an alternative someone else has come up with to show you are being open minded and balanced. </p>\n\n<p>Taking such a consensus building approach works for many reasons: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>People feel you have listened and have a fully rounded perspective on all risk and issues.  </li>\n<li>People understand the alternative ideas you have considered and why\nthey are rejected.</li>\n<li>You learn new things about risks and issues of alternative solutions.</li>\n<li>You learn which risks and issues stakeholders are more or less concerned about.   </li>\n<li>Some people you have consulted feel vested in your preferred solution because you have taken time to go over it with them.  </li>\n<li>Some people get more time to consider your solution on two encounters; once when you go over it with them directly and a second time when you bring it to the wider group. If your solution is superior to the alternatives they are likely to be convinced that it is the best way forward. </li>\n<li>You can present the solution as being a group solution by saying things like \"Mary pointed out that X could go wrong which we can cover by doing Y\". </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=EQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Googling \"EQ\"</a> brings up: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For most people, emotional intelligence (EQ) is more important than\n  one's intelligence (IQ) in attaining success in their lives and\n  careers. As individuals our success and the success of the profession\n  today depend on our ability to read other people's signals and react\n  appropriately to them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You should read that people are not persuaded by your approach and are unwilling to simply trust you. The appropriate reaction is to engage with people, learn their concerns, help them to refine the solution, and pitch the solution as owned by the team, not by you. </p>\n",
            " <p>I think you might be missing another aspect of the cost-benefit equation here.</p>\n\n<p>There are quite a few reasons to hire consultants, and one of those is to simply allow for the internal staff to be able to focus on the day to day running of the environment.<br>\nI've come into quite a few shops where the staff knew what the problem was, and had a pretty good idea of the cause or even a solution already planned.</p>\n\n<p>Going into these environments, my main impression is usually that I'm being asked for a plan not because they don't have one, but because <em>they want to compare it with the plan already provided by their internal staff to gauge my competence</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The internal staff is usually required for day to day workings, and are the first stop whenever a problem occurs. While the issue I'm brought in to fix is something that, while often time consuming, is not a recurring action. And as such can easily be handled by an external asset who can be safely let go once the job is done.</p>\n\n<p>Have you actually asked your boss(es) why they prefer hiring consultants for these issues in stead of going with your recommendations?<br>\nIf they are competent managers, the answer might surprise you, and have less to do with their perceived competence of your skills than you think.</p>\n",
            " <p>Catalogue all the times this has happened, get estimates for how much was spent on consultants to come up with solutions (as opposed to implementing them), then go as high as you can in the organisation and ask for a pay raise.</p>\n\n<p>The obvious rule of thumb being used here is \"more expense = more excellence\". If they're paying you more, they'll take you more seriously.</p>\n"

        "sft_target": " <p>The best way to prevent the race for a consultant is present a convincing business case that doesn't include a consultant.  From the business cases I've developed the main points are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Thoroughly define the problem being solved - Do not include your solution within the problem definition.  Concisely state the problem in business terms rather than technical terms.  For example \"Based on submitted bug reports customers find feature X confusing.  This confusion leads to frustration and reduces engagement in the overall product.\" is much better than \"The UI of feature X is flawed in these ways...\" because it states the problem in terms of business value.  In terms of solution ownership this shows that you understand the issue from a business perspective which is key since this is the same perspective that the decision makers will be looking from.  This will get everyone on the same page as to what the problem is from a high level.</li>\n<li>State your solution along with several other possible plans of\naction including the null case of doing nothing and state the\ncosts/benefits for each. For the above example I would go through\ndoing nothing, scrapping feature X, improving user training/help\ndocuments, reworking the UI on feature X.  This shows that you have\nlooked at the issue from several sides rather than immediately\nhopping onto your pet solution to the exclusion of all others.</li>\n<li>Show how you can effectively test if your solution eliminates the\nproblem.  This is huge in selling non-technical people on technical\nsolutions.  They want assurance that their investment is working so\nif you can give them concrete parameters and a way to measure\nsuccess.  If the definition of success is murky it is\npsychologically much harder to buy in to an idea.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My best real world example regarding going to a consultant is imagine you go to a mechanic for routine inspection.  If you hear \"Your garbles are cracked.  It's $800 to change them out.  Should I go ahead with that?\"  you are not going to be very confident in your ability to know if your money is being well spent and you may get a second opinion.  If you hear \"Your garbles are slightly cracked which could lead to your steering failing if you hit a pothole.  We could wait and see but that's risky.  I could weld across the crack for $500 but I wouldn't trust it long run.  It would be $800 to swap them out.  Swapping them out is the only way we can be sure they will hold.  What do you want me to do?\" you are going to feel more empowered to make a good decision even if the ultimate decision is the same.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note in a lot of places you are going to be fighting the culture to make headway on this.  Don't take it personally if the default answer is consultancy, just continue to work on your sales skills for selling your ideas to management.  When a decision goes against you on this remember that you may be missing pieces of the bigger picture (ie cost of failure may be higher than it generally appears due to interdependencies) or the opportunity cost for you doing this project rather than something else might be too high.</p>\n",
        "rejected_target": " <p>I've seen the same type of issue in my own past.  As noted by Myles part of the issue might be a communication problem. Often, people will not necessarily understand a technical person's description of a problem or the appropriate solution. Graphs, pictures and external supporting references sometimes confer some comfort to the reader.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of your communication skills I suggest there is a very difficult to overcome reason for such behavior as a company grows. Higher level people who are making decisions often abhor making a decision that they can be held directly accountable for. If they take a risk on a solution you propose and it doesn't work out they either stumble themselves or a strong internal resource stumbles.</p>\n\n<p>Neither is acceptable to some people.</p>\n\n<p>When a brand name consultant comes along, which of course appears to represent expertise, which at times is simply not any more advanced than internal resources, there is a nice convenient place to put the blame. I went with what the consultants proposed and so did the rest of the stakeholders involved. It came in a flashy document with loads of details which must mean it was correct.</p>\n\n<p>So, yes, if there's a problem we fire the consultant. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not a fan of this but I have seen the reins handed over to bumbling consulting and development groups too many times to discount this effect. Now, there are other good reasons, such as not having the time and resources to tackle the issue internally -- or quite simply not having a large enough team with solid skills in the area being considered even though one or two folks may.</p>\n\n<p>My viewpoint may be peppered with a touch of jaded... ;)</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <h2>First, a little bit of background:</h2>\n\n<p>I've been in this company for a little over 2 years. We were a small team of 3 people managing and developing the tools for our companies (we are the HQ). Almost 5 months ago, one of our colleagues left and since then I am having an increased number of tasks. Over these 2 years I have learned a lot and now I'm faster and more efficient at completing tasks and am able to tackle more complex matters too.</p>\n\n<h2>Salary history</h2>\n\n<p>This job was advertised as \"the minimum salary for this job is xx$\". And since before this job I've done a one year internship and it was the first \"real\" job plus the fact that it was matching perfectly with what I've done for one year and it also was what I wanted to continue with, I didn't try to negotiate this minimum offered salary out of fear of not getting the job. Fast forward 1 year later, I was waiting for the first employee appraisal in the hopes that I will be able to get a salary increase. Unfortunately, the management decided they want to change the direction in which the company is going and my boss was let go. Shortly after, we got a new boss and nobody had his appraisal that year from the department. Waited almost another year for the next appraisal, for which I have asked multiple times, over a time span of 2 months, and finally had the meeting and at the end of the meeting finally asked for a raise.</p>\n\n<p>Off-topic: The raise mentioned above is quite big in %, almost 30% but considering that even with that raise for my current experience I will be on par with the job market or even lower. I am not justifying my asked increase based on the fact that I've been doing this for over 2 years, but based on the market and what they would need to spend to replace me. I'd like to point out that I received a positive feedback in the appraisal and was told to keep up the good work.</p>\n\n<h2>Back to the salary negotiation</h2>\n\n<p>I didn't get a no from my boss for my asked raise, just that he needs to talk to HR. I was pretty happy back then because I thought that even if in the event in which I wasn't to going to get exactly what I asked for, I would be happy with even a slightly lower increase (20-25%). Now 3 months and a half passed and I have asked 4 times about the status of my request and stating that this is important to me not only due to the financial part but this would reflect how the company values me. Every time, I get more or less the same answer: still waiting for an answer from HR (my boss has a very important position in the company and probably he is not being honest as this salary increase should be very well in his power).</p>\n\n<h2>Notes:</h2>\n\n<p>This question is not about the %. As mentioned before, I didn't get a \"no\" for one second or a remark that it's too much.</p>\n\n<p>I love working here and I have spend a lot of time to learn the specifics of this company, I would like to do everything in my power to avoid leaving.</p>\n\n<p>The company is looking for months for someone to replace the colleague who left and they haven't been able to do it so far (mostly because with the set of skills asked, those people are already working as consultants and earning more). Note: the colleague which left the company, left for the same reason: asked for a raise and he got a \"no\". But at least he got an answer pretty fast...</p>\n\n<h2>Question</h2>\n\n<p>How should I continue from here? Should I try to be more pushy and ask again if he's (boss) happy with my performance and if the answer is \"yes\" then go ahead and ask firmly to have my situation finalized. Is it normal that it takes this long for an answer, or this would show a complete lack of interest for the employee? My goal is to at least get a \"no\" or a \"yes\", tired of waiting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Probably not a duplicate of \"How to approach my boss if I'm feeling underpaid\". I have already read that even before I had my first negotiation and followed the advices there to discus about my achievements and why I should I be getting a raise. Now it's a matter of done that and <strong>now what</strong>?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit nr. 2</strong>: Since I can't add a comment to Joe's answer due to the low reputation, I'll type additional info here. First of all, thank you Joe, long time reader of your answers here. My boss talked to HR for sure at least once, because there was also the discussion if they should change my contract type to have more hours included, to that HR sent back quite fast a \"no\" because I am not above a certain trigger that they are having. I know that they can't afford losing another team member because due to the specifics of the job, it takes 6 months to 1 year to get familiarized with all the custom tools and how they are built (can be faster for a fast learner). Now, I don't know why would HR drag this, the only reason I could think of, is they are first looking for a replacement for my colleague and once they have that they will say \"no\" to me.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I tried to interview with two different companies in Japan, but they always want use Skype for interviews and refuse use other software/methods (like telephone interview).

Japan</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I cancelled the interview because I can't find an internet cafe with Skype.</p>\n\n<p>Does this mean they're not a good company, inflexible and with bad management?</p>\n\n<p>I forgot: the company's job adertisement did not say that the company only uses Skype for interviews.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <blockquote>\n  <p>Is my guess correct?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>No.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The requirement to use Skype doesn't imply a bad company, inflexibility, or bad management. It's likely just a nod to the ubiquity of Skype these days.</p>\n\n<p>You can obviously decide not to work there, but you'll be limiting your base of potential employers a lot. Skype is pretty standard fare. </p>\n\n<p>You would be better served to borrow a computer with Skype already installed, assuming you don't already own a computer. Or as @QuaestorLucem wisely suggests, use your smartphone if you own one.</p>\n",
            " <p>Our company exclusively uses Google hangouts for interviews. We are absolutely a flexible company. However, that is our video chat software so it's what we use.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to look at this question is the employer perspective:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There is a candidate that insists we use their own video software for the interview, are they likely to be a high maintenance employee who needs special things?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It also looks like you can use <a href=\"https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34665/try-skype-without-a-skype-account-on-skype-com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Skype for web</a>, too, so you could do that without installing anything, which seems like it would work for your purposes. Create a throwaway account for the interview, use the online interface, and that's all you'd have to do.</p>\n",
            " <p>I am actually working in Japan, and I can tell you that <strong>I am not surprised by their answer.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>It does not tell that it's a bad company, but only a real Japanese company</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>At work (and not only) they are totally inflexible with policies and rules, even if that sounds stupid for you. The good point is that nobody will never address you any reproaches for doing stupid things if the policies or the rules enforced it.\nAnother good point is that if the the rule is smart or/and useful, even people that doesn't understand it will stick to it.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to work with Japanese people or in Japan, you should start changing a bit, and accept that sometimes you'll have to do stupid things because your boss or your client told you so.</p>\n",
            " <p>Consider the company's point of view. What if every job candidate had different preferred software? Now they have to install dozens of different software packages and learn to use them. That would be a giant administrative pain.</p>\n\n<p>And think about what it says about you as a potential employee if you refuse to use the company's preferred software. Suppose you get the job. Are you going to refuse to use the company email system and insist on using your own? Are you going to refuse to write company documents in Word and insist on using Open Office? Are you going to refuse to write your programs in C# and insist on using VB? Are you going to demand that they buy you a special chair and use your preferred brand of coffee maker in the break room? Etc.</p>\n\n<p>There are big advantages to a company if everybody is using the same tools. Sure, there are times when there is good reason to break the pattern and do something different. If a company says \"We always use Microsoft products. You say that in this case where there are overwhelming advantages to using a non-Microsoft project? No, you don't understand, let me explain again. We always use Microsoft products.\", sure, that's foolish and narrow-minded and inflexible. </p>\n\n<p>But it is perfectly reasonable to say, \"We conduct all our tele-meetings with Skype so that our people only need to install one telemeeting product on their computers, and anyone who has that software installed can participate in any meeting. We don't doubt that other products may have advantages, but those advantages are not enough to outweigh the convenience of everyone using the same standard product.\"</p>\n",
            " <p>\"Skype is spyware\": Citation needed.</p>\n\n<p>Fact of the matter is, Skype is simply the most stable videoconferencing product out there.  I once had an interview with a company who asked me to use a lesser-known one (Zoom or something?), and I spent the first 15 minutes trying to set it up after being told that a Linux client existed when it was highly unstable and wouldn't even load on my computer.  Subsequently we tried using Google Hangouts, which connected but the communication was very unstable, so we ended up just using Skype in the end.  I passed the interview anyway, but it would have been much smoother on both sides if we had just used Skype to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>As for why no telephone interview, I'm not exactly sure; what I do know is that many Japanese companies have an obsession with video conferencing.  Perhaps it's because \"we're a tech company we shouldn't use telephones\" or something, I don't know.  But I've never had a phone interview with a Japanese company.  In any case, Skype is much cheaper to use than a long-distance phone call, so that could be a reason too.</p>\n\n<p>Just install Skype and use it.  Uninstall it later if you don't like it, or use a throwaway account, or whatever.</p>\n",
            " <p><strong>TLDR: It's not indicating bad management, but it might mean they are not a good fit for you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It's not a bad company. And Skype is not considered spyware. \nSadly a decent amount of user tracking and convenience over anonymity / user liberty/ security / data protection is the norm these days.</p>\n\n<p>They have their company solution to do interview (and other calls) and they follow that. I'd find it a bit inflexible to not fall back to a normal telephone conversation, but that they are not too keen on installing other software is totally normal. Some companies where individual employees have a lot of individual responsibility and freedom might accept that, but I would not expect that you can dictate to any company how the interview is done.</p>\n\n<p>Now what does it say about the company? It's probably decently large. The larger a company gets the more it tends to follow policies / company wide solutions to standard problems and adhere to them. There are exceptions where individuals / individual departments have large freedoms, but this seems to be a company that has a tight organisation - at least if the HR department is indicative of the rest of the company.</p>\n\n<p>So while it's not ultimately bad, it might just not be an environment where you would want to work. If you prefer flexibility, individual decisions and or a focus on data protection / user empowerment / open source software, then this could indicate that this is not the right company for you. However, sometimes different departments in the same company are run totally different. While the HR department might have strict rules and use mass market software, other departments might be run different. E.g. in many companies the default operating system is Windows (along with central administration), but people in certain departments are allowed to install their own OS on their work machine and manage their machine themselves (but don't get the same support in maintaining it). Whether this is the case, you won't find out if you don't get an interview.</p>\n\n<p>But if you have enough other options, then this can be a quick filter that sorts out companies you likely don't fit with anyway.</p>\n\n<p><em>Options to manage the problem as good as possible</em>: As many companies do use Skype for their remote interview calls, you might want to try and get past that step to see if they are generally a bad fit or whether this is the only thing you don't like while minimising the \"impact\" on you. I'm assuming here that you either don't want to install Skype on your machine, as you consider it spyware, and/or that you don't want to identify yourself towards Microsoft when using Skype. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ask to use normal telephone instead (in this case you tried and did not succeed, but still this, is relatively likely an option,at least compared to suggesting other software based options) </li>\n<li>Use web-skype, that way you avoid an installation of something you consider spyware, you still require an account though</li>\n<li>If you feel really paranoid about it, you might also use a Linux distribution on a USB stick to boot into that instead of your normal OS and either install Skype there or use web skype from that system</li>\n<li>if you want to avoid providing your real phone number when creating a throwaway account, you can try to use an online service that allows you to read sms to mobile numbers provided by them online (google for concrete services); however, those numbers are often black-listed by big companies soon after they go online it seems. So you might have to try a few times till you manage to open an account with one of them. And you run the risk that it is shut-down by Skype should they find out afterwards (no idea what their policy is regarding the usage of such phone numbers). You might want to make sure that is not illegal where you live depending on how harsh your government looks at attempts to stay anonymous.</li>\n<li>buy a cheap/used phone with a prepaid sim card, install Skype there and use it only for your interviews, then get rid of both (or re-install the system on the phone), same option applies to a laptop</li>\n<li>ask in an internet cafe if they can install Skype for you; even if they don't have it on there as a default, they might be fine with installing it. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Personal Opinion</em>: To me it's funny that Skype is now adapted all over the place in corporations when it stopped being the leading solution that works without problems cross-platform quite a while ago. Due to that one might see a fixation on Skype as a (tiny) indicator of a company trying to catch up with the times, but still quite a bit behind. But I personally wouldn't use that as a sole discriminator to go ahead or not with an interview process.</p>\n",
            " <p>I wouldn't consider a company based on their use of Skype, unless it's an actual HR interviews company and does only that.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that Japanese culture tends to be very formal and ritualistic, with all the pros and cons, even in following procedures and rules in ways that you may want to change but will never be able to as much as you try.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason is that their HR department may be using the paid version of Skype for Business that can, among other things, let them record interviews and interact with Calendar applications. If this were the case you do see that asking them to use another service is just something they cannot do since they could be \"bound\" to be using it. \nI do not know if they record or not. Generally they should tell you if they do but I know little or nothing about Japanese laws.</p>\n\n<p>And if you worry about using Skype because of \"governments\" I would simply remind you that if your CV is on the web or LinkedIn there is nothing to worry about an interview where you say what you already said online about you. It's a job interview and when you look for a job you want people to know what you do. </p>\n"

It's likely just a nod to the ubiquity of Skype these days.</p>\n\n<p>You can obviously decide not to work there, but you'll be limiting your base of potential employers a lot. Skype is pretty standard fare. </p>\n\n<p>You would be better served to borrow a computer with Skype already installed, assuming you don't already own a computer. Or as @QuaestorLucem wisely suggests, use your smartphone if you own one.</p>\n",
        "rejected_target": " <p>I wouldn't consider a company based on their use of Skype, unless it's an actual HR interviews company and does only that.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that Japanese culture tends to be very formal and ritualistic, with all the pros and cons, even in following procedures and rules in ways that you may want to change but will never be able to as much as you try.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason is that their HR department may be using the paid version of Skype for Business that can, among other things, let them record interviews and interact with Calendar applications. If this were the case you do see that asking them to use another service is just something they cannot do since they could be \"bound\" to be using it. \nI do not know if they record or not. Generally they should tell you if they do but I know little or nothing about Japanese laws.</p>\n\n<p>And if you worry about using Skype because of \"governments\" I would simply remind you that if your CV is on the web or LinkedIn there is nothing to worry about an interview where you say what you already said online about you. It's a job interview and when you look for a job you want people to know what you do. </p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I'm currently a 24 yr old contract-to-hire developer at this company. I'm five months in to a six month contract. My job title is \"Developer.\" No prefix. I'm between Junior/Entry-Level and Senior. I'm on a team with two senior developers, one of which is driving me insane.</p>\n\n<p>He constantly talks down to me like I don't know what I'm doing. It's one thing if he's helping me with a process that's unique to how the company's data or services are structured, but he is always telling me the most fundamental tips about programming that are not company specific. He's telling me how to be a developer as if I've never programed before. This is not just simple hazing or \"new guy\" kind of talking. My impression is that he honestly seems to think I can't do my job. I will say on his behalf that he doesn't say it with a demeaning tone or with any kind of annoyance. I think he does mean well.</p>\n\n<p>I know I'm young, but I do have a lot of experience including seven years of work experience and a few first and second place awards on the national level. I feel insulted by his comments.</p>\n\n<p>This is the best paying job I've ever had and I moved across the country to work here. He is a strong reason for why I'm thinking of throwing all that away and not staying with the company when the contract is up.</p>\n\n<p>It's been five months and I've done plenty of good work. I'm running out of ways to show him that I don't want to be treated this way. How can I get the point across to him while keeping it professional? Or, perhaps, how can I keep my sanity and feeling of self worth if he continues?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: He is not my boss or team lead. We work on the same level in the team.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>How likely do you think it is for you to find other people like this in other workplaces? Seriously ponder this question for a moment as the guy may be technically skilled but not great at dealing with people which may be something you'll encounter in fields like IT where specialized skills can be sought and others find ways to work with difficult people that may be more than a bit eccentric at times.</p>\n\n<p>The conversation I suggest you have with him is about your background and that the tips he points out aren't needed. In a way this is more about how you are being treated as perhaps he doesn't know how much this agitates you. While I can see in your post you are more than a little rattled, I wonder how well is he supposed to know this? Avoidance just keeps the same cycle going as he may think this is useful and just keep at it. After all, what are you telling him that should lead him to think otherwise?</p>\n\n<p>Before the conversation be sure to have a few examples of what was pointed so that you can reference examples and possibly see if you could brainstorm solutions to this as I doubt this will be the only time you come across this kind of co-worker.</p>\n",
            " <p>Do you learn from this guy?</p>\n\n<p>I have been in a similar situation, being talked down to etc, but the individual also taught me a lot, albeit in a condescending way.</p>\n\n<p>I rejected this person at the time as I felt that they were targeting me specifically. I only saw the negative and I wish I could go back and let them know that I have changed my view, but some people, especially in IT, aren't the most people friendly, and learning how to work with those people is a skill in itself which can be rewarding too as there is often a lot to learn from them.</p>\n\n<p>My point is that if you find that you do learn and improve as a result of this person, who it sounds like is taking a special interest in you, then it might be an idea to learn to cope with their personality and use this as an opportunity to become a better developer.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, when somebody sees potential in somebody else and they know that the person could do better, they express this in less than ideal ways.</p>\n\n<p>If not, then maybe start looking for another job.</p>\n",
            " <p>\"How can I get the point across to him while keeping it professional?\"</p>\n\n<p>Does he tell you the same things over and over,  indicating that he isn't paying attention to what you are saying?  A gentle reminder might be in order (gravely nod and say \"yes, I remember you telling me that yesterday.\") and fast forward him to what you need to learn(...and what I'd really like to know is...\")</p>\n\n<p>Or is he covering new ground, just things you already know?  If this is the case, just nod and wait until he takes a breath or there is a polite point of entry into the conversation, and ask him about some aspects of the process that you <em>don't</em> know.  Find ways to learn more than you already know.  He's a senior level guy; if you can't find ways to steer him into giving you useful information then it sounds as if you are more concerned with what you already know than what you don't know.  That's an attitude that could be deadly to your career.</p>\n\n<p>Many times on job interviews I have been given questions to answer and I could not answer them; often I find out that what they really wanted to know was how I reacted when I didn't know the answer.  Often, what you know isn't as important as how well you learn, and how you react to instruction.  Especially when you are only 24 years old.  If that last statement stung a bit, it sounds as if you may be partly causing your own problem.</p>\n\n<p>Push yourself to learn more.  Go to your coworker with more advanced questions.  That's the best way to divert him from the basics; prove that you are ready and able to discuss advanced concepts.  And above all, focus on what you want to learn, <em>not</em> what you know.</p>\n\n<p>\"Or, perhaps, how can I keep my sanity and feeling of self worth if he continues?\"</p>\n\n<p>You can keep your sanity by not basing your feelings of self worth on whether or not this guy you work with acknowledges how much you know, and instead focus on doing your job, improving and getting along with people.  I don't think there is anyone, anywhere who is appreciated as much as they feel they deserve.  And people who focus on getting respect rather than deserving it spend their whole lives chasing the wind.</p>\n",
            " <p>The short answer is you have to take control of the conversations.  You have allowed him to have control.</p>\n\n<p>Begin by asking very pointed, direct questions, and even then only when necessary.  If you ask open-ended questions, he is (apparently) the type that will take that opportunity to lecture.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of asking \"How does the consumables tracking module work with the client billing module?\"  ask him, \"Do you have the interface specification between the consumables tracking module and the client billing module?\"  Then if he starts to explain what consumables are or why you need to bill the client, you have every reason to say, \"I hate to interrupt, but I'm already familiar with both the systems, and I'd really like to get working on this interface issue right away.  Can you please give the the interface specification.\"</p>\n\n<p>Obviously that's pretty specific for the purpose of an example, but by tightening the focus of your questions, you demonstrate your familiarity and competence with the technologies, and present yourself as a \"business-only, get-it-done\" type, which is not necessarily rare, but somewhat unexpected from your age group.</p>\n\n<p>If he's well-meaning, as you said you believe, a couple of weeks of this should change his dynamic with you.  If he's trying to prop himself up at your expense, then he'll soon see you as unsuitable for that purpose, and find a new \"apprentice.\"  Either way, he should stop treating you in the manner that you are frustrated by.</p>\n\n<p>If he does not, then you will have at least laid the groundwork for a complaint to your supervisor that your time is being wasted with \"Computer Science 131.\"</p>\n",
            " <p>My advice, to be blunt: suck it up.  If you like the job and the only problem is that a senior member of staff politely offers you guidance that you don't actually need, you should seriously consider that there is no such thing as a perfect job, and if it isn't this annoyance at the next job, it will be something else.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry to say it but you <em>are</em> still quite young and haven't even been there 6 months.  It will take time to prove your skill and knowledge and value to this team.  If you quit now you'll be the new guy on some other team, and you'll have to prove yourself to them.  </p>\n\n<p>So, get a thicker skin and don't let the fact that this guy doesn't think you know what you're doing bother you.  Answer <strong>politely</strong> with phrases like, \"thanks, I did know that\" or \"yes, I learned that a couple of years ago when working on X\" etc. and resolve not to let it bother you.  You can't control his actions, you can only control your own reactions. Don't get offended.  Just observe to yourself \"hmm, Larry still doesn't think I know how to do X -- that's silly since he knows I did Y at my prior company, which I couldn't have accomplished without knowing X.  Oh well, I guess he just wants to be sure.\"  And then stop thinking about it, don't obsess over it, don't try to get him to stop, don't try to barge in and finish his sentences.  Just let it go.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a mutual boss, you might also go to him/her and say something like \"Larry insists on continually giving me programming pointers that I don't need, and at this point I'm starting to find it a little insulting.  Is there any chance you could encourage him to lay off a bit?\"  If there isn't someone obvious to have this conversation with, revert back to \"suck it up\" and manage your reaction. </p>\n",
            " <p>Reverse it, and start teaching him how to do his job at the most fundamental level. Randomly explain to him what a method is.  When any opportunity arises, explain to him why you'd declare a variable as an int instead of a String. Explain to him the order of operations. Have a heart to heart to him as to why it's good to declare constants instead of having numbers throughout your code. Each time he offers you basic, unsolicited advice make sure you give him 2 ridiculous suggestions that same day. Within a week he'll stop.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: There was some element of hyperbole in there, but I've dealt with the type of people the OP has talked about. He has tried to discuss this head on, and that hasn't worked.We tried the same thing. He would talk down to us truly in our best interests he thought, and he meant well, but no matter what we said he would keep doing it.Finally as a joke someone said let's do the same thing to him, and for a week or 2 everyone would explain to him how to use for loops, the differences between MySQL engines, etc.He got the point and then some. He never fully stopped but for sure it decreased </p>\n",
            " <p>As a Senior / Lead Developer with a management degree here's the best way I've found and tested many times to deal with this sort of situation - assuming the person you're dealing with isn't just being evil.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Walk up to this guy and say \"Do you have fifteen minutes we could chat about something?\".</li>\n<li>Find an area out of the general flow of people (conference room is best if those are available) - Never give this sort of feedback in a public area; he'll get defensive and it won't have the intended effect of curbing the behavior.</li>\n<li>Use this formula: \"Lately it feels like you've been doing a lot of X.  When you do X it does Y.\"  </li>\n<li>In your case its; \"Lately it feels like you've been trying to help me out with a bunch of fundamental things I already know.  When you tell me things I already know, it makes me feel as though you don't value the experience that I do have which makes it harder to improve based on your feedback\".</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Bam.  This generally works for most level headed reasonably not-evil people.  If he is actually being a jerk about it; its time to raise that concern with your manager.</p>\n\n<p>He also may genuinely think you are at that level; which actually talking to him like this may help to change.  A lot of times its hard for seniors or leads to gauge where a developer is at; unless they have personally spent a fair amount of time with the person (or interviewed them for this purpose).</p>\n",
            " <p>The guy is possibly insecure, probably alot less paid than you and frustrated. His behaviour may be genuine but it definitely makes him feel senior to you, especially if someone overhears him 'coaching' you. I've been (and in many ways still am) in a similar situation. I just grinned and beared it for a while but that didn't work. Then I spoke to him about it. That worked for a week. The tipping point came when he actually complained about me as I was ignoring him more and more ( ' I'm too busy etc' ). Fortunately at that moment I'd gathered enough qudos on successful projects with the manager that the guy got shot down and put in his place after the next meeting. At which point I rather condescendingly put the boot in suggesting to my manager that perhaps his lack of professional behaviour was because he is frustrated about his job (which I genuinely believe). He is now known as someone who exhibits unprofessional behaviour and lost alot of respect. I defended his work recently to my manager and he thanked me for it. Which possibly even confirmed my 'seniority' over him, I don't know time will tell. But I also discovered that he has a very good reason to be frustrated, which means I've far more patience with him.</p>\n\n<p>There is no easier way to handle your situation as everyone is different. At the end of the day you've just got to be as professional and polite as possible. That doesn't mean you have to listen, especially if you are busy.</p>\n\n<p>Actually I just thought, maybe its even one of his objectives to 'coach' you!!\nIn that case maybe there is something else you can learn from him and ask him to redirect his 'coaching' to that instead. </p>\n",
            " <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Ask advanced questions.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I know how you feel as I, too, don't like it very much when someone tries to teach me something I <em>believe</em> I can teach others. I'm a dev, too.</p>\n\n<p>Let me sum up my perspective here:</p>\n\n<p>You say you are a dev. Being a dev means one and only one thing for sure: <em>there's always plenty to learn regardless of how much you already know</em>. </p>\n\n<p>You say that your <em>colleague</em> is a senior dev and you aren't yet you are on the same level in the team.</p>\n\n<p>Your colleague doesn't mean it to insult you when he gives you unsolicited advice. You think he means well.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, he is a senior in the company and that should mean that he knows things worth learning - you <em>too</em> want to be a senior dev some day, preferably some day soon. </p>\n\n<p>So, here's what I would do if I were you:</p>\n\n<p>Count to ten and in meantime try to control my anger and hurt feelings. </p>\n\n<p>and finally <strong>ask advanced questions</strong> once your coworker is done with the basics.</p>\n\n<p>My short and simple experiences as a dev tell me that <strong>nothing can gain you respect faster and easier than asking <em>good</em> questions</strong>. If you don't have questions, find a hole in your expertise you want to patch - I'm sure there's more than one. Then start asking.</p>\n\n<p>This will have some positive side-effects: you can get on good terms with your colleague very quickly. The willingness to help out will be used for good, and you'll learn new stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Or you'll come to discover that the basic level of advice is all your coworker is capable of and he'll bother you no more when he's failed to answer two or three well aimed questions of yours.</p>\n",
            " <p>There seems to be a bit of a case of narcissistic injury here. I understand why it might be frustrating to be have someone explain the basics to you when at your level you will have a firm grasp of them. You shouldn't let this turn into irritation towards the person trying to help you however. You do not know everything at this point so you are going to get advice and tips from time to time, a lot of them will be things you already know.</p>\n\n<p>I think the problem with this individual is he doesn't believe you're a professional. I'm sure there is some blame on his end, judging you by your age or not taking the time to learn your experience, but it may be you need to present yourself more professionally as you mentioned. </p>\n\n<p>Should he bring up a basic topic, respond with \"Yes, I've actually worked on this before in a similar situation X years ago.. have you thought about this approach?\" and give an example of your experience (without interrupting him). This will help show the person that you know your stuff and whether they continue to offer simple advice or not it will improve your relationship with them.</p>\n\n<p>It might be they're just the type who likes to offer a lot of advice and doesn't expect people to take offense. You may just have to get used to it and if that doesn't seem like an option you're just going to have to air it out with them, politely ask them to hold back on the advice as you see it as a distraction or unnecessary, being direct without being offensive and avoiding any passive-aggressive or petty responses.</p>\n\n<p>HTH</p>\n",
            " <p>You are describing what could be a paradigm shift: In his mind he may just be trying to be helpful, and he is unaware that he is making you feel talked down to. He may also just have the bad habit of being condescending to less senior people to try to assert his dominance. </p>\n\n<p>He should be paying more attention to your reaction and body langue and see if he is offending you. The fellow may not have highly developed social skills. You might want to try asking someone else what they think of him and they may confirm he is just condescending. </p>\n\n<p>Some people don't like to be given unsolicited advice. Giving poor or unsophisticated unsolicited advice is then adding injury to insult.</p>\n\n<p>This simplest thing to do is to politely and kindly tell him when he talks to you that way, you feel talked down to, and you don't like it. If you become hostile or aggressive during this conversation you may further strain your relationship. When you talk to him watch his face closely. Is he getting mad or frustrated or does he look concerned or apologetic?</p>\n\n<p>If he responds with anything but an apology then he has poor social skills, is trying to exert some lame dominance over you, or he is just condescending.</p>\n\n<p>Really it just sounds like he has poor social skills and is not up to speed on the principles and benefits of engagement. Proceed gently because he is in fact handicapped.</p>\n",
            " <p>Does he do this just to you, or to everyone?</p>\n\n<p>This may be a specific technique of keeping the team on the same page.  Those things you think are simple and basic - I guarantee there's some 30% of programmers out there that don't believe/agree with them. He may simply be showing agile team leadership by continuing to restate core values. This provides an opportunity for you and the rest of the team to either reinforce (\"Yes, we should always write unit tests\") or open for discussion (\"Well, but actually there is such a thing as too many unit tests\"). </p>\n\n<p>As you are new, he may be making sure to run through all the various existing shared team values to see if you're all on the same page and you are misinterpreting that badly. It definitely sounds like you are younger and value the independence part of the job more than the team part of the job. You should carefully reevaluate his statements through this lens, because from the agile engineering team manager point of view, \"great programmer who doesn't work well with his team\" is \"someone we regret more having to let go.\"</p>\n\n<p>Obviously just having a direct discussion with him about \"hey you keep telling me basic things and it makes me feel like you think I'm a dope, what's up with that\" will bring his real motivations out - I am not sure why you didn't do this within a week of this starting to bug you, and it reinforces my thoughts that something like the above dynamic is really in play here.</p>\n"

If you like the job and the only problem is that a senior member of staff politely offers you guidance that you don't actually need, you should seriously consider that there is no such thing as a perfect job, and if it isn't this annoyance at the next job, it will be something else.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry to say it but you <em>are</em> still quite young and haven't even been there 6 months.  It will take time to prove your skill and knowledge and value to this team.  If you quit now you'll be the new guy on some other team, and you'll have to prove yourself to them.  </p>\n\n<p>So, get a thicker skin and don't let the fact that this guy doesn't think you know what you're doing bother you.  Answer <strong>politely</strong> with phrases like, \"thanks, I did know that\" or \"yes, I learned that a couple of years ago when working on X\" etc. and resolve not to let it bother you.  You can't control his actions, you can only control your own reactions. Don't get offended.  Just observe to yourself \"hmm, Larry still doesn't think I know how to do X -- that's silly since he knows I did Y at my prior company, which I couldn't have accomplished without knowing X.  Oh well, I guess he just wants to be sure.\"  And then stop thinking about it, don't obsess over it, don't try to get him to stop, don't try to barge in and finish his sentences.  Just let it go.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a mutual boss, you might also go to him/her and say something like \"Larry insists on continually giving me programming pointers that I don't need, and at this point I'm starting to find it a little insulting.  Is there any chance you could encourage him to lay off a bit?\"  If there isn't someone obvious to have this conversation with, revert back to \"suck it up\" and manage your reaction. </p>\n",

When any opportunity arises, explain to him why you'd declare a variable as an int instead of a String. Explain to him the order of operations. Have a heart to heart to him as to why it's good to declare constants instead of having numbers throughout your code. Each time he offers you basic, unsolicited advice make sure you give him 2 ridiculous suggestions that same day. Within a week he'll stop.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: There was some element of hyperbole in there, but I've dealt with the type of people the OP has talked about. He has tried to discuss this head on, and that hasn't worked.We tried the same thing. He would talk down to us truly in our best interests he thought, and he meant well, but no matter what we said he would keep doing it.Finally as a joke someone said let's do the same thing to him, and for a week or 2 everyone would explain to him how to use for loops, the differences between MySQL engines, etc.He got the point and then some.

            " <p>I think they chose wisely when they decided to call the points tallied in the StackExchange system \"reputation\". Anything you connect with your name will affect your actual reputation. Employers are unlikely to care about the numeric connection, but if/when they read your responses, those responses are going to reflect back on you. Even if you maintain separate accounts, ultimately there is a good chance to slip up and accidentally link them somewhere. Possibly an email address, a cross post, an accidental post, etc. Once they become linked by any of the search engines the exercise of separating the accounts will have proved pointless.</p>\n\n<p>My advice, as someone who interviews software engineers (and I do check them out online), is to remain entirely anonymous for any activity that you don't want publicly associated with your name. However, from the same standpoint, I typically disregard 90% of what I see online regarding a candidate that does not specifically impact their work habits and behaviors. I can understand the desire to keep some things from being related to you in this respect, but I don't think multiple accounts will do you any favors in the long run. </p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I've been having horrible luck with job interviews. I have been to many - my resume is great - but just never get the job. </p>\n\n<p>Recently I spoke with a doctor and he put me on the autism spectrum. It's not a big thing, but it involves me having trouble speaking with new people, making eye contact, etc. </p>\n\n<p>I believe the two things may be related. Is this something that I can and should mention during an interview, or does this look bad? (i.e \"You might not get a good first impression, but don't worry!\"). How can I convey this in a professional manner?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>EDIT (since my original answer may already be irrelevant):</p>\n\n<p>Since you seem to be a newcomer to the job market as Anketam correctly guessed. It could just be that you're blowing things out of proportion and psyching yourself out simply because you're not used to rejection.   </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have been to many - my resume is great - but just never get the job.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Job-hunting is a numbers game. That's why it's important to never to use absolute quantifiers like \"never\" or \"always\", and never use vague evasive words like \"many\" when assessing your behavior. </p>\n\n<p>The truth is that you have to treat job-hunting like a real job and that entails using real numbers. Also, it's a fact that rejection doesn't feel good (not just for you, but for everybody), and that our minds are trying to blow that feeling out of proportion so to avoid getting more rejections in the future. </p>\n\n<p>ORIGINAL ANSWER (which may no longer be relevant):</p>\n\n<p>What you're suggesting would go against conventional wisdom, but assuming the job you're looking for is software-related or math-related, and is non-managerial, it may be worth a shot mentioning it. </p>\n\n<p>But I would be very careful with that. Going against conventions is risky. And if you do this, you should try <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\" rel=\"nofollow\">AB testing</a> it. </p>\n\n<p>Just note that in the US, HR departments would try to censor that information out of any resume/cover letter you write, or out of any preliminary interview you take with them, so if you do this, you'll want to mention it to the hiring manager during the job interview, or mention it to them, instead of HR, if you're able to make first contact with them directly.  </p>\n\n<p>On one hand, you don't want to give them a reason to discriminate against you, but on the other hand, they may already be discriminating against you based on your outward behavior during the interview, and putting a label on your behavior could be a good way to bypass that concern. </p>\n\n<p>That being said, the ideal solution would be to focus on your interviewing skills and practice interviewing. After all, even people with autism can improve their verbal and non-verbal demeanor with training. But that is no guarantee either. Perhaps the doctor who diagnosed you could recommend a specialist who could help you with that. </p>\n\n<p>Aside from professional therapy, I'd suggest you take a look at practicing public speaking with <a href=\"http://www.toastmasters.org/Find-a-Club\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toastmasters</a> and practicing technical interviews with <a href=\"https://www.pramp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pramp</a> (assuming you're interviewing for a software developer position). The former is a non-profit public speaking club that has chapters pretty much everywhere.

Now, when I view internship postings online, I see that most of them specify the condition that I must be a \"student currently enrolled in a Bachelor\u2019s or Master\u2019s degree program\" or the like. Note that I am looking specifically for research-based or graduate-level internships (not PEY, not co-op).</p>\n\n<p>Given that this clause is present on all Canadian internship postings that were pertinent to me, will companies accept an application from someone who would have graduated by the time they start the internship?</p>\n\n<p>Edit:\nI will be legally allowed to work for any company <em>after</em> I finish my studies, but cannot work full-time during my degree, hence why I am looking to see if I can do an internship <em>after</em> my studies conclude.</p>\n\n<p>I am also not looking for legal/immigration advice. Mostly wondering if there were others like me, who managed to get an internship offer after graduating in Canada, despite the \"currently enrolled\" requirement, or if there is someone who knows more about the internship process from behind-the-scenes.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> <em>My business partner has blocked me from contacting him personally and no longer contributes to our business. Is it necessary to inform him that I no longer will be performing my responsibilities as outlined in our agreement?</em></p>\n\n<p>My co-founder 'Bob' and I have a Partnership Agreement to run a small online business - a Youtube channel along with a few social media accounts. His responsibilities were research and recording audio; mine were research, video production, and running the social media accounts. Our venture has not earned any money. Bob also was my long distance relationship boyfriend.</p>\n\n<p>Bob's contribution since the beginning of the venture has been up-and-down. There were a few weeks in which he would record as per the schedule we agreed upon, and then stop after a minor setback (ie. our videos did not receive views/comments). I would ask him from time to time to return to schedule, but he asked me to stop doing so. He did, however, buy a ~$30 microphone to record, of his own volition. He never stated that he no longer wanted to be business partners. I take responsibility for being too lax in negotiating.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I kept to the video production schedule, and I have updated (and continue to update) the social media accounts everyday.</p>\n\n<p>A few months ago Bob and I broke up amicably, but did not discuss what to do with the business. I continued updating the social media accounts during that time. After about a month or so to let the steam cool, I called Bob up to say that I was still interested in running the business and if he was interested in continuing our SOLELY business partnership. He indicated that he was interested in recording again.</p>\n\n<p>The next day I found out that Bob had blocked my personal lines of contact to him.</p>\n\n<p>I have not tried contacting him since then, but I have continued to update the social media accounts. I am no longer interested in doing so, and would like to know if it would be necessary to inform Bob, who is still in a Partnership Agreement with me, that I will no longer be performing my responsibilities as outlined in the agreement. He has not blocked the business's e-mail or social media accounts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> OP here. To clarify further, as this looks to be a point of confusion, Bob has not performed his responsibilities to the business since several weeks before we broke up. All in all, thank you everyone for your responses and advice.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

Shouldn't it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>NDA = <strong>non-disclosure</strong> agreement.

His actions are likely to scare you off. Scaring off potential hires is not in B's interest. And if this gets out, it is going to significantly impact other applicants' willingness to engage in talks with this company.</p>\n<p>In short: blabbing to A about you applying for a job at B means <strong>he would actively selling out B for A's benefit</strong>. That's is a major no-no for anyone who has (and wishes to keep) a good relationship with B.</p>\n<p>So the logical thing to do for this person is to not spill the beans, so as not to ruin their own relationship with B.</p>\n<p>But that doesn't mean that they won't do it.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I don't know how best to describe it, but I do work where I go to various (public and retail) locations and promote various products. I find work through a few different agencies that usually don't place me in the same location for more than a few days in a row</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly I got a few longer term offers for the length of 1 month or more. As such I need to cancel some of shifts I had already said I would do with other agencies. I don't like doing this but right now money is important for me as I'm trying to pay off student loans.</p>\n\n<p>How do I best phrase this in an email?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hi,</p>\n  \n  <p>Regarding job x at location y on date z, I'm very sorry but I've\n  become double booked and will no longer be able to attend. If at all\n  helpful, I have contacts that can cover my shift.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A large part of which one's I decided to keep and which one's I cancel on, is based on pay. Should I mention this or not (some did pay bellow standard)?</p>\n\n<p>I would like to keep on good terms with the agencies as possible as I would like to find work with them in the future.</p>\n\n<p>I got two longer term offers from 2 different agencies. Coincidentally the second starts on the same week as the first one ends. So I have to miss a couple shifts if I were to do both. How can I phrase this email asking if this is possible or if they need someone who can do 100% of the shifts?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hi,</p>\n  \n  <p>Due to a resent change in my schedule, I was wondering if it's\n  possible someone else can do the shifts for event x on day y and z?\n  Unfortunately I've become double booked. Please let me know before changing > anything and I'll reply back.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Last sentence is important as some of these agencies are quick to jump the gun and I don't want both of them to cancel shifts and be left without any work on these days. Does this email convey the point correctly?</p>\n\n<p>I don't want to say this is contract work as I never signed a contract. As such, it is legal what I'm doing, but again I do feel bad about cancelling on them. </p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
