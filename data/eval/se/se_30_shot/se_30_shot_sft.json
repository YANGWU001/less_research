Being a naive undergraduate, I knocked on proffessor's doors, asking for a supervisor, and one of them, very generously agreed. He suggested a problem I thought was interesting and so I started the research. I originally started throwing analysis at the problem, and started trying to solve some really complex differential equations (which kept me motivated). However I did not make much progress, so after my supervisor marked that I needed to get something, I fully changed my approach and started using some geometric approximations to solve the issue. This generated some results, but was too simple. I'd like to say that my results were inversely proportional to how much effort I was putting in the research.</p>\n\n<p>Time passed, I had multiple potential solutions and a way to evaluate them. On the last week before the final submission I realised there was a bug in my code base that was destroying the results (they were mathematically impossible). I tried to find the error, but the best I could do was identify an area where a mistake could have happened. </p>\n\n<p>Finally I got my evaluation on the course after presenting it. The feedback said the methods were a bit naive and could be improved on, and it was dissapointing that I didn't get numerical results (I had visual results, not numerical), however since I was not a seasoned researcher they decided to be lenient and gave me an A anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I applied to the grad program at my university, and asked the same proffessor to be my supervisor for the grad program. I am in desperate need of financial support until the grad program starts, and so my supervisor said I could do summer research for him and in the meanwhile we could discuss what the grad project could be. What he wants me to do is finish my previous work and get a publication. </p>\n\n<p>The issue is that I legitimately feel that dinking bleach would be more motivating (I am using this metaphor to convey just how much anxiety this is giving me). This research really does not appeal to me in any way or form, and the interesting part is over, all that is missing is finding the bug, which could take more than two weeks to solve and implementing a couple of modifications to make my naive methods less naive if things go well, or complete failure to finish it in the worst case.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to that I have been doing independent research simultaneously as I have been taking courses and doing everything else. Although this independent research still needs a lot of work, it's in a good place, I have already improved many of the papers I have read and have multiple ideas to explore. In an ideal world I would win the lottery tomorrow and I could just support myself while I carry on with this research.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure how to approach my supervisor and tell him I don't want to finish this research, nor how to suggest to do my research instead and get a publication out of that, or even if I should touch on this topic at all.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

The staff member apparently gave her a \"funny look\", which confirmed the postdoc's view that this staff member is abusing their position of privilege. Anyone who points out that this is a total non sequitur is accused of allowing bullying to flourish. </p>\n\n<p>This situation has been building steadily over the last few years and now five or six postdocs keep a running tally of \"microaggressions\" so microscopic that it is very difficult to see how they can exist. For example, one postdoc sits with their back to a door, and a professor came in to talk to another colleague, and didn't acknowledge them. This incident was talked about for weeks as evidence of the professor's \"rudeness\". In other cases, some people are labelled \"creeps\".</p>\n\n<p>To be clear: I absolutely do not condone abuse. I know power dynamics are real, and that many minorities (of which I belong to several) experience daily microaggressions and othering. I have been on the receiving end of workplace bullying myself, and would never wish to silence real problems. I too am a postdoc, so have no additional power and gain nothing from allowing abuse to flourish.</p>\n\n<p>What worries me is that none of these incidents are being raised with any of the staff members in question. Therefore, many junior researchers have accepted as fact that their professors are horrible and selfish people. I'm concerned about this mindset, because in at least three cases, these \"selfish\" professors have some form of autism (I know this as I'm a wellness officer). Perfectly ordinary behaviour is framed as malicious.</p>\n\n<p>Personally I've found it very upsetting. Many of the people on the receiving end of this gossip are very kind, if not socially awkward, people. It scares me that so many people uncritically accept that everyone with a permanent job is some kind of bogeyman; of course, I cannot betray confidentiality by informing my colleagues that many of these incidents didn't occur and indeed it's kind of ableist to assume you can read minds all the time. Abuse and power struggles certainly can, and often do, occur... but if any of these complaints were substantial they should be raised with HR. </p>\n\n<p>The sad truth is that I think my colleagues just get their power from trash talking others, and aren't actually interested in the truth. Dissenting voices get shunned (and accused of being privileged / not being woke). Anyone who isn't in 100% agreement gets immediately shut down. But, also, my colleagues are just upsetting themselves for no reason. They're scared of encountering these \"terrifying\" professors, most of who have done nothing worse than dressing slightly shabbily and being uncomfortable with eye contact. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone have any advice on dealing with this kind of situation?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

I was not the last candidate, so, by considering the last one, the search was closed one week ago. In the last meeting with the department chair, he said the department will select the final candidate next week and it seems they have made some decisions based on the information I have. I received an update this weekend from the department chair indicating that they are working with the dean's office and I should get an update this week. First, I interpreted this email positively in a way that probably I will be their first choice since they should keep all finalists on hold until the first candidate (assuming to be me!) signs the offer, which normally takes time (negotiation, salary, lab space, ...). So, there is no reason to notify me if I am not the first candidate.</p>\n<p>Then, I looked at this matter differently and thought maybe they already have offered another candidate and they are indeed waiting to get some approval from the dean for that person (probably the candidate has some requests). Because sometimes dean's office can approve the final candidate after a few days since it should not be a long process. I am not sure which case is more likely. I know that I should be more patient, but it is honestly difficult!</p>\n<p>So, my question is about your experience with the hiring process and its timeline.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

Decisions get made according to some opaque process of which only a small amount of detail is revealed to you, the candidate. But the bureaucracy of a university, and the dynamics of a job search involving multiple finalist candidates, are complicated, so the reality on the ground can involve a lot more that\u2019s going on than what you are being told. I don\u2019t mean a lot more necessarily bad stuff, or a lot more good stuff - just in general more people and more decisions (some perfunctory and some that are more uncertain) on which the outcome depends. Some of those decisions can be purely logistical or financial in nature (or even political) and quite far removed from the question of whether you are \u201cgood enough\u201d to get hired by university X.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is, if the department chair is competent then they have likely shared the maximal amount of information they can reasonably share with you at this point without risking misleading you into believing the outcome will be either better or worse than it might end up being. The only thing that\u2019s reasonably certain at this point is that you\u2019re still a viable candidate. For anything else, you\u2019ll have to wait for the black box to do its thing.

Countries near the bottom of this ranking have the feature that most if not all of their main institutions experience high levels of dishonesty and unethical behavior.

Should I try to find a rare honest person around me in a position of power to complain to about the dishonesty I observe? Will this change anything?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My answer is probably not a very helpful one, but I think it is the only realistic one: <strong>leave</strong>. The forces you are trying to fight are so much bigger and more powerful than you, that unless you are willing to dedicate your entire life to fighting them, knowing that you will achieve either nothing or very little, your only other choice would be to keep your head down, either ignore or join in the cheating, and resign yourself to a life of dissatisfaction and unfulfilled dreams.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry it's pessimistic and depressing, but there it is.

Also, wiping the device and starting over - signing in to Files first might be a reasonable thing to try if you have a good backup.

It does have a theoretical security risk, but if you know what you are installing and you do it from authentic sources (like the app store or well known developers you trust), then you should be fine. Otherwise refrain. To read more about kext signing see: <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/developer-id/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.apple.com/developer-id/</a> </p>\n"

See <a href=\"https://askubuntu.com/a/1047413/22949\">WinEunuuchs2Unix's answer</a> as well as <a href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/1186999/how-does-sudo-handle-home-differently-since-19-10\">this question</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Graphical applications often store settings and other user-specific data in configuration files written inside the user's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory\" rel=\"noreferrer\">home folder</a>. The main mechanism applications use to determine what they should use as the user's home folder is the <code>HOME</code> <a href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables\" rel=\"noreferrer\">environment variable</a>. (You can inspect it yourself with <code>echo $HOME</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Suppose you're running <a href=\"http://manpages.ubuntu.com/gedit.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>gedit</code></a> (a graphical text editor) as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_user#Unix_and_Unix-like\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>root</code></a>. If you run <code><a href=\"http://manpages.ubuntu.com/sudo.8\" rel=\"noreferrer\">sudo</a> gedit</code>, <code>HOME</code> will continue to point toward <em>your</em> home directory, even though the program is running <em>as <code>root</code></em>. Consequently, <code>gedit</code> will write configuration files <em>as <code>root</code></em> into your home directory. This <a href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/632798/what-specific-bad-things-happen-when-gedit-is-used-with-sudo\">will sometimes result</a> in the configuration files being <em><a href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions\" rel=\"noreferrer\">owned</a> by <code>root</code></em> and thus <a href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/150028/you-are-not-the-owner-message-when-trying-to-access-folder\"><em>inaccessible to you</em></a> (when you later run the program as yourself and not as <code>root</code>). This mainly happens when the application has to create a new configuration file. Newly created files, by default, are owned by the user who creates them (who in this case is <code>root</code>, not you).</p>\n\n<p>That's the primary reason why you should run graphical applications with a graphical <code>sudo</code> frontend rather than with straight <code>sudo</code>. In Ubuntu and most of its derivatives (including Xubuntu and Lubuntu), the standard graphical frontend is <a href=\"http://manpages.ubuntu.com/gksu.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>gksu</code>/<code>gksudo</code></a>. In Kubuntu it is <a href=\"http://manpages.ubuntu.com/kdesudo.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>kdesudo</code></a>. (It depends on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment#Desktop_environments_for_the_X_Window_System\" rel=\"noreferrer\">desktop environment</a> being used.)</p>\n\n<p>If you <em>want</em> to use <code>sudo</code> directly to run a graphical application like <code>gedit</code>, you can run:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo -H gedit\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>-H</code> flag makes <code>sudo</code> set <code>HOME</code> to point to <code>root</code>'s home folder (which is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//root\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>/root</code></a>).</p>\n\n<p>That still won't automatically handle the ownership of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_authorization#Cookie-based_access\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>.Xauthority</code></a> by copying it to a temp folder (this is the other thing that graphical <code>sudo</code> frontends take care of for you). But in the infrequent event that <code>.Xauthority</code> is inaccessible, you'll get an error saying it is, and then you can fix the problem by deleting it (<code>sudo rm ~/.Xauthority</code>), as it's automatically regenerated. Thus, protecting <code>.Xauthority</code>'s ownership and permissions is less important than protecting the ownership and permissions of configuration files.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast to a <code>root</code>-owned <code>.Xauthority</code>, when configuration files become owned as <code>root</code>, it's not always as obvious what the problem is (because graphical programs will often run, but not work very well, and output any useful errors to the console). And it's sometimes a bigger hassle to fix, especially <em>if you're in a situation where you want one or more files in your home directory to be owned by someone other than you</em> (because then you cannot fix it simply by recursively <code>chown</code>ing all your files back to yourself).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, <code>sudo</code> (at least without <code>-H</code>) should not be used to run a graphical application <em>unless</em> you are highly familiar with the app's inner workings and know for sure that it does not ever attempt to write any configuration files.</p>\n"

In every cycle the open source video drivers were not enough, meaning that something was not working right.

So I always installed the ATI proprietary drivers, thus solving the issues. </p>\n\n<p>Precise was the first OS upgrade I have ever made (for the old ones I always made a complete new install). So, before upgrade, I have uninstalled the ATI drivers and reverted to the open source one in order to avoid issues.</p>\n\n<p>After the upgrade everything is working as it should with the open source drivers Gallium 0.4. I have all the nice 3D features and full HD movies are running.</p>\n\n<p>So, I am really asking myself, if there would be any reason for me to turn back to the propriety drivers from ATI?

                "role": "assistant",
                "content": " <p>I think you are not only confused about <em>config</em> files and <em>binary</em> files but also about <em>config</em> files and <em>scripts</em>. Let me show a very simple example and start with a <em>config file</em>:</p>\n\n<h3>Config file <code>hello.conf</code></h3>\n\n<pre><code>WHAT=World\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This simple text file just sets a configuration variable. It sets the variable <code>WHAT</code> to the value <code>World</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Now consider a simple <em>script file</em> that uses the value defined in the <em>config file</em> <code>hello.conf</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>Script file <code>hello.sh</code></h3>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-bash prettyprint-override\"><code>#!/bin/bash\n\nsource hello.conf\necho \"Hello, $WHAT\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The first line tells the OS how to handle this file. In this case it will be run by the <code>/bin/bash</code> program. <code>bash</code> knows the syntax we use in this script and acts accordingly. That is: it <em>sources</em> (=reads) our <em>config file</em> <code>hello.conf</code> and then is able to use all the definitions we made in that file. Next, it echoes the string <code>Hello,</code> followed by the content of the variable <code>$WHAT</code> from the config file. If we run that script, we get:</p>\n\n<pre><code>user@host # ./hello.sh\nHello, World\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we could change the <em>config file</em> to contain, for example, <code>WHAT=Jim</code> instead. We can now run the very same <em>script file</em> without any change but it will now print</p>\n\n<pre><code>user@host # ./hello.sh\nHello, Jim\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So <em>config files</em> are a way to change the behaviour of programs without touching the programs themselves. This separation of data and code is an important step in programming as it helps keeping the code clean and independent of the data.</p>\n\n<p>Now for something more complicated: A <em>binary file</em>. I've written a simple program in a programming language called <code>C</code>. The special thing about it is that we first write <em>source code</em> in a text file and then <em>translate</em> (we say <em>compile</em>) that text file into a machine readable (binary) form. This binary form is no longer human-readable (well, at least not easily), but the machine can read it perfectly.</p>\n\n<h3><code>C</code> source file <code>hello.c</code></h3>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-c prettyprint-override\"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    FILE *file = fopen( \"hello.conf\", \"r\" );\n    if (file) {\n        char line[1024];\n        char what[256];\n        while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), file)) {\n            if (sscanf(line, \"WHAT=%s\", what) == 1) {\n                printf( \"Hello, %s\\n\", what );\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        fclose(file);    \n    }    \n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can already see, this is far more and more complicated code than we used for the <code>hello.sh</code> and I already omitted error handling to simplify it. However, this code is of no use to the OS. We first need to <em>compile</em> (translate) it into a machine readable form. That's what compilers are for and I'll use <code>gcc</code> (a standard <code>C</code> compiler) here. So:</p>\n\n<pre><code>user@host # gcc hello.c -o hello\nuser@host # ls -l\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 8536 Jan  6 12:43 hello\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  423 Jan  6 12:16 hello.c\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user   11 Jan  6 12:18 hello.conf\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 user user   60 Jan  6 12:26 hello.sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The compiler produced the <em>binary</em> file <code>hello</code> (without any extension) and we can now execute that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>user@host # ./hello\nHello, Jim\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we can again change the definition in the <code>hello.conf</code> to change the behaviour of our <em>binary</em> program <code>hello</code> without changing the source code and re-compiling it. I could now send that binary <code>hello</code> without the <code>C</code> source code (<code>hello.c</code>) to someone else and he can execute that binary together with a proper config file <code>hello.conf</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Binary files (like a compiled C program) and script files (like bash scripts) have various differences, some of which are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Binaries are (almost) immutable, i.e. a \nuser cannot change the code they execute (only \nthe data they operate on). They behave as they \nwere written and compiled.</li>\n<li>Binaries usually run faster \nthan scripts because the syntax check and has \nalready been done at compile time (just once). \nThe compiler will also optimize the code while \ntranslating to run even faster.</li>\n<li>Scripts on the other hand are \nevaluated (checked) each time the script \nis run. This can take time.</li>\n<li>Scripts are human-readable, i.e. a user can look into\na script and tell what it does.\nThis is not easily possible for binaries as you already\nnoticed. Without a really deep, deep knowledge of the machine\nreadable code you cannot tell what the binary actually\ndoes. You have to believe what the documentation says or\nwhat the programmer told you.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The last item is where <em>Open Source</em> kicks in: the idea is that binaries are shipped together with the source code so a user can see the source code and compile the programs himself. <em>Closed Source</em> software on the other hand just ships with the binaries.</p>\n"

It is only through their combination can millions of colors be produced by generating a suitable tristimulous response in the brains of viewers with normal human color vision.</p>\n\n<p>It is also possible that you mean not spectral violet but some combination of red and blue along the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_purples\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">line of purples</a>.

This led to The eventual defeat of all Dragons (save Paarthurnax).

The other Dragons, however, have been dead for centuries.</p>\n\n<p>Dragons are believed to have a close affinity to magic. But, if left dead for long periods of time, it would make sense that much of their power has left them, and needs to be restored. It would then make sense why a handful of mere mortals would be able to kill one on a simple reconnaissance mission. </p>\n\n<p>This is further supported by the idea that while dragons fighting could be described as a \"heated debate\", but I would argue that there would have to be some form of residual power involved in using a Thu'um - otherwise that Dragonborn would likely be killing a lot more people simply by sneezing violently.</p>\n\n<p>So, my belief is that Dragons require some level of affinity with Magic to be able to use the Thu'um to it's full effect, which does require time, and training.</p>\n"

If the early game champs fail to make an impact early game then their usefulness is diminished. If a late game champion fails to farm well during the early/mid game they're not going to be stronger than the early game champion late game anyway. \nEx: Tristana 0/5/0 250 cs vs a 5/0/5 draven with 250 cs the draven will most likely win, even if its 50 mins into the game.</p>\n\n<p>In summary (and disclaimer this may be somewhat personal opinion), late game/early game shouldn't influence champ select.

Butterflies spawn during the day, while Moths spawn at night.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Butterflies will take several days to spawn</strong></em> - The user reports 3 days. This is in-game time, so try sleeping for a day, three times.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Butterflies spawn depending on what plants have been planted</strong></em> - a few users report this to not be the case, but one user has a particular experience:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Overlord_Meril</strong></em> says: <em>&quot;I've got two greenhouses, one has purple mountain flowers and wheat. Lots of bees and butterflies show up. But none show up in my other greenhouse that grows imp stool, canis root &amp; mora tapinella.&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Butterflies spawn depending on what furniture you have</strong></em> - There were reports that <em>removing certain furniture</em> would have an effect. While this has been disproven, the original requirement behind spawning butterflies is to furnish the Greenhouse.</p>\n<p><strong>It is entirely possible you have ran into a bug preventing the butterflies from spawning</strong>. If all else fails, it might be worth removing some of the furnishings. Once removed, add it back in. If you &quot;reset&quot; the spawn trigger, you can sometimes get around weird bugs.</p>\n"

            {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": " <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: <em>I'd like to preface this by saying that, practically speaking, the races are on even footing as an Elementalist. None of the current meta builds for WvW include using any racial skills since our class-specific utilities are too great to pass up. However, in the spirit of the question, it is possible to justify a &quot;best&quot; race. Just don't expect it to grant you better performance than any other race.</em></p>\n<p>In order to answer which race is the best race, we have to first consider what your race actually does. Your race in GW2 affects a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your physical appearance</li>\n<li>Racial-locked skins</li>\n<li>The first half of your personal story</li>\n<li>Racial skills</li>\n<li>Certain NPC conversation options</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, we have to consider what we mean by &quot;best.&quot; My assumption is that &quot;best&quot; means &quot;most effective,&quot; and &quot;most effective&quot; includes damage output, survivability, and mobility. As such, only some of the above elements apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your physical appearance</li>\n<li>Racial skills</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, let's assume that by saying &quot;best,&quot; we are agreeing to use the WvW meta builds of Dagger/Dagger roaming or Staff zerging. Anything else is out of the realm of &quot;best.&quot;</p>\n<h1>Physical Appearance</h1>\n<p>The part of your physical appearance that is relevant to your success in PvP would be your visibility. Low visibility improves your survivability as players will attack you less frequently as they do not notice you. It also grants you more opportunity to scout without being spotted. Also, smaller characters' animations are harder to see or interpret, meaning your opponents won't notice the telegraphs of your abilities as easily.</p>\n<p>Shorter characters have less vertical visibility. Thinner characters have less horizontal visibility. At a far distance, your nameplate is not visible and players will have to recognize you purely by your silhouette. As such, you want to be non-noticeable. Technically, your character's skin color and armor color could help them camoflauge. However, a player can select their settings to show team colors which overrides your armor coloring. So, we won't include colors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asura are small in stature. They are the smallest race, and therefore the least visible.</li>\n<li>Charr are the second tallest race. They are also the widest race and very visible.</li>\n<li>Norns are the tallest race. They will easily stand out against a clear background.</li>\n<li>Humans and Sylvari are the same height, but larger than Asura.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In terms of visibility, <strong>Asura</strong> is the best choice.</p>\n<h1>Racial Skills</h1>\n<p>So, physically, Asura is the best race. However, visibility doesn't matter much once you've been spotted. You will need to fight or escape! As such, racial skills might improve your effectiveness.</p>\n<h3>Asuran Racial Skills</h3>\n<p>Asuran utility skills grant an Elementalist access to Confusion, Retaliation, Poison, Weakness, and a long-ranged Daze. The elite skills give you a summonable golem or the <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Summon_Power_Suit\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Power Suit</a>.</p>\n<h3>Charr Racial Skills</h3>\n<p>Charr utility skills have one that grants extra Fury and Might, an extra 15-second cooldown evade with damage attached to it, and a bleeding trap. The elite skills can fire a ground-targeted AoE, conjure a weapon, or summon minions.</p>\n<h3>Norn Racial Skills</h3>\n<p>Norn utility skills grant access to an extra bleed and an summoned (immobile, but powerful) minion. The elite skills are all shape-shifting skills that <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/List_of_norn_racial_skills#Auxiliary_skillbars\" rel=\"noreferrer\">grant new abilities</a> with knockback, knockdown, cripple, daze, life-steal, and bleeds, however no one form has them all.</p>\n<h3>Human Racial Skills</h3>\n<p>Human has a healing skill that is a 30-second cooldown casted burst heal. The utility skills include a condition removal and a random condition + boon applier. The elite skills include <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Avatar_of_Melandru\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a transformation</a>, a minion summon, and an unblockable chill + poison applier.</p>\n<h3>Sylvari Racial Skills</h3>\n<p>Sylvari also has a healing skill that provides rooted regeneration near a targeted location. The utility skills include an immobilize and summoned turrets. The elite skills include one skill that summons multiple turrets, and others that summon minions.</p>\n<h2>Skill Usefulness</h2>\n<p>Many of these skills are essentially useless to Elementalists because we can already do them, regardless of race.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Summoning Minions</strong>: All skills that summon minions pale in comparison to <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glyph_of_Elementals\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Glyph of Elementals</a> and <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glyph_of_Lesser_Elementals\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Glyph of Lesser Elementals</a> because the Glyphs allow you to situationally select an Elemental based on your attunement. All other summons pigeonhole you into a single selection.</li>\n<li><strong>Conditions</strong>: Some skills give you access to conditions. As Dagger/Dagger and staff, you will already have access to Weakness, Fury (from <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Arcane_Fury\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Arcane Fury</a>, one point into Arcane), Chill, and Bleeding. Dagger/Dagger also has access to Immobilize (they have access to other conditions as well, these are just the ones the racial skills provide). Dagger/Dagger typically uses <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sigil_of_Doom\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sigil of Doom</a> to apply Poison passively and continuously during combat.</li>\n<li><strong>Weapon conjures</strong>: Elementalists are the weapon-conjuring class. Weapon conjuring skills are useful for other classes, but not Elementalists.</li>\n<li><strong>Heals</strong>: Since you cannot have the racial heals alongside the Elementalist-specific heals, I'd argue they are useless. The two most used heals for meta builds are <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Signet_of_Restoration\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Signet of Restoration</a> and <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ether_Renewal\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ether Renewal</a>. The Human 1-second cast heal and the Sylvari range-limited Regeneration can't match up to the effectiveness of these.</li>\n<li><strong>Knockback</strong>: Dagger/Dagger and Staff both have access to knockback.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, what is left?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Asura</strong>: 3 stacks of Confusion on a 30-second cooldown and 1200 range Daze. Also, transformation elite.</li>\n<li><strong>Charr</strong>: Extra evade on a 15-second cooldown.</li>\n<li><strong>Norn</strong>: Transformation elites.</li>\n<li><strong>Human</strong>: Transformation elite.</li>\n<li><strong>Sylvari</strong>: Turrets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Considering so many races have transformation elites, let's take a look at that. You only get one elite, so to use a transformation elite means that you don't use <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glyph_of_Elementals\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Glyph of Elementals</a> or <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fiery_Greatsword\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Fiery Greatsword</a>. Roaming Dagger/Dagger almost requires the Greatsword for mobility as Elementalists have a criminally low amount of access to Swiftness without traiting for it and not nearly same mobility as Thieves or Warriors with the Greatsword. And Staff Elementalists don't really get in-your-face, meaning that going into a transformation would force them to go into melee and then back to range after the transformation is over.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, <strong>transformation elites are a wasted elite slot</strong> (unless transforming into a <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tornado\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tornado</a>, but even that is weaker now than it once was).</p>\n<p>At this point, we are left with just the following abilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Asura</strong>: 3 stacks of Confusion on a 30-second cooldown and 1200-range Daze.</li>\n<li><strong>Charr</strong>: Extra evade on a 15-second cooldown.</li>\n<li><strong>Sylvari</strong>: Turrets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In my opinion, none of these are particularly great. However, if we are strictly comparing the races to each other, it would appear that Asura has more viable Utility options than the other races.</p>\n<h1>So, who's the best?</h1>\n<p><strong>Asura</strong> is the best in terms of visibility and Utility. Therefore, it is the best race for Elementalist.</p>\n"

These will tag you for bleeding damage while you are standing in them and then they pop you for 500-600 when they explode.  The only real strategy for these is to run away from them.  I have found that running around the outer edge of his zone gives you the most room to work with and tends to be a lot less busy so you can see yourself the whole time.</p>\n<p><strong>This is not a DPS fight!</strong>  Focus on keeping yourself at full life.  I used the aura that heals you when you use spirit and the one that gives you 100 extra spirit.  I don't think the mantras I had at this point are particularly useful for this fight, but I used the one that increases dodge to help with the first 2 stages.  I also used the aura companion spell and the heal party spell.  I had the enchantress follower with me.</p>\n<p>The basic strategy is to keep your spirit capped off, and as soon as you take damage, blow some spirit.   During the slow parts, run up to him and build your spirit back up.  Don't forget to use your potion if you get into trouble and don't worry about your companions, they will figure it out.  The last piece of advice is to not go crazy and blow all your heals when you take damage.  If he hits you with a whack as you are lighting up your spirit orb or you take a green spit, just cast a single damage spell that uses spirit and save the big cool downs for when you are running away from the green voids.</p>\n<p>Lastly, health globes do pop up in melee range quite often.

If we denote by  $\u03be(x,t)$ the displacement of the air at position x at time t, then the wave equation for displacement is (I added a derivation at the end of this answer):</p>\n\n<p>$$\\frac{\\partial^2 \u03be}{\\partial x^2}=\\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 \u03be}{\\partial t^2}$$</p>\n\n<p>As you cited, the pressure at the open end must be equal to the pressure of ambient air outside the pipe: this is just a boundary condition (I'll come back to this later, but a simple way to understand it is: if we didn't satisfy continuity of pressure, we'd have an infinite pressure gradient and so infinite force). However, for an open end, air can flow freely in and out: that is, the displacement wave does exit and propagate. This diagram shows what happens in an open (left) vs closed pipe (right) of the same length:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/M780g.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/M780g.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The red line is the amplitude of the variation in pressure, whereas the blue line is the amplitude of the variation in the flow of air. As you can see, the amplitude of the displacement wave is a maximum at the open end. </p>\n\n<p>Now, to answer your questions, \"why the pressure at the open end cannot vary from the atmospheric pressure?\" and \"how does the reflection of the wave at the open end occur?\", I'll cite a passage from <a href=\"http://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/flutes.v.clarinets.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this wonderful explanation</a> I've found (you should take a look at the animations if this is not clear enough, or alternatively at <a href=\"http://www.animations.physics.unsw.edu.au/waves-sound/standing-waves/index.html#8.5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this video</a>): Let's send a pulse of air down a cylindrical pipe open at the end. Then...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It reaches the end of the tube and its momentum carries it out into\n  the open air, where it spreads out in all directions. Now, because it\n  spreads out in all directions its pressure falls very quickly to\n  nearly atmospheric pressure (the air outside is at atmospheric\n  pressure). However, it still has the momentum to travel away from the\n  end of the pipe. Consequently, it creates a little suction: the air\n  following behind it in the tube is sucked out (a little like the air\n  that is sucked behind a speeding truck).</p>\n  \n  <p>Now a suction at the end of the tube draws air from further up the\n  tube, and that in turn draws air from further up the tube and so on.\n  So the result is that a pulse of high pressure air travelling down the\n  tube is reflected as a pulse of low pressure air travelling up the\n  tube. We say that the pressure wave has been reflected at the open\n  end, with a change in phase of 180\u00b0.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For a more formal treatment of reflections at an open end, see <a href=\"http://www.animations.physics.unsw.edu.au/jw/compliance-inertance-impedance.htm#ref\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this</a>. Let me know if I can make myself more clear on any point.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Addendum</strong>: A derivation of the two wave equations.</p>\n\n<p>The acoustic pressure is the local pressure deviation from the ambient, that is:</p>\n\n<p>$$p(x,y)=P(x,t)- p_a$$</p>\n\n<p>where $p_a$ is the ambient air pressure, and $P(x,t)$ is the absolute pressure. In this situation, Hooke's law states that</p>\n\n<p>$$p=-B \\frac {\\partial \u03be}{\\partial x}$$</p>\n\n<p>where the constant $B$ is the bulk modulus of air (i. e., air's resistance to uniform compression). Newton\u2019s second law of motion implies that</p>\n\n<p>$$\\frac {\\partial p}{\\partial x} = - p_a \\frac{\\partial^2 \u03be}{\\partial t^2}$$</p>\n\n<p>Combining these equations, we get</p>\n\n<p>$$\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2}=\\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial t^2}$$</p>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<p>$$\\frac{\\partial^2 \u03be}{\\partial x^2}=\\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 \u03be}{\\partial t^2}$$</p>\n\n<p>where $c = \\sqrt{B/{\\rho}}$ (from Newton-Laplace equation), $\\rho$ being air density. Source of this derivation: <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0521619998\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Dave Benson's <em>Music: A Mathematical Offering</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Later addendum</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>As @knzhou pointed out in his answer, it should be mentioned that for an open end, $p = 0$ is really only an approximation, because the volume of air just outside of the tube is not infinite. However, you can make a more accurate representation of the actual tube by working in terms of an <strong>effective length</strong>, which is a little longer than the geometrical end. This diagram shows the effective length for the fundamental vibrational mode of a flute:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fv0Df.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fv0Df.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The <strong>end correction</strong> is the amount by which the effective length exceeds the actual length, and under normal conditions it is usually somewhere around three fifths of the width of the tube.</p>\n\n<p>Also, one could wonder what is actually happening at the boundary between the tube and the open air. All I know is that if inside the tube there is a plane wave, and when the displacement wave exits and propagates externally, it becomes a spherical one, then there must be some complicated effect going on between the two (as was suggested by @docscience in the comments). Perhaps a more knowledgeable person can explain it to us.</p>\n"

The reason atomic states decay is because they are coupled to photon states, and the combined photon-atom Hamiltonian doesn't have excited atom eigenstates.</p>\n\n<p>When you have an atom in a box of mirrors, there are true eigenstates of the combined photon-atom system inside the box. These are states where a quantum of energy is absorbed by the atom, remitted into the box, in a steady way, so that it is sometimes in the atom, sometimes in the photons of the box. But when you make the box big, the energy will be in the photons nearly all the time, and the atom will be in its ground state, just because there are infinitely many more photon states than atomic states. In the limit of no box, the excited atomic states are never true eigenstates, they always decay into photons irreversibly. This process was described by Fermi, and the rate of irreversible decay is given by Fermi's golden rule.</p>\n\n<p>For atoms and radiation, the coupling is mostly by a term in the Hamiltonian equal to $p\\cdot A(x)$, where p is the momentum of the electron and A is the vector potential at the position of the electron, plus a direct two-photon term $A(x)^2$ which you can usually ignore. You evaluate the transition by expanding A in plane waves, the coefficients of which are photon creation operators, and approximating the exponential of the X operator by the first two terms of a Taylor expansion. This is called the dipole approximation.</p>\n\n<p>The resulting Hamiltonian describes transitions between the pure atom stationary states into states of the atom plus a photon, and for long times, the transitions conserve energy, so that the outgoing photon carries the energy difference that is lost by the decay. The dipole approximation is essentially exact for transitions which are dipole-allowed because the atomic motion is nonrelativistic, so that the wavelength of the light is enormous compared to the atom. The result is that there are small matrix elements for transitions between the states, accompanied by creating one photon, and these give the dipole atomic transitions. This is worked out in Sakurai's book, among others.</p>\n"

Ultimately though, as I understand it, the climate issues will require not just less carbon (and similar) output, but also carbon capture on a large scale.

But all of these objects orbit a center point.</p>\n\n<p>If the universe has no center point, what can galaxies orbit? Each other? In some cases, this is true. The Milky Way is orbited by some smaller \"satellite\" dwarf galaxies, such as the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Andromeda, a nearby spiral galaxy, also has these satellites. But do the Milky Way and Andromeda orbit anything? No.</p>\n\n<p>The Milky Way and Andromeda are part of the Local Group, our local galaxy cluster. They are gravitationally bound to each other. There is a center of mass in the Local Group, just as there is in a stellar system. But in the Local Group, the Milky Way and Andromeda are actually coming towards each other. A collision, and eventual merger, between the two, is expected to happen billions of years in the future.</p>\n\n<p>On a larger scale, the Local Group is part of the Virgo Supercluster. It contains many other galaxy clusters. It, too, has a center of mass. But all the galaxy clusters are not \"orbiting\" this center of mass.

Those other lumps are the two resistors and the bulb (we treat the bulb as just another resistor) so the 9 volts must be divided up between the resistors.</p>\n<h1>A longer answer:</h1>\n<p>Faraday's law, which is one of Maxwell's four fundamental equations of electromagnetism, states that the integral of the electric field around a circuit must be equal to the change in magnetic flux through the circuit.</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$\\oint{\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Phi_B}}{\\mathrm{d}t}$</span></p>\n<p>This result was arrived at by experimental observation but is essentially consistent with later theory (e.g. quantum electrodynamics).</p>\n<p>In a circuit with a battery, resistors, and a bulb, in which the current has been running more than a few seconds, there is negligible change in magnetic flux and so the integral of the electric field around the circuit roughly zero:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$\\oint{\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell} \\approx 0$</span></p>\n<p>The integral of the electric field between two points <span class=\"math-container\">$a$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$b$</span> is <span class=\"math-container\">$V_{a,b}=-\\int^b_a\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell$</span> (there are other expressions but this is common and arises from the work required to move an electric charge in the field). You know this better as the <em>voltage</em> between points <span class=\"math-container\">$a$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$b$</span>.</p>\n<p>We chop up the circuit into lumps -- a resistor from point <span class=\"math-container\">$a$</span> to point <span class=\"math-container\">$b$</span>, another resistor from <span class=\"math-container\">$c$</span> to <span class=\"math-container\">$d$</span>, a bulb from <span class=\"math-container\">$e$</span> to <span class=\"math-container\">$f$</span>, a battery from <span class=\"math-container\">$g$</span> to <span class=\"math-container\">$h$</span>, wires.</p>\n<p>We measure the voltage across each lump -- <span class=\"math-container\">$V_{a,b}$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\">$V_{c,d}$</span>, and so on -- and add the voltages up:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$V_{a,b}+V_{c,d}+V{e,f}+V{g,h} = \\int^a_b\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell +\n \\int^c_d\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell+ \\int^e_f\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell+ \\int^g_h\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell$</span>.</p>\n<p>But the sum of all the electric field integrals for each lump are equal to the\nelectric field integral around the whole loop</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$\\int^a_b\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell +\n \\int^c_d\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell+ \\int^e_f\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell+ \\int^g_h\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell =  \\oint\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\ell =0$</span></p>\n<p>because the loop is made up of the lumps</p>\n<p>We assume the battery voltage is fixed at 9 volts.  (In truth it is slowly declining but over the time that we are measuring it's not going to be noticeable).  So the voltages across the other components have to add up to -9 volts.</p>\n<p>We also assume that the voltage in the wires is zero.  This is not completely accurate but the voltage drop across a copper wire in a circuit like the one in your example will be fairly tiny.</p>\n<p>All we have left now are the resistors and the bulb.  The bulb acts more or less like a resistor too, once the circuit has been running for a while.  (While it is heating up it isn't quite like a normal resistor but once it has reached a steady temperature it is).  So the 9 volts must be divided up between the resistors.</p>\n<p>Making this quantitative using your example...</p>\n<p>The voltage across a resistor is proportional to the current in the resistor.  This is <em>Ohm's law</em>, <span class=\"math-container\">$V=IR$</span>, another law that was the result of experimental observation.  The constant of proportionality, <span class=\"math-container\">$R$</span>, is called the <em>resistance</em>.</p>\n<p>You have three resistors in your circuit, <span class=\"math-container\">$R_1 = 10 \\Omega$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\">$R_2 = 10 \\Omega$</span>, and the unknown <span class=\"math-container\">$R_3$</span> (the bulb's resistance).  The current <span class=\"math-container\">$I$</span> flows through all of these resistors, because electrons don't escape from the circuit.  We assume that charge isn't building up in any particular part of the circuit (this is a pretty good assumption once the circuit has been running for a bit), so <span class=\"math-container\">$I$</span> is the same in all the resistors.</p>\n<p>So, using ohms law for the battery and each of the resistors you have:</p>\n<p>9 volts <span class=\"math-container\">$- IR_1 - IR_2 - IR_3 = 0$</span>.</p>\n<p>You can factor out the current:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$9V - I(R_1 + R_2 + R_3) = 0$</span></p>\n<p>and rearrange:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$I=\\frac{9V}{R_1 + R_2 + R_3}$</span>.</p>\n<p>Again applying Ohm's law the voltage across resistor 1 is:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$-V_1=-IR_1=-\\frac{9V}{R_1+R_2+R_3}R_1=-9V\\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2+R_3}$</span>.</p>\n<p>And you get similar expressions for the voltages across resistors 2 and 3.</p>\n<p>And if you add up <span class=\"math-container\">$V_1$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\">$V_2$</span>, and <span class=\"math-container\">$V_3$</span> you get -9 volts, as expected.</p>\n"

I'll also let A and B be spherical, to make them planet-like and also stable, so we don't have to worry about their shape changing.

So the gravitational force between them is:</p>\n\n<p>\\begin{equation}\nF=\\frac{G \\rho_{A} (\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r_{A}^{3})m_{B}}{(r_{a}+r_{b})^{2}}\n\\end{equation}</p>\n\n<p>It's clear that the top will grow more quickly than the bottom (everything is constant except for the radii).

When a flower blooms, the result is the exposure of the inherent color of the flower. A Spectrachrome\u00ae crystal is similar in that an energy-shift occurs causing the color of the dye to become visible to the human eye. The shifting or &quot;twisting&quot; of the dye is referred to as a molecular excitation transition. The dye does not actually &quot;change&quot; color; rather, it becomes visible to the human eye. Research shows that some animals; e.g., certain species of bats, can actually see the color of a Spectrachrome\u00ae crystal in its inactive state.</p>\n<p>WHAT WAVELENGTH CAUSES THE REACTION?</p>\n<p>Although each Spectrachrome\u00ae crystal operates at a slightly different wavelength, the optimal wavelength is 365 nanometers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which is about reasonable. Note that there doesn't need to be any particular correlation between the wavelength of light that activates a certain ink colour and the colour of that ink. Most artificial lights are pretty thin on the UV (by design - it's not something we want to be around all the time), but black lights are readily available if you want to test this experimentally.</p>\n<p>In particular, this means that the explanation in the OP,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>sunlight and artificial light have different spectrums and they pick colors that reflect only the wavelengths that are contained in sunlight but not artificial light.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>is not quite right. It's not that the spectrum of sunlight is reflected; instead, sunlight contains spectral components that 'activate' the ink so that the dye becomes visible.</p>\n"

In particular, they <em>are</em> authenticating themselves, and I think you have some confusion in terminology going on here. The fact that the auth token is in the request body doesn't change anything about authentication. Many API calls work this way (although passing the auth token in the header may be more common). If you contacted them and tried to address the lack of authentication (like you are here) I'm sure they would have dismissed your concerns, because they are in fact authenticating themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding your concerns over DDOS, the difference between getting an auth token out of a header (which is probably the only other place it can live) and parsing it out of a JSON body is very minimal from the perspective of CPU usage. I don't expect it to make any practical difference in helping an attacker succeed in a DDOS attack. In all likelihood you have much more CPU intensive pages than this anyway, so if someone were to perform a targeted attack against your system and take the time to try to find the weakest endpoint, there are probably many much more tempting pages to be found.</p>\n\n<p>However, even that isn't a real concern. Most DDOS attacks these days work by simply throwing as many requests at the target as possible to saturate their network bandwidth.  As a result, the actual endpoint doesn't even matter, and the requests the attackers send are very rarely valid requests anyway. I doubt many attackers would bother doing more than looking up the IP address of your server(s), and there are probably very few circumstances in which they would first spend time looking around your website trying to find the most vulnerable page.</p>\n\n<p>If you are concerned about DDOS get a DDOS mitigation partner like cloud flare. As Josef mentions, you can also try IP address limits on the page. However, there are much more effective ways to spend your time to protect your site against DDOS then trying to change the API structure of a third party service when your application has plenty more endpoints for an attacker to hit anyway.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Clarifications</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the security world no answers are especially helpful without good threat modeling.  As a result, it's worth breaking down the \"threat model\" you are concerned about.  Having a request that passes the auth token in the body is important <strong>if</strong>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Someone is targeting your system for DDOS attack</li>\n<li>They don't have enough bandwidth at their disposal to simply overrun your network resources (<a href=\"https://www.incapsula.com/blog/new-ddos-attack-method-demands-a-fresh-approach-to-amplification-assault-mitigation.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DDOS of network resources via amplifications attacks alone accounts for ~half of all DDOS attacks</a>)</li>\n<li>They therefore decide to target particular endpoints in your system that are resource-intensive</li>\n<li>They happen to stumble upon this unpublished endpoint and are able to figure out how the API call works</li>\n<li>They don't find another endpoint in your system that is more resource intensive</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If all of those conditions are met, then indeed, someone might use this endpoint to DDOS your system, and the difference between authentication in the header and in the body may in fact matter.  However, in case it isn't clear, <strong>these conditions are never going to be met</strong>.  If someone wants to DDOS your systems they will probably just go off and <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3180246/data-protection/hire-a-ddos-service-to-take-down-your-enemies.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rent a DDOS</a> that will flood your systems with meaningless network traffic.  It is both easier and more effective then trying to identify an actual weak point in your system.  This is the primary reason why this doesn't matter from the perspective of a DDOS: the DDOS attack you are worried about is never going to happen because there are easier and faster ways to DDOS a website than this.  The only way to protect against realistic kinds of DDOS attacks is with a DDOS mitigation provider.</p>\n\n<p>This is why threat modeling and understanding real world threats is so important.  You can spend weeks working with a third party provider to change their API in a way that minimizes CPU time on your end, only to then have your systems knocked out by a DDOS that blindly sends invalid requests into your network and overwhelms your network capacity.  If you spend your time protecting against the wrong kinds of threats, you can end up wasting a lot of time and (more importantly) implementing the wrong kinds of safe guards.</p>\n"

                "content": " <p>An <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle\" rel=\"noreferrer\">oracle</a> is an individual who knows the personal cell phone number of a god. This enables him (or her) to obtain some information which is usually considered as out of reach of mere mortals, such as glimpses of the future. In cryptography, that's the same, except that no deity is involved: an oracle is any system which can give some extra information on a system, which otherwise would not be available.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider asymmetric encryption with <a href=\"http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2125\" rel=\"noreferrer\">RSA</a>. The standard I link to states how a piece of data should be encrypted with a public key. In particular, the encryption begins with a <em>padding</em> operation, in which the piece of data is first expanded by adding a header, so that the padded data length matches the RSA public key length. The header should begin with the two bytes <code>0x00 0x02</code>, followed by at least eight random non-zero bytes, and then another <code>0x00</code>. Once the data has been padded, it is time to apply the mathematical operation which is at the core of the RSA operation (modular exponentiation). Details of the padding are important for security.</p>\n<p>The encryption result is an integer modulo the <em>RSA modulus</em>, a big integer which is part of the public key. For a 1024-bit RSA key, the modulus <em>n</em> is an integer value greater than <em>2<sup>1023</sup></em>, but smaller than <em>2<sup>1024</sup></em>. A properly encrypted data chunk, with RSA, yields an integer value between <em>1</em> and <em>n-1</em>. However, the padding implies some <em>structure</em>, as shown above. The decrypting party MUST find, upon decryption, a properly formed PKCS#1 header, beginning with the <code>0x00 0x02</code> bytes, followed by at least eight non-zero bytes, and there must be a <code>0x00</code> which marks the end of the header. Therefore, not all integers between <em>1</em> and <em>n-1</em> are valid RSA-encrypted message (less than 1 every 65000 such integers would yield a proper padding upon decryption).</p>\n<p><em>Knowing</em> whether a given integer modulo <em>n</em> would yield, upon decryption, a valid padding structure, is supposed to be infeasible for whoever does not know the private key. The private key owner (the deity) obtains that information, and much more: if the decryption works, the private key owner actually gets the message, which is the point of decryption. Assume that there <em>is</em> an entity, somewhere, who can tell you whether a given integer modulo <em>n</em> is a validly encrypted piece of data with RSA; that entity would not give you the full decryption result, it would just tell you whether decryption would work or not. That's a one-bit information, a reduced glimpse of what the deity would obtain. The entity is your oracle: it returns <em>parts</em> of the information what is normally available only to the private key owner.</p>\n<p>It <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.19.8543\" rel=\"noreferrer\">turns out</a> that, given access to such an oracle, it is possible to rebuild the private key, by sending specially crafted integers modulo <em>n</em> (it takes a million or so of such values, and quite a bit of mathematics, but it can be done). It also turns out that most <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2246\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SSL/TLS</a> implementation of that time (that was in 1999) were involuntarily acting as oracles: if you sent, as a client, an invalidly RSA-encrypted ClientKeyExchange message, the server was responding with a specific error message (&quot;duh, your ClientKeyExchange message stinks&quot;), whereas if decryption worked, the server was keeping on with the protocol, using whatever value it decrypted (usually unknown to the client if the client sent a random value, so the protocol failed later on, but the client could see the difference between a valid and an invalid padding). Therefore, with such an implementation, an attacker could (after a million or so of failed connections) rebuild the server private key, which is usually considered to be a bad thing.</p>\n<p>That's what oracles are: a mathematical description of a data leak, to be used in security proofs. In the case of RSA, this demonstrates that knowing whether a value has a proper padding or not is somehow equivalent to learning the private key (if you know the private key you can attempt the decryption and see the padding for yourself; the Bleichenbacher attack shows that it also works the other way round).</p>\n"

                "content": " <p>There are two parts to your concern about password length, the threat model and the rationale behind longer passwords.  As you state,  a lot of websites have protections against common attacks, and if the password database hasn't been leaked, your password isn't easily guessable, and online protections against brute-force protections are in place, longer passwords don't make much of a difference.  When those assumptions fail, long passwords can make sure your password is too expensive to crack, as demonstrated in research.  The more general case of this question, \"Why have strong passwords at all?\", is covered in <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/52031/why-does-password-strength-matter/52039\">this question.</a></p>\n\n<h2>Threat Model</h2>\n\n<p>The threat most password policies are concerned with is an attacker trying to crack the hash of the password which has been stolen or leaked from the system, also known as an offline attack.  This usually has some of the strictest requirements. However, these offline attacks aren't the only threat model.  You password could be compromised in other ways, like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Brute-force on the website itself, as you mentioned:  Most secure websites have protections against this, which are further discussed below. Long passwords do help you from online brute-force attacks, although the cost/attempt is much higher than an offline password cracker.  These kind of attacks are somewhat common.</li>\n<li>You reused a password and the password was compromised elsewhere:  The only prevention here is to not reuse passwords. Password length won't help here and too stringent of password requirements might even discourage users from setting a different password for each site.</li>\n<li>A friend, colleague, or social engineer is trying to guess your password based on their knowledge of you: While password length helps here, you don't need very long passwords to stop this attack, and often services are rate limited to only a few attempts per hour per computer.</li>\n<li>There are also methods like phishing, exploiting the password reset, and stealing a plaintext database. In all of those threats it doesn't matter how complicated your password is; it's gone anyways.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Focusing just on online attacks and limiting log-in attempts is bad practice because password database leaks do happen.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkj3n7/myspace-data-breach-427-million-passwords-available-online\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MySpace</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/07/adobe-password-leak-can-check\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Adobe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/31/dropbox-hack-passwords-68m-data-breach\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dropbox</a>, and others have all had password hashes stolen. You can check if you appear on any public leaks <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Don't Websites Block Online Brute-Force Attempts?</h2>\n\n<p>A major part of your question appears to be why password requirements are such a big deal if protections against brute-force attacks are in place.  PCI compliance, for example, requires account lock-out for at least 30 minutes after 6 failed attempts. The biggest problem in preventing these attacks is working against botnets with thousands of computers without causing a denial of service.  How do you prevent thousands of computers each trying to log in a few times without also locking out the user when they mistype their password while using a new computer, or using the same proxy as the botnet?</p>\n\n<p>There are other ways other than lockouts to <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/42271/how-can-you-i-detect-low-frequency-brute-forcing-over-multiple-connections\">rate-limit attackers, like asking for CAPTCHA</a>. However, there are <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448963/has-recaptcha-been-cracked-hacked-ocrd-defeated-broken/549859#549859\">some ways to work around CAPTCHA</a>.  This <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blocking_Brute_Force_Attacks\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OWASP page</a> discusses more of the best ways to block brute-force attacks.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Longer Passwords Help</h2>\n\n<p>A few decades ago when Unix was king, it was considered that five-character passwords <a href=\"https://spqr.eecs.umich.edu/courses/cs660sp11/papers/10.1.1.128.1635.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">were pretty good</a>.  Now the stakes are higher, advanced hardware is cheap, and hashes can be broken faster than ever so the requirements for good passwords are higher.  This is part of the reason more companies are pushing for longer passwords.</p>\n\n<p>Longer passwords help because the difficulty of password cracking goes up exponentially with password complexity.  <strong>Just adding one random word to your password can make it thousands of times more expensive to guess</strong>- the difference between seconds and hours of cracking time.  Adding another random word turns those hours into years.</p>\n\n<p>Many people advocate for using symbols and creating passwords from larger and larger character sets to make passwords more difficult to crack.  However, <a href=\"http://www.guanotronic.com/~serge/papers/chi11b.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">several</a> <a href=\"http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2012/papers/4681a523.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">examples</a> in <a href=\"http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2012/papers/4681a523.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">research</a> show that requiring longer passwords instead of very complex passwords leads to harder-to-crack passwords (and is more user friendly).  The longer passwords side was also famously supported by xkcd's <a href=\"https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/936:_Password_Strength\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"correct horse\" method to generate passwords</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One caveat is that longer passwords aren't always more secure since extra characters can make a password more predictable.  \"orrect horse battery staple\" is more secure than \"correct horse battery staple\", although the latter is much more memorable.  Good password meters like <a href=\"https://telepathwords.research.microsoft.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Telepathwords</a> or zxcvbn take this into account and will warn you when the extra characters are predictable.</p>\n\n<h2>How Long Should Passwords Be?</h2>\n\n<p>The specifics of how long your password has to be, and how hard it is to crack, can't be answered without knowing how your password is generated, how the password is hashed on the server, and the attacker's resources. For <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/144/how-long-should-the-password-be\">more details see this question</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I'll warn you, that password policy is a matter of opinion.  I've tried to show the best solution based on research, but there are some experts who disagree with me.</p>\n"

It might be good to know if those tests are reliable and if so, if they indeed approve of mouse movements.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Random web results:\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(computing)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(computing)</a> None of the sources seem to answer the question.

As a short example, while a compressor would usually not be able to compress the output of a simple RNG by much, observing even a few outputs might be enough to predict the next state. Similarly, if a few points describe the curve the mouse is making, one can extrapolate many of the other points. I'm not saying the source is irrelevant, but I also don't see it as (close to) conclusive evidence.</li>\n<li>Reading the comment thread after writing the above, I found it funny to see someone saying \"Estimating [unpredictability of] user mouse movement is a complicated human factors question.. there is probably some academic research on that already\". You don't say!</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It might be relevant to mention that a quick look at the Puttygen source code indicates that it seems to generates private keys <em>solely</em> based on mouse movements. It fills an array with the time of mouse movement events in the even cells and the mouse position in the odd cells, sprinkles some magic shuffling over it (shuffling memory, xoring fields), and calls some RSA/DSA/EC* key generator with the array as argument. Whether there is serious evidence that mouse movement is a good entropy source is quite important for such use-cases. Note that this is different from using it as an <em>additional</em> source, such as in the Linux kernel, which will only increase the quality even if it's a mediocre source.</p>\n\n<p>I have a hard time believing nobody ever looked into this.

                "content": " <p>I do not believe there are any research papers that describe the unpredictability of the neuromuscular system in the context of computer security and at the sample rates that are relevant, so I can't link the research papers you want. However, I <em>can</em> explain at least a few of the reasons why human movement is so stochastic and unpredictable. It all boils down to a simple fact: Living tissue is a really, really sloppy medium for information transmission. This has been known for a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392564/pdf/jphysiol01439-0123.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">very long time</a> and has constantly been a thorn in the side of computational neuroscientists and anyone trying to make mathematical models of neuron groups. Biological neural networks are terrible computers.</p>\n<p>The transmission speed of neurons varies, sometimes significantly. Even within a single neuron, the speed is variable. In addition, the number of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">action potentials</a> (electrical signals that propagate down the axon) sent in succession is dependent on the probability that microscopic ion channels will open at any given time. Additionally, muscles have a high amount of jitter. The force from a muscle does not come from a gradual increase in activity, but from discrete bunches of muscle cells, called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_unit_recruitment\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">motor units</a>, being activated. Even if we flex as hard as we can, we never activate 100% of the muscle's motor units (if we did, it could cause physical damage to the tendon). This random motor unit recruitment leads  to the twitchy vibration typical of voluntary skeletal muscles.</p>\n<p>The combination of the <em>extremely</em> stochastic behavior of neurons and the probabilistic activation of muscle cells leads to minute variable delays in timing. While these delays are imperceptible to a human, a computer ticking away at billions of times per second (yeah, I know this is actually limited by the speed of the keyboard microcontroller, among other things) quickly notices this. Millions of cycles can pass by due to the random delays intrinsic to neural transmission, and these random delays can be measured and used as a source of entropy. While we do not have any research showing exactly how many bits of entropy each action potential will generate, we can make an extremely conservative guess and say that the entire process, from brain to muscle to keystroke, leaves us with around a single bit of entropy. All it takes then is a few hundred keystrokes to obtain a cryptographically significant amount of entropy.</p>\n<p>The stochastic behavior of the human brain is described quite well <a href=\"https://human-brain.org/n-brain-symbols.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (see sections 3 and 4).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Entropy from keystrokes or mouse movements thus comes from two sources:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Individual variations in people due to a unique number neurons and unique neural circuits.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Time-dependent variations in action potential transmission speed, motor unit recruitment, etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All of this results in random delays that, while irrelevant to everyday tasks, is quite visible to a computer with sometimes even sub-nanosecond temporal resolution. If we sample the time of events (not just data like mouse pointer position or key being pressed), we can safely say that it contains at least a nominal amount of entropy. After all, given all this stochastic randomness, it should become obvious that it is impossible to guess, within nanoseconds, how long it will take a signal originating in our brain to trigger a muscle to contract to depress a key.</p>\n<p>However, it's important to know that it's easy to get entropy collection wrong. You can't just sample mouse movement and use system time as a clock. You need to trigger the sampling <em>immediately</em> when the event occurs. This means collection must occur within the kernel, typically within an interrupt handler that is executed instantly when an interrupt occurs. Otherwise, it's very possible that predictable scheduling delays will taint the collected entropy. After all, what's the good of a random keypress event if it's buffered as soon as it occurs and is only released to userspace in predictable intervals? You should always leave entropy collection to the OS itself.</p>\n"

This means: if the company's main purpose is to deliver Software as a Service to it's customers, the processes relevant to deliver it are more important than others. Not as relevant are processes like accounting. To determine which services products are the most relevant for the company, you can take a lot of criteria into consideration:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How much revenue is created by the service / product and how big would be the loss in case of malfunction?</li>\n<li>How long can the service fail / malfunction until it becomes a problem for the company?</li>\n<li>How big would the impact of a malfunction of the service / product be to the reputation of the company or existing contracts (SLAs)?</li>\n<li>How big would be the impact on the environment / well-being of others?</li>\n<li>...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Standards that could help you are for example: ISO 22313 and ISO 22301</p>\n\n<p><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong>\nRisk assessment is kinda the sum of: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Risk identification: what things cold negatively impact the assets of the company (e.g.: fire could harm the hardware in the data center, a pandemic would result in a loss of human resources, the malfunction of a virtual cluster could result in an inability to deliver service x)</li>\n<li>Risk analysis: after identifying the risks you evaluate the likelihood and possible consequences of each one. This can happen via a qualitative, semi-qualitative or quantitative way. </li>\n<li>Risk evaluation: you check the risks you analysed before against the risk appetite of the company and generate a prioritized list to define which risks you work on (reduce) first. </li>\n<li>After this step risk treatment would be next.  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Standard that could help would maybe be ISO 27005</p>\n\n<p><strong>Main differences</strong>\n - The goal of the BIA is to identify the most critical services / products\n - Risk assessment isn't limited to just critical services / products but to the whole company.

Obviously, there's a threat of people uploading malicious code. So what we have recently done is have the code be executed behind a <code>runas</code> command on a user with little privileges. It seems to work, but then again what do we know?</p>\n\n<p>Now my instructor wants us to go forward and put our project online, available to the internet. I worry that our project is likely insecure, and that us students are not qualified to assess the program's security.</p>\n\n<p>Would a simple <code>runas</code>-based \"security\" system be sufficient, or should we hold off on putting it online?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: to clarify, the way it works is that people upload programs to our server, which then executes it locally and displays the results.

I publish the workflow and everything works properly.</p>\n\n<p>The Problem:\nEvery few months the workflow suddenly stops generating the print link.  When I investigate I can see that the workflow isn't trying to run (i.e. It doesn't say \"Cancelled\" or \"Failed\" or \"Complete\" in the Workflow execution column of the list ... the column is just blank.  Similarly the workflow history list doesn't get any entries when I add items to the list either.)  So I open up Designer and check the workflow and it says it is still bound to Create and Change.  However, the only way to fix the workflow is to publish it again.</p>\n\n<p>The Question: I'm at my wits end to try and troubleshoot this problem.  Has anybody encountered anything similar?  Does anybody have any suggestions as to how I might troubleshoot this?  (I should probably mention that I don't have server access to this farm, so I'm restricted to things I can accomplish through Designer, CSOM, and the web UI)</p>\n\n<p>Help me StackExchange ... you're my only hope!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: \nHere is exactly what the workflow does...</p>\n\n<p>Step 1</p>\n\n<p>Set Variable: url to /site/restOfPath/ListName/PrintView.aspx?ID=[%Current Item:ID%], print</p>\n\n<p>then Update item in Current Item (to set column printLink = Variable: url, where the printLink column is of type HyperLink)</p>\n\n<p>...that's all.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

It's simple enough to create a variable for the path to insert into the filter, but when it comes to the username, passing a variable in its place does not seem to work using any method I have tried. CAML (or at least the pseudo-CAML used in filters) likes the user's name to actually be the name <strong>field</strong> (in this case, pulled from AD) not the <strong>account</strong> name. So after a little playing around I figured out how to turn that into a variable to pass into the filter like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>string userName = vUser.Name;\nstring oFilter = (\"&lt;Query&gt;&lt;And&gt;&lt;Or&gt;&lt;Eq&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='ItemFullUrl'/&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + fullPath + \"&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Eq&gt;&lt;BeginsWith&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='ItemFullUrl'/&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + fullPath + \"/&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/BeginsWith&gt;&lt;/Or&gt;&lt;Neq&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + userName + \"&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='Editor/New'/&gt;&lt;/Neq&gt;&lt;/And&gt;&lt;/Query&gt;)\");\noAlert.Filter = oFilter;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The user.Name property outputs a name that matches the format in the CAML filter of a working alert I examined. If I type the name directly into the filter it works fine, but when I try to pass it as a variable it breaks, even if I explicitly set the variable to \"User Name\".</p>\n\n<p>Is there some part of how the filter/string works that I'm not accounting for? Every search I've done online has said this method should work, in theory. My goal is simply to make the alert apply only to changes made by other users, is there perhaps another way to accomplish that?</p>\n\n<p>Any advice is greatly appreciated!</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

I <em>think</em> I'll have fewer models than combinations of interfaces.

So I have a lot of models that have fields/methods that don't pertain to them. For example Truck has an <code>isConvertibleTopDown</code> method that always returns \"false\". </p></li>\n<li><p>There is more to <code>Hybrid</code> than just isInHybridMode.

The user story format is not the only way to capture needs, wants, and expectations for a system. There are different ways to split and decompose user stories, but a user story should be about a user. One approach may be to split the user story into smaller tasks, but deliver the whole user story. Another approach may be to identify buildable, testable, deliverable, and deployable units of work, even if they aren't visible to the user and treat these as enablement work.</p>\n\n<p>You should be to identify who the actor(s) are. In this case, the thing that interacts with your APIs is an external system. I would start by capturing the things that you want external systems (your partner apps) to be able to do - the things that you want them to be able to query or read, update, delete, and create. You can express these as user stories, if you choose to, but alternative formats can also be considered.</p>\n\n<p>Once you know what things you want to expose behind an API, you can start to refine and decompose. Maybe some of the exposed things are long running tasks that can't be completed in real time and you'll need to build queuing and processing workers. Maybe you need to handle authentication and authorization. Some of these may be discretely buildable and testable and should be work that you define and capture while others are done as part of exposing a new API endpoint.</p>\n"

It has Direct access control (DAC) masquerading as Role-based access control (RBAC). </p>\n\n<p>For anonymization purposes, let's call the main unit of information stored in my application a Document, and the roles in the company a Boss, a Grunt and a C-level executive. There are also Externals (e.g. somebody working for a business partner of ours). The general guideline is that everybody but externals should be able to read all documents, C-level execs can write everything, Bosses can write the Documents belonging to their own department, and Grunts can only write Documents personally assigned to them. Fairly standard thus far. </p>\n\n<p>But what users actually want is that they can make arbitrary exceptions to the above. They want that any person in the system can be granted write access to any Document, and that Externals can be granted Read access to any document. (Actually, it is more complicated than that, with more roles and finer granularity of permissions, including management of who can propagate which permission to others, but the above description illustrates the core of the problem well enough). So what I have is basically permissions on a personal level, and the roles are only a convenient way of having default settings for the personal-level permissions when a user or a Document is added to the system, instead of having somebody fill out a whole row or column in an access control matrix by hand. </p>\n\n<p>Now I have already designed a Permissions table in my database, which has a User FK, Document FK and columns for the different types of permissions. What I am not sure is what I should save in the table. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Alternative 1: I save all permissions in this table (pure DAC) and have the logic tier mimic a RBAC. E.g. when a new Boss is added, a row for each Document in the system is added to the DB, with Read permissions for all documents and Write for the Documents of her department. </li>\n<li>Alternative 2: I save the deviations from the role guidelines only. So when a new Boss is added, nothing is written to the permissions table. But when an executive gives a Boss the rights to write to a Document from a different department, then a single row is added to reflect that information. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I am not sure which alternative would be better. The first one feels closer to textbook implementation, and if a principle has made it into a textbook, then there is normally good reason to use it. But in my case, it also hurts the DRY principle - after all, if the information that a C-level exec can write to Document X is derivable from his role, writing a row with this information in the DB is redundant. </p>\n\n<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in terms of a) application performance and b) complexity of implementation? What headaches can I expect from each? </p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that 1) I don't plan to implement a full logic tier. The whole application is practically a convenient CRUD frontend to a database, so I will be doing DB queries for each page view instead of keeping a collection of Document objects in memory. (I know the advantages of a MVC pattern, but it was decided that it will be overkill for this project). 2) I am programming this in ASP .NET 4.5, so the closer I stay to roles, the more I can let the framework do the heavy lifting for me. 3) I have thought of implementing groups orthogonal to the roles to manage access, but it doesn't make sense in my case. </p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

You want to know the permissions of user X, load permissions for user X.  The advantage is in the work you'd have to do.  It's also true that it would use more database space, but I consider that a minor disadvantage that isn't really worth mentioning.</p>\n\n<p>If your client was happy micromanaging the permissions of each individual user, this is ideal.  You yourself do not have to manage the permissions, and at the same time, you allow full control to your client.</p>\n\n<p>The problem comes in when the client starts complaining about having too many users to change.  The sensible solution at this point is to give users group permissions, but modifying your current model in order to allow for groups is somewhat of a nightmare.  Not to mention that updating the permissions of a group means batch updating all users with that group.  It quickly becomes unmanageable and there is no easy way to switch permissions model.</p>\n\n<h2>Role permissions</h2>\n\n<p>I would advise you to use a role-based system.  Instead of holding all permissions for every user, have a user record point to a permissions group or NULL.  If it is NULL, have a default (undeletable) permission group that a user will inherit from if none is specified.  Clients modify a permission group directly (including the default permissions group) or the permission group that a user points to, but they remain separate entities.  In this way, they have all the individual control they had before, creating permission groups for single users if they desire it, but they can also make blanket permissions and simply assign users to it.  </p>\n\n<p>You could argue that it is slower to load, but if you make a point to cache permissions, it will only be slow in the first load.  The only true disadvantage to this approach is that it is a little trickier to implement with respect to the first approach, but considering the headaches you'd have trying to implement the second approach after already having used the first approach makes it worthwhile in my humble opinion.  </p>\n"

The project I'm working on (with 6 other persons) is a complex Java-based application that's being developed for over 5 years. The entire time we were using SVN, without branching. Now, I would like to switch to Git as I do believe Git will provide superior branching and ease some development.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, before I do switch, I have to tell you about the current workflow we're having with SVN, I have to hear opinion from people experienced with Git and to tell you what are the things I expect from Git. <em>Please</em> tell me if Git can provide the things I need the way I need them, because if I switch the entire project to Git and then it turns out I have to revert it to SVN (for any reason), I would be dead :) .</p>\n\n<p>The principle we're following with SVN is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Each team member is working on a single feature. When such feature is done, a local copy of dev's code is updated against SVN master and feature is deployed for testing. If testing by clients passed, the person developing the code pushes it to our main (and only) branch with a proper commit message that explains the feature, ticket number and so on.</p></li>\n<li><p>If, during \"update before deploying for testing\" the team member gets into conflicts, he's cherry-picking conflicting files line by line.</p></li>\n<li>When time comes that we deploy new features to production, I load the production code from a particular folder on the disk (like \"physical branch\"), I sync that code to the current state of the SVN, going class by class, reviewing committed changed and taking the code meant for that particular deploy. Usually, it happens that out of 230 classes we have in the repo (and not in production workspace) bewteen 30 and 50 classes are with conflicts because of the features we don't need on production yet. Sometimes, clients ask for the latest features <strong>before</strong> wanting some older features. If both feature they want and features they don't affect the same file, I have to manually skip some particular file from commit version number 3 to commit version number 6 <strong>without</strong> taking any changes from commits 4 or 5. Now, if another file is also affected, it happens that another file from version, say, 35, I have to update to version 40 without taking any changes done between 35 and 40.\nWith SVN, it's easy, I sync a particular file and pick only the lines of codes ignoring all others. It takes time but I am in a position to tell clients \"we'll postpone this for X days\".</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also, if two developers are working on different features that largely affect the same subsystem or big number of the same files, in order to avoid nasty conflicts and collisions I usually tell clients \"we can't develop both things in the same time, we'll postpone feature B till feature A is done and tested\" and one of the devs get to work on something else.</p>\n\n<p>Now, from Git the only thing I basically need is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Nice Windows GUI (for SVN we're using \"Subclipse\" plugin for Eclipse). I'm really not into investing a lot of time just learning or remembering how to push a branch or view the history or do something similar if it can be done with the click of a button. For me, the version control system should be just a tool - not something my devs should spend more than a day learning how to use because of CLI and advanced things we'll never use or require. With SVN we use only 4 commands: commit, update, synchronize (to see the differences) and \"history\".

Basically, put the important logic where the best people can take care of it.</p>\n<h1>Code vs. Data</h1>\n<p>Implementing a Set as a definition of what belongs in that set instead of as a container that holds things is using code instead of data.  Passing functions to other functions treats them like data.  Modeling decision-making as a tree structure treats the tree data like code.</p>\n<p>Performing processing in the database vs. a web service, vs. the &quot;back end&quot;, vs. the &quot;front end&quot;, vs. in AJAX in someone's browser is still just code operating on data, albeit in different areas of your infrastructure.  I would say rather that it blurs the responsibilities between different layers of your architecture.</p>\n<h1>Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)</h1>\n<p>Yes, the goal of ORM is supposed to let you work in your chosen language, temporarily forgetting about the storage format.  ORM succeeds when it simplifies the problems of manipulating your abstractions.  A procedure that wraps a stored procedure is just another level of abstraction.  If you don't need to think about whether or not it's backed by a stored procedure, then ORM is succeeding.</p>\n"

You can write a value to a register (e.g. to turn a pump on), or read a value from a register (e.g. to see if the pump is running). The app will have a config file detailing each register's settings, e.g. its address, whether it's 16- or 32-bit, a friendly \"alias\" (so other code can deal with \"Pump XYZ\" rather than address \"50B3D124\"), and a few other things.</p>\n\n<p>My first thought was to have a <code>Register</code> class reflecting these properties, plus <code>Read()</code> and <code>Write()</code> methods.

Using a property for this purpose doesn't feel right though.</p>\n\n<p>I then started wondering if a <code>Register</code> class was even necessary, as its read/write functionality would be doing little more than calling Read/Write methods on a <code>SystemController</code> class, e.g.</p>\n\n<pre><code>long ReadRegister(string registerAlias);\nvoid WriteRegister(string registerAlias, long value);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Why not just let the rest of the application read/write registers via the  <code>SystemController</code> class?

The only thing you should be able to do with a <code>Register</code> variable is read, write, and check if it's the same hardware register as another <code>Register</code>. For example, in Java:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public final class Register&lt;T extends Number&gt; {\n    public static final Register&lt;Short&gt; PUMP_XYZ = new Register&lt;Short&gt;(0xA3F990);\n    public static final Register&lt;Integer&gt; PUMP_ABC = new Register&lt;Integer&gt;(0xA3F9A0);\n    // and so on\n\n    private final int address;\n\n    private Register(int address) {\n        this.address = address;\n    }\n\n    public T read() throws CommunicationException {\n        return /* read hardware */\n    }\n\n    public void write(T value) throws CommunicationException {\n        /* write to hardware */\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean equals(Object other) {\n        if (other instanceof Register) {\n            return this.address == ((Register) other).address;\n        } else {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int hashCode() {\n        return address;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return String.format(\"Register(0x%h)\", address);\n    }\n\n    public static final class CommunicationException extends RuntimeException {}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is the simplest implementation that captures all the essential details of a real register. It's also immutable and disallows inheritance, both of which you should prefer when possible.</p>\n\n<p>It's tempting to attach a printable name to <code>Register</code>, but that's not really a part of what you're trying to model.

You may scetch out the API in code, you may write down some conceptual comments in natural language, or some high-level pseudo code, but you don't let the implementation details disturb your thought process. It is a top-down approach, opposed to the usual \"bottom-up\" process of TDD. </p>\n\n<p>If you start \"coding a solution first\", you will probably end up in doing no TDD at all: you take a high risk of not writing enough tests to make sure every important aspect of your solution is covered, you take a high risk of implementing things \"just in case\", though you don't need them (yet), and you don't really think about the API requirements from the viewpoint of a user of your API.</p>\n\n<p>This is actually very old wisdom: when I was in school (>30 years ago), I already learned the terms \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" as programming techniques both supporting each other. \"TDD by the book\" just covers the \"bottom-up\" aspect, the \"top-down\" aspect is introduced by explicitly doing (at least a little bit) analysis and design first.</p>\n\n<p>So yes, developing a solution first is fine, but if you want to to TDD, don't implement your solutions in code first before you start to write tests.</p>\n"

Take this as an opportunity to impress your new employers. People with a reputation for finishing work ahead of time are valuable - and in software, very rare. Let your manager know that you're free and ready to be assigned your next task.</p>\n\n<p>Alternately you may want to see if you can set up a system where you can \"pull\" work, rather than have your manager \"push\" it to you. To start with you can make sure that your manager keeps your to-do list sufficiently long that you never run out, but eventually you might want to influence the working procedures of your workplace towards a more agile approach (where your <em>team</em> has a to-do list, and you grab the item at the top when you're free).</p>\n\n<h2>Find ways to generate value yourself</h2>\n\n<p>If you think your manager will just give you make-work to get you out of their hair, or if you don't like the sound of asking for more, then why don't you look for some ways you can generate value for the company yourself? See if you can automate a build or a deployment. Introduce a tool to automatically enforce a policy usually checked by hand. There are usually thousands of things that could get done that we never get around to.</p>\n\n<p>Use your judgement, though. You're likely to want to clear this kind of thing with your manager anyway.</p>\n\n<h2>Improve your skills</h2>\n\n<p>Read a book, explore an API, dig into the source control logs of an open-source component your project uses.</p>\n\n<p>Learn about the domain you're working in. Are there any useful documents on your intranet? Regulations that it would be useful for you to understand?</p>\n\n<p>Good employers will appreciate your initiative, though you may wish to exercise caution before indulging yourself excessively.</p>\n"

                "content": " <p>The best way to prevent the race for a consultant is present a convincing business case that doesn't include a consultant.  From the business cases I've developed the main points are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Thoroughly define the problem being solved - Do not include your solution within the problem definition.  Concisely state the problem in business terms rather than technical terms.  For example \"Based on submitted bug reports customers find feature X confusing.  This confusion leads to frustration and reduces engagement in the overall product.\" is much better than \"The UI of feature X is flawed in these ways...\" because it states the problem in terms of business value.  In terms of solution ownership this shows that you understand the issue from a business perspective which is key since this is the same perspective that the decision makers will be looking from.  This will get everyone on the same page as to what the problem is from a high level.</li>\n<li>State your solution along with several other possible plans of\naction including the null case of doing nothing and state the\ncosts/benefits for each. For the above example I would go through\ndoing nothing, scrapping feature X, improving user training/help\ndocuments, reworking the UI on feature X.  This shows that you have\nlooked at the issue from several sides rather than immediately\nhopping onto your pet solution to the exclusion of all others.</li>\n<li>Show how you can effectively test if your solution eliminates the\nproblem.  This is huge in selling non-technical people on technical\nsolutions.  They want assurance that their investment is working so\nif you can give them concrete parameters and a way to measure\nsuccess.  If the definition of success is murky it is\npsychologically much harder to buy in to an idea.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My best real world example regarding going to a consultant is imagine you go to a mechanic for routine inspection.  If you hear \"Your garbles are cracked.  It's $800 to change them out.  Should I go ahead with that?\"  you are not going to be very confident in your ability to know if your money is being well spent and you may get a second opinion.  If you hear \"Your garbles are slightly cracked which could lead to your steering failing if you hit a pothole.  We could wait and see but that's risky.  I could weld across the crack for $500 but I wouldn't trust it long run.  It would be $800 to swap them out.  Swapping them out is the only way we can be sure they will hold.  What do you want me to do?\" you are going to feel more empowered to make a good decision even if the ultimate decision is the same.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note in a lot of places you are going to be fighting the culture to make headway on this.  Don't take it personally if the default answer is consultancy, just continue to work on your sales skills for selling your ideas to management.  When a decision goes against you on this remember that you may be missing pieces of the bigger picture (ie cost of failure may be higher than it generally appears due to interdependencies) or the opportunity cost for you doing this project rather than something else might be too high.</p>\n"

We were a small team of 3 people managing and developing the tools for our companies (we are the HQ). Almost 5 months ago, one of our colleagues left and since then I am having an increased number of tasks. Over these 2 years I have learned a lot and now I'm faster and more efficient at completing tasks and am able to tackle more complex matters too.</p>\n\n<h2>Salary history</h2>\n\n<p>This job was advertised as \"the minimum salary for this job is xx$\". And since before this job I've done a one year internship and it was the first \"real\" job plus the fact that it was matching perfectly with what I've done for one year and it also was what I wanted to continue with, I didn't try to negotiate this minimum offered salary out of fear of not getting the job. Fast forward 1 year later, I was waiting for the first employee appraisal in the hopes that I will be able to get a salary increase. Unfortunately, the management decided they want to change the direction in which the company is going and my boss was let go. Shortly after, we got a new boss and nobody had his appraisal that year from the department. Waited almost another year for the next appraisal, for which I have asked multiple times, over a time span of 2 months, and finally had the meeting and at the end of the meeting finally asked for a raise.</p>\n\n<p>Off-topic: The raise mentioned above is quite big in %, almost 30% but considering that even with that raise for my current experience I will be on par with the job market or even lower. I am not justifying my asked increase based on the fact that I've been doing this for over 2 years, but based on the market and what they would need to spend to replace me. I'd like to point out that I received a positive feedback in the appraisal and was told to keep up the good work.</p>\n\n<h2>Back to the salary negotiation</h2>\n\n<p>I didn't get a no from my boss for my asked raise, just that he needs to talk to HR. I was pretty happy back then because I thought that even if in the event in which I wasn't to going to get exactly what I asked for, I would be happy with even a slightly lower increase (20-25%). Now 3 months and a half passed and I have asked 4 times about the status of my request and stating that this is important to me not only due to the financial part but this would reflect how the company values me. Every time, I get more or less the same answer: still waiting for an answer from HR (my boss has a very important position in the company and probably he is not being honest as this salary increase should be very well in his power).</p>\n\n<h2>Notes:</h2>\n\n<p>This question is not about the %. As mentioned before, I didn't get a \"no\" for one second or a remark that it's too much.</p>\n\n<p>I love working here and I have spend a lot of time to learn the specifics of this company, I would like to do everything in my power to avoid leaving.</p>\n\n<p>The company is looking for months for someone to replace the colleague who left and they haven't been able to do it so far (mostly because with the set of skills asked, those people are already working as consultants and earning more). Note: the colleague which left the company, left for the same reason: asked for a raise and he got a \"no\". But at least he got an answer pretty fast...</p>\n\n<h2>Question</h2>\n\n<p>How should I continue from here? Should I try to be more pushy and ask again if he's (boss) happy with my performance and if the answer is \"yes\" then go ahead and ask firmly to have my situation finalized. Is it normal that it takes this long for an answer, or this would show a complete lack of interest for the employee? My goal is to at least get a \"no\" or a \"yes\", tired of waiting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Probably not a duplicate of \"How to approach my boss if I'm feeling underpaid\". I have already read that even before I had my first negotiation and followed the advices there to discus about my achievements and why I should I be getting a raise. Now it's a matter of done that and <strong>now what</strong>?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit nr. 2</strong>: Since I can't add a comment to Joe's answer due to the low reputation, I'll type additional info here. First of all, thank you Joe, long time reader of your answers here. My boss talked to HR for sure at least once, because there was also the discussion if they should change my contract type to have more hours included, to that HR sent back quite fast a \"no\" because I am not above a certain trigger that they are having. I know that they can't afford losing another team member because due to the specifics of the job, it takes 6 months to 1 year to get familiarized with all the custom tools and how they are built (can be faster for a fast learner). Now, I don't know why would HR drag this, the only reason I could think of, is they are first looking for a replacement for my colleague and once they have that they will say \"no\" to me.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

Is it necessary to inform him that I no longer will be performing my responsibilities as outlined in our agreement?</em></p>\n\n<p>My co-founder 'Bob' and I have a Partnership Agreement to run a small online business - a Youtube channel along with a few social media accounts. His responsibilities were research and recording audio; mine were research, video production, and running the social media accounts. Our venture has not earned any money. Bob also was my long distance relationship boyfriend.</p>\n\n<p>Bob's contribution since the beginning of the venture has been up-and-down. There were a few weeks in which he would record as per the schedule we agreed upon, and then stop after a minor setback (ie. our videos did not receive views/comments). I would ask him from time to time to return to schedule, but he asked me to stop doing so. He did, however, buy a ~$30 microphone to record, of his own volition. He never stated that he no longer wanted to be business partners. I take responsibility for being too lax in negotiating.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I kept to the video production schedule, and I have updated (and continue to update) the social media accounts everyday.</p>\n\n<p>A few months ago Bob and I broke up amicably, but did not discuss what to do with the business. I continued updating the social media accounts during that time. After about a month or so to let the steam cool, I called Bob up to say that I was still interested in running the business and if he was interested in continuing our SOLELY business partnership. He indicated that he was interested in recording again.</p>\n\n<p>The next day I found out that Bob had blocked my personal lines of contact to him.</p>\n\n<p>I have not tried contacting him since then, but I have continued to update the social media accounts. I am no longer interested in doing so, and would like to know if it would be necessary to inform Bob, who is still in a Partnership Agreement with me, that I will no longer be performing my responsibilities as outlined in the agreement. He has not blocked the business's e-mail or social media accounts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> OP here. To clarify further, as this looks to be a point of confusion, Bob has not performed his responsibilities to the business since several weeks before we broke up. All in all, thank you everyone for your responses and advice.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

The key things that employers look for in problem-solving skills are:</p>\n\n<p>1) Ability to identify a problem. This becomes null and void when it is literally given right to you a la StackExchange.</p>\n\n<p>2) Ability to assess the urgency of said problem. You can't possibly tell the consequences or lack thereof if a question goes unanswered, but this would be something you'd probably be aware of in a company situation.</p>\n\n<p>3) Ability to identify solutions and pick out the best one. This is really the only one that StackExchange is good for.</p>\n\n<p>4) Ability to safely implement said solution. It's all well and good having a good theoretical fix until your fix inadvertently knocks another service offline because you didn't think about the configuration of the system. If you aren't in a position to do this yourself (or it is otherwise unwise to), coordinating with those who can is a good substitute.</p>\n"

I have contacts that can cover my shift - feel free to contact me if that would be helpful.\"</p>\n\n<p>Don't bother explaining <em>why</em> you cannot cover the shift - your employer most likely does not care, they just care that they have to change their schedules. Offering practical help (such as help with finding a replacement) is always a good idea - no matter whether it is accepted or not.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A large part of which one's I decided to keep and which one's I cancel\n  on, is based on pay.

At that point, it does not matter, and at worst it could be seen as extortion tactics (\"pay me more, or I'll cancel on short notice\"). Everything has its place and time - and the time for discussing pay is when you are negotiating a new assignment, not when you are declining one.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I would like to keep on good terms with the agencies as possible as I\n  would like to find work with them in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By keeping it short and professional, and offering help with finding a replacement, you have done all that you can do. Maybe they will resent you for canceling a job, maybe not - but that's out of your hands, so don't worry about it.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As an aside - I just wanted to correct a common misunderstanding:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I don't want to say this is contract work as I never signed a\n  contract. As such, it is legal what I'm doing, but again I do feel bad\n  about cancelling on them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that (in most jurisdictions) <em>a contract does not need to be in writing</em>. If your boss says \"Do this work, we'll pay you X dollars\", and you say \"OK\", you have probably entered into a contract. So strictly speaking you <em>may</em> be in breach of your contract if you cancel a shift. Howver, that has little practical meaning because employers rarely bother to actually sue in such cases - but realize that from a purely legal point, they <em>could</em> do it in some cases (details vary according to specifics and jurisdiction, of course).</p>\n"
