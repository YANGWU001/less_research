    "\n\nHuman: <p>I did a campus interview two weeks ago (US universities, R1, Engineering). I was not the last candidate, so, by considering the last one, the search was closed one week ago. In the last meeting with the department chair, he said the department will select the final candidate next week and it seems they have made some decisions based on the information I have. I received an update this weekend from the department chair indicating that they are working with the dean's office and I should get an update this week. First, I interpreted this email positively in a way that probably I will be their first choice since they should keep all finalists on hold until the first candidate (assuming to be me!) signs the offer, which normally takes time (negotiation, salary, lab space, ...). So, there is no reason to notify me if I am not the first candidate.</p>\n<p>Then, I looked at this matter differently and thought maybe they already have offered another candidate and they are indeed waiting to get some approval from the dean for that person (probably the candidate has some requests). Because sometimes dean's office can approve the final candidate after a few days since it should not be a long process. I am not sure which case is more likely. I know that I should be more patient, but it is honestly difficult!</p>\n<p>So, my question is about your experience with the hiring process and its timeline.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

You get to pick your frequency</p>\n<p><strong>2nd switch:</strong> iPhone Settings app &gt; Tap your name in the top &gt; iCloud &gt; Manage Storage &gt; click &quot;Backup&quot; green icon row &gt; Click your device &gt; here you have a list of your TOTAL apps, each might save a tiny bit of settings info for each app (not the app itself), <strong>this is a packaged backup that also saves your downloaded app list (no matter if you switch off every app)</strong>. <strong>So, Here you see WhatsApp too (2nd switch) &lt;- if on, Whatsapp backup will take 2x space of your total iCloud space.</strong> As I understand, this backup can only be accessed if you restore the whole iPhone (whole package see).</p>\n<p><strong>Post-context:</strong> for years, I've turned off the 2nd switch with no problems. <strong>But ever since iOS 13, background activity is a mess for WhatsApp</strong>, and even though I have more than enough space, auto-daily WhatsApp backup is not happening. I now have the question if I can invert the switches, and still be able to access WhatsApp backup by only deleting and reinstalling the WhatsApp app, not the whole iPhone. This question arises since the packaged backup (2nd switch) for the rest of the apps (including WhatsApp) works flawlessly, daily, perfectly fine.</p>\n<p>TIP: It doesn't matter if you have iCloud Photo library on on both sections, Apple is smart about this and only backups once (only takes space one time), <strong>that's why I say WhatsApp is an inconvenient-odd outlier when it comes to both switches management.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>With all this, maybe your backup is stuck since you have a 2.5Gb WhatsApp backup to be uploaded, which (if both switches on) requires 5Gb of free space.</strong> &lt;- but in my case, not even having the double free space does the trick, auto-backup is not happening.</p>\n",

He can do <strong>all the same</strong> as the receiver. Thus the <code>original Data</code> will be exposed. How is this prevented? Is it prevented by using another pair of keys to encrypt the <code>original Data</code>? If so, how is the public key given to the receiver without being intercepted?</p>\n\n<p>I think it is dangerous <strong>to send the public key along with the message</strong>. But even if you don't send the public key along with the message, the man in the middle can still intercept the public key and keep it for later use.</p>\n\n<p>So, how to keep <strong>both</strong> confidentiality <strong>and</strong> authenticity in a public channel, and with all communications happening <strong>only</strong> on that channel?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

Is it prevented by using another pair of keys to encrypt the original Data? If so, how is the public key given to the receiver without being intercepted?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The problem of <em>key distribution</em> is fundamental. In practice this problem is solved by using a trusted third party called a Certificate Authority (CA). </p>\n\n<p>The CA is implicitly trusted (because the manufacturer installed its root certificate in your computer) and the CA can sign a web server's (e.g., google.com) certificate to prove that the certificate belongs to the web server.</p>\n\n<p>You can then verify the CA signature on the certificate. This gets rid of the MITM attack because the MITM can not obtain a signed certificate from the CA saying that the MITM is, e.g., google.com.</p>\n",

            " <p>In an ideal world, requirements must be as complete as possible, and there would be no deviation from expectations, since all expectations would be translated into requirements.</p>\n\n<p>In the real world, on the other hand, requirements are often incomplete, which makes room to unwritten expectations. Examples:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>An application takes ten minutes to do the simplest task, making it totally unusable (see the answer of David Schwartz above).</p></li>\n<li><p>An application has blue buttons, while the stakeholder hates blue and her favorite color is yellow.</p></li>\n<li><p>All user's passwords are stored in plain text and shown to everyone who goes through \"Forgot my password\" procedure.</p></li>\n<li><p>The visual design sucks.</p></li>\n<li><p>The application sends sensitive information back to the developer. The developer also has a back door access to the application, letting him to do whatever he want.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You notice that <strong>some expectations are very easily translated into requirements</strong>. For example, the first one can be verified with a simple non-functional requirement related to performance:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The loading of [...] performs 85% of the time below 500 ms. when tested on machine with the performances specified in appendix G part 2 and the load below 15% for the CPU, below 40% for memory and no active R/W disk operations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Others need not one, but several requirements</strong>. For example, the third one cannot be expressed as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The system is secure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>or:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Passwords are stored in a secure way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>since both are not the requirements: they are not precise enough and are subject to interpretation; they cannot be objectively tested. This means that you would need a requirement about the hashing algorithm, and several requirements about how \"Forgot my password\" procedure works by generating a password with a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator, then sending it by email.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Also, some expectations are close to objectiveness then others.</strong> At least, most people would agree that the fifth example illustrates something harmful: a developer doesn't have to have a full access to sensitive information, especially when he doesn't work on the project any longer. The same is not true for the point 4, and even more for the point 2: favorite color is something personal and cannot be a reasonable unwritten expectation for a project.</p>\n\n<p>The objectiveness answers your question \"[The] stakeholder could see a bug everywhere as he expected it to be like this or that..So how can I really know?\":</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>If most people would have the same expectation for the same product, then you may want to implement the expectation.</strong> If you saved all the passwords plain text, it's up to you to correct this and to support the cost of the consequences. If, on the other hand, you hashed them with SHA512, but didn't use the salt, the stakeholder wouldn't be able declare this as a bug just because she expected PBKDF2 to be used instead.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>If different people would have different opinions, then the stakeholder should have written more complete requirements</strong>, since you couldn't possibly know the taste of the stakeholder.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Note: remember to make the difference between <strong>common sense expectations</strong> and <strong>common practice expectations</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Some requirements are often omitted because they would cover a common practice, expected from any decent developer. Deviating from those practices, justifying it by the fact that there are no requirements, would be unprofessional. For example, I don't see a need to specify that a website must have no SQL Injection, unless I work with very inexperienced programmers.</p>\n\n<p>Why those requirements are omitted? Because it would be to expensive to describe everything. Do we need to tell that a web application should use HTTP? Do we need to tell that it must use a database? Or that you don't save 1 GB-length files in a RDBMS, unless you use FILESTREAM feature of Microsoft SQL Server?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Example of a common sense expectation: \"A website should be accessed from anywhere, not just from localhost.\" Well, yeah, that's what websites are for.</p></li>\n<li><p>Example of a common practice expectation: \"A website should use HTML 4, HTML 5 or XHTML.\" In fact, written from scratch HTML 3 websites are quite rare those days.</p></li>\n</ul>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Programming is a highly cerebral job, and one of the biggest problems I have is bringing my work home with me. It's so easy to do: whenever I get the chance to think, my mind naturally wanders to work-related matters. I find so many of the other things in my day rather mentally unstimulating and as they say, nature abhors a vacuum. Unfortunately, constantly thinking about work is stressing me out and I can't seem to just flip that switch at the end of the day. It's been causing me quite a bit of insomnia.</p>\n\n<p>To make matters worse, nearly all of my friends are co-workers, and many of our conversations do very little to make me forget about the week. They're fun people to be around generally, and once we've had our bitch-fest we all stop talking about work, but suffice it to say it does little to encourage me to forget about work-related matters.</p>\n\n<p>So what can I do to leave my programming projects behind me at the end of the day? Or failing that, what type of mentally stimulating activities could I do to occupy my non-work hours with (that are non-stressful and don't involve mind-altering drugs)?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

I wouldn't want to be competing against you either way! That said, the premise sentence only holds true if your long-winded hours are not affecting you during the 'official' working hours. If you get to work the following morning and think <em>\"I'll just slack off for a bit since I worked a 12-hour day yesterday\"</em>, then it's doing more trouble than its worth.</p>\n\n<p>Also, remember that your out-of-work hours is where you should be spending your time socialising and building other parts of your life. <strong>Keeping an even balance in your lifestyle and striving to take things to the next level in <em>every</em> aspect of your life is one simple way for ensuring success.</strong></p>\n",

You articulated it however much better than I would have done. \nFirst I thought it was not healthy to think of work during my free time.

Because only thinking about programming is a bit of a narrow mindset. \nFor me sports, especially cycling help me to not think about anything. When I am cycling, after some time I enter the 'zone' in which I do not think about anything and just go.

Maybe a team sport suits you better, because you will not have as much time to reflect on yourself, but have to interact with the team. </p>\n\n<p>But sports alone might not force your brain to shut out thoughts of work, so I suggest to play an instrument, because this will occupy your whole mind. Additionally you might try some meditation, but this might come hard to you if your mind is not calm enough allready, in that case you might try forms of meditation that entail some movements like tai chi. </p>\n",

Younger people tend to be more energetic and this is why, when we're passionate about things we become absorbed by our work.

It's also a known fact that a non-negligeable proportion of people that end up in mental institutes were in technical jobs.</p>\n\n<p>So a suggestion would be to take up an activity like painting, music, metal work, cheese making or whatever attracts you and with which you'd feel some sense of accomplishment.</p>\n",
            " <p>During my last project, I used to have the same problem. I was thinking about the code during my commutes to home, before going to sleep and even as I was alone in the room with my girlfriend.</p>\n<p>That's when I knew I had to stop.<br />\nI have pretty much figured it out now, and here's my advice to you.</p>\n<h2>Get Positive</h2>\n<p>First, accept that you can't just <em>stop</em> thinking about the work out of the blue. This is a <em>habit</em> you have acquired, and habits don't disappear at your immediate will.</p>\n<p>However you can start by <strong>reshaping your experience into a positive one</strong>.<br />\nConsider this example of negative thinking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don't know which database design is better. The deadline is coming next week and I feel I can't make the right decision at the moment. We can't afford to hesitate and If I fail now, I will be the one to blame.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This leads you nowhere.</p>\n<p>It may sound trivial but if you suspect you don't work well enough, or worse, procrastinate, your conscience will revenge on you. <strong>It's five times as hard to think about work when you feel like you fail at it</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you're in this kind of situation, there is something you can do about it <em>right now</em>.<br />\nEssentially, there are two points to add to your workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you have something <strong>to be proud of</strong> every evening.</li>\n<li>Make sure you have something <strong>you <em>strive</em> to work on</strong> every morning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ultimate goal of this is to <strong>switch your obsession to a positive tone</strong>. You know the feeling when you go to sleep thinking about <em>that awesome code you wrote in just about three hours that solved all the world's problems and made the bunnies happy</em>? You're still obsessed but now you've made a major and very important shift.</p>\n<h2>Get Productive</h2>\n<p>Once you're in the positive stream, you'll find it easier to effectively constrain your tasks to the working hours. Try to plan them in such way that <strong>thinking about the problems in your free time doesn't add any value</strong>. Consider this example of positive thinking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This database design problem is an interesting challenge and I'll try my best to solve it. I know I'm usually more productive in the afternoon so I'll just have some tea now and fix a couple of bugs so I can give it my full attention when I'm at my best. Before leaving, I'll evaluate my results, and if I don't make a considerable progress, next morning I will ask for some advice from the more experienced colleagues and post a question on StackOverflow as well. I'll make the final decision by tomorrow evening.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What has changed? Now you pick your challenges and organize your working time in a way that makes sense <em>to you</em>. These eight hours are not just eight hours in your life, they are <em>special</em>, and you need to take advantage of them. Specifically, you need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn these eight hours into <strong>the Perfect Time\u2122  for problem solving</strong>.</li>\n<li>Make sure that <em>physically</em> being in the office <strong>empowers you</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second point is a kind of trick you can play on yourself. Ask your company to provide you with the best hardware. Do you have <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/04/three-monitors-for-every-user.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">three monitors</a> yet? I keep my favorite teacup at work, and I just <em>love</em> my armchair. I'd never want to solve a problem without it again. Okay, I made up the armchair thingie but the point is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you learn how to get <em>really</em> productive at the office, you will see that <strong>the habit of bringing work home eventually fades because nothing really <em>justifies</em> it anymore</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Get a Life!</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a <strong>great answer by pydave</strong> that does a better job of suggesting after-job activities.<br />\nYou must <a href=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/98986/how-do-you-stop-yourself-from-bringing-work-home/99134#99134\">check it out</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, seriously.<br />\nThinking about a database late night? How about going to a club instead? Watching a movie?<br />\nIf you're not the type of person to know how to spend time, ask your friends to take you out.</p>\n<p>I can't possibly remember how many times I was initially resistant to my friends calling me somewhere and then realized what a great time it had been and how I could've easily missed it out of the passivity. Now, even when work-related thoughts are buzzing in my head, if somebody calls me in my spare time, I just say \u201cI'm in!\u201d and get going.</p>\n<p>A great relief comes when you realize <strong>you're still going to do what you love the next morning and there isn't a single reason to think about it right now</strong>. So go ahead and find something else to muse on!</p>\n<p>Even when you're in love, after some time, you stop thinking about your significant other every single hour. This would have exhausted you. Instead, you split your free hours so there is a time for her (or him), there is a time for your friends and there is a time for you to be alone. There is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't apply the same principle to work.</p>\n<p><strong>Divide and conquer!</strong></p>\n",
            " <p>I have several suggestions that seem like they would help me with this(as I am in the same boat as you). I haven't gotten around to implementing them in my own life yet because luckily/unfortunately my new job allows as much overtime as you want and pays time and a half for it, so I have been working even more than I normally would.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Exercise. This always seems to help clear my head. </li>\n<li>Learn to play an instrument. </li>\n<li>Learn a new (non-programming) language.</li>\n<li>Start a personal programming project. Ok, this one won't help to keep you from thinking about programming, but at least when you do, you will be benefiting yourself, and not your employer.

So let's talk about activities.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What kind of mentally stimulating activites do you occupy your non-work hours with?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1>Board Games</h1>\n\n<p>Many modern board games are social, mentally stimulating, and fun to play. Games like Ticket To Ride and Dominion have great strategy elements that will engage your brain and my (ungeeky and nontechnical) friends and family are always surprised how much they enjoy them. They're popular among programmers, so you may already have interested coworkers.</p>\n\n<p>I'd recommend picking one up used (from craigslist, etc...) to give it a try. There's a <a href=\"https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/\">stackexchange site</a> if you have questions about what to get, but I'll give some basic recommendations. <a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BoardGameGeek</a> is a great site for reviews and understanding the game before you buy.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9209/ticket-to-ride\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ticket To Ride</a> - Competitive game where you build transit lines between cities on a board. Simple turn system that prevents long boring turns. Despite being initially skeptical, my family members (aunts, uncles, and cousins) really enjoyed this game. It feels simple like Monopoly, but there's a great deal more strategy and the game comes to a great climax.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13/the-settlers-of-catan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Settlers of Catan</a> - The classic starter game where you build up a settlement and barter with other players. Unlike Ticket To Ride, you directly interact with other players through bartering and can team up against each other. My nontechy sister really likes this game.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dominion</a> - It comes with a big box of cards and you play with a subset so each game can be different. Some will have no interaction with other players and others will be full of attacking others. It's essentially just a large deck of cards, so it travels well. My other less techy sister really likes this game.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37111/battlestar-galactica\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Battlestar Galactica</a> - This is not a beginner's game: The theme is geeky, the rulebook is quite long (for a board game), and a single game often takes hours. But it shows what board games can offer: it's a thematic experience that pits you against your fellow players and provides a great challenge that pits you against your friends. Battlestar Galactica will draw in fans of the show and plot knowledge adds to the game, but gives no advantage. You can work with the other players as a human or deceive them as a human-disguised robot. Human/robot designation is randomly chosen, so the game tests your guile and ability to exploit your friend's naivete.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Video Games</h1>\n\n<p>If you find movies not mentally stimulating enough, some games may give you what you want. Games like Portal, Half Life, Bioshock, Assassin's Creed, Uncharted, and Deadspace (<em>there are many others, but I happened to play these recently</em>) provide an interesting narrative, but require you to provide the action. (Some of those are playable on a powerful PC, but others require a game console.) There's lots of dumb action movie style games too, but I think they appeal more specifically to people already into games because they rely on continuous small rewards (like explosions, blood, and points) for your hand-eye coordination instead of creating a desire to progress the plot.</p>\n\n<p>Many people can't handle moving an avatar with a controller and mapping what they see on their 2D TV to a 3D environment, so you could also try some 2D adventure games.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Various games from <a href=\"http://www.telltalegames.com/games\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Telltale Games</a>: Monkey Island, Back to the Future, Jurassic Park. These still have a 3D environment, but the movement for most/all of them is much simpler and can be played with a mouse.</li>\n<li>Some classic adventure games are available as freeware on <a href=\"http://www.scummvm.org/downloads/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ScummVM</a> like Beneath a Steel Sky and Flight of the Amazon Queen. They're easy to install on Linux (check your package manager). These classic games and others like Monkey Island can also be purchased in the Apple AppStore. Many of these older games have somewhat obscure puzzles, but the iOS versions have a great hint system built in.</li>\n<li>There are also some modern 2D adventure games like <a href=\"http://machinarium.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Machinarium</a> and <a href=\"http://amanita-design.net/samorost-1/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Samorost</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For shorter nonnarrative experiences that also have simple controls, here are some interesting 2D puzzle games. Some of these games have a narrative, but the puzzle elements are more important.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://2dboy.com/games.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">World of Goo</a> - Build bridges to solve puzzles. Great visual style. Only quick mouse skills required.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://store.zachtronicsindustries.com/product/spacechem\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SpaceChem</a> - Visual programming to create molecule factories.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.braid-game.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Braid</a> - A platforming game (like Mario) that provides puzzles based on warping time in various ways. Requires some hand-eye coordination, but mostly brain.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Programming</h1>\n\n<p>One of the most obvious ways to stop thinking about work is to think about an equally challenging, but completely unrelated programming problem. If just thinking about programming is causing you problems, then this might not help. But personal projects should be about improving your skills and having fun, so it shouldn't cause you anxiety. (You should be really worried if it does ;)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Try making something useful (a plugin for a tool you use).</li>\n<li>Make something fun (a where's waldo game for your child/niece/cat).</li>\n<li>Learn a new <a href=\"http://diveintopython.org/getting_to_know_python/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">language</a>.</li>\n<li>Try making an <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Android</a> app (the free SDK includes an emulator so you don't need a device).</li>\n<li>Build a <a href=\"http://www.cherrypy.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">webapp</a>.</li>\n<li>Learn a new editor (and thus write a bunch of code to really understand it).</li>\n<li>Research and answer long-unanswered Stack Overflow <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=votes\">questions</a>. : )</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Learn Something New</h1>\n\n<p>Many universities offer their <a href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">coursework online</a> that are complete with lecture videos, slides, and assignments. If not to learn something, maybe discussion of \"<a href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/brain-and-cognitive-sciences/9-22j-a-clinical-approach-to-the-human-brain-fall-2006/lecture-notes/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the rate of neurogenesis in animals</a>\" will help with your insomnia. (Maybe disengaging your brain from something that causes anxiety to something you're ambivalent about will help you sleep. I don't know anything about insomnia, but you could <a href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/brain-and-cognitive-sciences/9-01-neuroscience-and-behavior-fall-2003/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">learn about that</a> too.)</p>\n\n<p>I'd recommend that you choose courses that won't make you think about work. You could try sciences that are completely new to you and unhelpful in your career. If that feels like a waste, Psychology or Economics may be applicable to work and still different enough that you can stay focused.</p>\n\n<h1>Literature</h1>\n\n<p>Read a book. Find some fiction that will keep you interested. I prefer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Asimov</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Clarke</a> to best-selling dramas because the latter leave me depressed.</p>\n\n<p>Write a story. Plan it out like software so you actually worry about the plot arcs for your characters and engage your brain. Participate in <a href=\"http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/whatisnano\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">National Novel Writing Month</a>.</p>\n",

        "sft_target": " <p>During my last project, I used to have the same problem. I was thinking about the code during my commutes to home, before going to sleep and even as I was alone in the room with my girlfriend.</p>\n<p>That's when I knew I had to stop.<br />\nI have pretty much figured it out now, and here's my advice to you.</p>\n<h2>Get Positive</h2>\n<p>First, accept that you can't just <em>stop</em> thinking about the work out of the blue. This is a <em>habit</em> you have acquired, and habits don't disappear at your immediate will.</p>\n<p>However you can start by <strong>reshaping your experience into a positive one</strong>.<br />\nConsider this example of negative thinking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don't know which database design is better. The deadline is coming next week and I feel I can't make the right decision at the moment. We can't afford to hesitate and If I fail now, I will be the one to blame.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This leads you nowhere.</p>\n<p>It may sound trivial but if you suspect you don't work well enough, or worse, procrastinate, your conscience will revenge on you. <strong>It's five times as hard to think about work when you feel like you fail at it</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you're in this kind of situation, there is something you can do about it <em>right now</em>.<br />\nEssentially, there are two points to add to your workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you have something <strong>to be proud of</strong> every evening.</li>\n<li>Make sure you have something <strong>you <em>strive</em> to work on</strong> every morning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ultimate goal of this is to <strong>switch your obsession to a positive tone</strong>. You know the feeling when you go to sleep thinking about <em>that awesome code you wrote in just about three hours that solved all the world's problems and made the bunnies happy</em>? You're still obsessed but now you've made a major and very important shift.</p>\n<h2>Get Productive</h2>\n<p>Once you're in the positive stream, you'll find it easier to effectively constrain your tasks to the working hours. Try to plan them in such way that <strong>thinking about the problems in your free time doesn't add any value</strong>. Consider this example of positive thinking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This database design problem is an interesting challenge and I'll try my best to solve it. I know I'm usually more productive in the afternoon so I'll just have some tea now and fix a couple of bugs so I can give it my full attention when I'm at my best. Before leaving, I'll evaluate my results, and if I don't make a considerable progress, next morning I will ask for some advice from the more experienced colleagues and post a question on StackOverflow as well. I'll make the final decision by tomorrow evening.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What has changed? Now you pick your challenges and organize your working time in a way that makes sense <em>to you</em>. These eight hours are not just eight hours in your life, they are <em>special</em>, and you need to take advantage of them. Specifically, you need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn these eight hours into <strong>the Perfect Time\u2122  for problem solving</strong>.</li>\n<li>Make sure that <em>physically</em> being in the office <strong>empowers you</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second point is a kind of trick you can play on yourself. Ask your company to provide you with the best hardware. Do you have <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/04/three-monitors-for-every-user.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">three monitors</a> yet? I keep my favorite teacup at work, and I just <em>love</em> my armchair. I'd never want to solve a problem without it again. Okay, I made up the armchair thingie but the point is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you learn how to get <em>really</em> productive at the office, you will see that <strong>the habit of bringing work home eventually fades because nothing really <em>justifies</em> it anymore</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Get a Life!</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a <strong>great answer by pydave</strong> that does a better job of suggesting after-job activities.<br />\nYou must <a href=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/98986/how-do-you-stop-yourself-from-bringing-work-home/99134#99134\">check it out</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, seriously.<br />\nThinking about a database late night? How about going to a club instead? Watching a movie?<br />\nIf you're not the type of person to know how to spend time, ask your friends to take you out.</p>\n<p>I can't possibly remember how many times I was initially resistant to my friends calling me somewhere and then realized what a great time it had been and how I could've easily missed it out of the passivity. Now, even when work-related thoughts are buzzing in my head, if somebody calls me in my spare time, I just say \u201cI'm in!\u201d and get going.</p>\n<p>A great relief comes when you realize <strong>you're still going to do what you love the next morning and there isn't a single reason to think about it right now</strong>. So go ahead and find something else to muse on!</p>\n<p>Even when you're in love, after some time, you stop thinking about your significant other every single hour. This would have exhausted you. Instead, you split your free hours so there is a time for her (or him), there is a time for your friends and there is a time for you to be alone. There is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't apply the same principle to work.</p>\n<p><strong>Divide and conquer!</strong></p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p>First thing first. If you google this question, very likely you would result in bunch of hollow advice like, 'just be yourself, they are also human beings'. Or something like, 'they are more than happy to offer as long as you ask'.</p>\n<p>However, what I observe from reality is that this is totally not true. In reality, even as a capable employee of my boss, my boss would only think about me when he needs me. Other things, he doesn't care at all, and tries to cut every friendly conversation short.</p>\n<p>Soon I grow to realize the seniors just don't bother. I could be wrong, but the impression I got from numerous attempts is like, juniors are just like disposable tools for them to achieve their next great bonus or career aspiration.</p>\n<p>Maybe I'm too pessimistic, but it seems to me to be a problem. Thus, I'm seeking honest answers to how to properly network with seniors within the company (assume a large organization). I want the 0 to 1 process. But things become very difficult, as seniors judge juniors on the ground of 'what can you do for me?'.</p>\n<p>To simplify things and be very honest, the goal of networking would be for career progression. It exists, no matter how you deny it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: some people ask for rigorous definition of juniority. But as the discussion goes, it is never definite. Despite the terms 'junior' and 'senior' are always implicitly consensed, but for the sake of convenience and rigor, a one sentence assumption to facilitate discussion would be: junior is a relative term, relative to N+2 or up. Though junior is more commonly referred to those with &lt;3 years of work experience. But it would be good to see both cases discussed if possible. The focus here is the rank superiority in general.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>Short and simple answer here:</p>\n<p>Try networking at the water-cooler, in breaks or during company events and try to engage in a professional conversation with them (leave politics and similar sensitive and controversial topics out of that, maybe some tech-talk will work depending on the field you are in).</p>\n<p>In case nobody wants to connect with you professionally - you could always sign up for LinkedIn, Xing or the like and start your career-network outside of your current workplace.</p>\n<p>In regards to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot; In reality, even as a capable employee of my boss, my boss would only think about me when he needs me. Other things, he doesn't care at all, and try to cut every friendly conversation short.&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's their choice and quite common - as long as they are friendly you have to accept that. Not everyone wants to engage on a more personal level beyond what's professionally needed - and that's completely within their rights to set that boundary.</p>\n",
            " <p>What I observe in the modern workplace is that most managers do not &quot;network&quot; at all. What time they do not spend working, they spend at home with their family. Fraternizing even with close friends, much less colleagues is minimal. I host very fancy, luxurious parties frequently and have to practically drag people out of their houses to come. Sure, if the person is 25 years old and single they will come. But a 40-year old executive with 3 kids, it is like a 1% chance I can get him to come, unless there is some huge incentive or compulsion. People just aren't interested in socializing anymore. It just gets more and more isolated and insular every year.</p>\n<p>So, the bottom line here is that you are more or less wasting your energy if you want to befriend an older, married executive.</p>\n<p>The only real exception is that when there is some organized activity that the executives make time for, like fishing or hunting or something like that. Planned outings. To the extent that such outings exist, that is what you should concentrate on. You may even be able to nudge people in the company into organizing an outing.</p>\n",
            " <p>Unfortunately, you can't force people to network with you if they're more invested in their own social/professional group.</p>\n<p>There's a couple of tactics you can use to increase your visibility.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Simply be friendly - a friendly smile and a &quot;hello&quot; if you meet managers and a bit of small talk lets them get to know you a little without seeming like you're forcing yourself upon them.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Find out what they enjoy doing and parrot that behaviour.  This behaviour is more common in the USA where if you want to get in with a boss who likes golf (for example), you take up golf.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I generally stay friendly with people and every so often I find myself invited to social events.  It does help that my managers are pretty friendly open people too though.</p>\n",
            " <p>Remember that a senior manager's time is valuable, there are many demands on that time, and that unless you work in a small company, they literally do not have time to spend on just getting to know everyone.</p>\n<p>If you want to get on their radar, you need to do so on merit. Assume they will be annoyed if you waste their time, and don't bother them unless they invite input <em>and</em> you have something that is genuinely worth their time and that they are the most appropriate person to contact for.</p>\n<p>Wait for them to create opportunities -- all-hands meetings where they stay afterwards to take informal questions -- or catch them at social events they sponsor or attend where work isn't the primary focus</p>\n<p>Or, if there is an internal discussion system like Slack which they participate in, you may be able to distinguish yourself by being a valued participant there and you may be noticed. Note that I said &quot;valued&quot;, not just visible.</p>\n<p>Or, network with folks nearer your own level, which is generally much easier <em>and</em> more productive.</p>\n",
            " <p>iLuvLogix has a good answer, but missed an opportunity with their approach.</p>\n<p>If you find a common interest outside of work, you will have a better chance of having a real conversation with whomever you are trying to talk to. Generally, this works best if it's a personal interest of theirs, instead of it being work related, but you can (and probably should) start off the conversation on a work related conversation.</p>\n<p>The trick is to not make it seem like a planned speech or some formal elevator pitch. Keep it conversational and if they aren't interested, try again later. Maybe.</p>\n<p>Don't be pushy, just be friendly. Maybe they just don't have time right that second to talk about it, and maybe they'll come back to <em>you</em> about the topic. And maybe they won't.</p>\n<p>And don't be a pest. Talk to them when it seems natural to do so, rather than chasing them down at every opportunity.</p>\n<p>People have a wide variety of responses to social interaction and not all of them are great. If you've seen the original GhostBusters movie, you might remember that Janine tries to spark up a conversation with Egon soon after was she hired, but fails miserably because he doesn't really know how to respond appropriately. There may simply not be a good way to interact with some people without a significant amount of effort, and some of that effort may not be welcome, so definitely pick and choose the appropriate people to try to talk to. This feeds into the last paragraph of iLuvLogix 's answer, which I totally agree with.</p>\n",
            " <p>If you want to socialize, then find social events at work to attend. Does your company have</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Employee events? Things like summer picnic, Christmas party.</li>\n<li>Charity work. There might be a fund raising for a &quot;5k walk for ____&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These kinds of events don't run themselves, and volunteering is a good way to interact with people.</p>\n<p>If you work for a souless kind of corporation, maybe you can lead some small events. A potluck lunch. A fantasy sports league (months worth of small talk right here). A halloween office decoration contest.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>If you want to network, I would search for &quot;problems&quot; to work on(*). This depends on your skillset, and the industry you work in.</p>\n<p>Do you interface with other departments? Are you aware of any direct &quot;friction&quot; that causes inefficency? Perhaps your supervisor isn't so keen on small talk, but maybe topics of a more &quot;corporate&quot; interest are easier to converse on. Ideally, this is more productive than just complaining about something.</p>\n<p>Some companies have small amounts of funds allocated to &quot;business development&quot; or small R&amp;D type projects. Such projects often would benefit from additional help. This is a good way to meet peers with unrelated skills, but also networking with superiors.</p>\n<p>Do you have relevant skills that your peers do not, or more experience in some area? Leading a &quot;lunch and learn&quot; event could be beneficial where you talk about a specific technology.</p>\n<p>Do you have IT/programming skills? I guarantee there are higherups that spend too much time on a simple task that coule be automated by a simple script (beware (*)). Something that helped my current career was working on a problem several senior managers were dealing with.</p>\n<p>Do you have annual performance reviews? Maybe you and your supervisor can define a small (*) extra goal that touches on the above concepts. This also provides justification for further discussion (status repotrs, clarification on goals/requirements, etc).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(*) Budget your time accordingly, probably outside of your normal working hours. Some of these tasks you will be compensated for, some you will not. This may or may not ever pay off. In your situation, perhaps corporate recognition has intrinsic value. Set a personal limit on your &quot;risk tolerance&quot; and how long you are willing to wait for any payoff.</p>\n",
            " <p>The same way you make conversation with anyone else: you find out what their hobbies and interests are and look for overlap with your own. I ran into a senior manager for my company at the airport gate when we were both flying home after a company event. Didn't even <em>know</em> he was a senior manager at my company, but noticed that he had some boat-related paraphernalia, and I like sailing, so I struck up a conversation. Of course during the course of the conversation realized who he was, we talked shop a bit.</p>\n<p>Did I get any tangible benefit? Not immediately. But that wasn't the goal: I was just making the best of the situation I found myself in. Now, at least to that particular individual, my face is not a blank one in a mass of peons, but instead &quot;that guy I met at the airport and talked about sailing and yachts with&quot;. You are almost certainly <strong>not</strong> going to have some &quot;big break&quot; moment where a senior manager &quot;discovers&quot; you and you finally get all the recognition you crave and you feel your talent deserves. You get there by being a competent affable self-promoter who gets **** done and doesn't let anyone forget it.</p>\n<p>It helps to genuinely like people. Or to be a scheming Machiavellian sociopath. The first one is easier for me, YMMV.</p>\n",
            " <p>Personally, I feel like 'networking' as a career move should be retired.</p>\n<p>Unless you're in sales and relationships are your business, networking can be overrated.</p>\n<p>As more companies focus on technology and automation, TedTalk style presentations seem to garner more internal respect than generic water cooler conversations. Leaders and managers have to be webinar mastercrafters.</p>\n<p>If your company does regular meetings with employee-led agendas, consider proposing a talk on a new technology or process that you or your team have found successful. Or if you're more on the business side of things, create a case-study on one of your clients.</p>\n<p>Managers love this kind of stuff and will gladly work with employees to demonstrate team wins.</p>\n",
            " <p>I had a former boss who I approached during a 1 on 1 with &quot;So... how exactly do we get you promoted because I'm trying to make more money&quot; which he thought was very funny (given how most people try to warm up at the water cooler /make it professional etc...) but ultimately led to a very constructive relationship and getting myself on a management track.</p>\n<p>It's not the fact that I made a joke that mattered here (although it helped), its the fact that it was direct. I have found in general with being this direct that it's either a home run or an instant strike out. With a lot more strikeouts than homeruns (although the ratio can improve with practice). You probably shouldn't practice on your boss first thing until you feel like you know how to build good rapport.</p>\n<p>I would start by finding semi-distant leadership and directly asking them (and being honest about it) &quot;hey I think what you do is cool, what kinds of problems could I work on to learn more about this area&quot;, or if you already know that you have some good skills you can directly ask &quot;hey I think what you do is cool, I was thinking about problem X in your area and had an idea, would this be useful for us to pursue?&quot;</p>\n<p>You can also say &quot;hey what can I do for you that would helpful to you&quot;. Expect more rejections at connections than acceptances but at some point someone might say &quot;Well look, we have &quot;hard problem x&quot; if you can make some progress on it that would be useful&quot; and then you go do your homework and come back with a prototype/collection of ideas etc... and mentorship starts there.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind: having a mentor IS NOT THE SAME as having a sponsor. A sponsor is someone who takes a great liking of you and believes your success/failure to be their own success/failure. It's possible to find mentors easily using the above strategies, but finding sponsors requires you to actually convince someone &quot;I am worth investing in, investing time in me will be a greater reward than saving that time/investing it in someone else&quot;. Finding a sponsor is difficult, it requires you to actually be a good investment (or at least have the appearance of being a good investment but the facade can only last so long).</p>\n<p>And at some point to move up in management/career you need to have sponsors and not merely mentors.</p>\n"

Other things, he doesn't care at all, and try to cut every friendly conversation short.&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's their choice and quite common - as long as they are friendly you have to accept that. Not everyone wants to engage on a more personal level beyond what's professionally needed - and that's completely within their rights to set that boundary.</p>\n",
        "rejected_target": " <p>I had a former boss who I approached during a 1 on 1 with &quot;So... how exactly do we get you promoted because I'm trying to make more money&quot; which he thought was very funny (given how most people try to warm up at the water cooler /make it professional etc...) but ultimately led to a very constructive relationship and getting myself on a management track.</p>\n<p>It's not the fact that I made a joke that mattered here (although it helped), its the fact that it was direct. I have found in general with being this direct that it's either a home run or an instant strike out. With a lot more strikeouts than homeruns (although the ratio can improve with practice). You probably shouldn't practice on your boss first thing until you feel like you know how to build good rapport.</p>\n<p>I would start by finding semi-distant leadership and directly asking them (and being honest about it) &quot;hey I think what you do is cool, what kinds of problems could I work on to learn more about this area&quot;, or if you already know that you have some good skills you can directly ask &quot;hey I think what you do is cool, I was thinking about problem X in your area and had an idea, would this be useful for us to pursue?&quot;</p>\n<p>You can also say &quot;hey what can I do for you that would helpful to you&quot;. Expect more rejections at connections than acceptances but at some point someone might say &quot;Well look, we have &quot;hard problem x&quot; if you can make some progress on it that would be useful&quot; and then you go do your homework and come back with a prototype/collection of ideas etc... and mentorship starts there.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind: having a mentor IS NOT THE SAME as having a sponsor. A sponsor is someone who takes a great liking of you and believes your success/failure to be their own success/failure. It's possible to find mentors easily using the above strategies, but finding sponsors requires you to actually convince someone &quot;I am worth investing in, investing time in me will be a greater reward than saving that time/investing it in someone else&quot;. Finding a sponsor is difficult, it requires you to actually be a good investment (or at least have the appearance of being a good investment but the facade can only last so long).</p>\n<p>And at some point to move up in management/career you need to have sponsors and not merely mentors.</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I have been working in an organization for 1 year and few months. After graduation it is my first job. After 1 year they gave me really good increment and recognized me as one of their really good employees. But I am facing an issue there and I'm not sure what to do about it.</p>\n\n<p>Issue:</p>\n\n<p>My team leader does not provide me any negative feedback or constructive criticism. If something is his opinion is not right then he does not point out that thing to me but directly informs about that to his senior, who is project manager.</p>\n\n<p>I am worried that because of this the project manager would be thinking that team lead talks to me but I do not listen to him. Once I was called by project manager and CEO to talk about my interest in the work, and I had no idea what caused those meetings. Apparently team lead had told them that I'm not interested...And project manager also asked me how are my terms with the team lead i.e. is he helpful to me...</p>\n\n<p>It was few months after this that I got a good increment. And obviously that was good feedback of team lead that contributed in that increment.</p>\n\n<p>After those meetings with manager and CEO, I really wanted to ask team lead about this that what am I doing wrong. But I did not, and recently something has happened again that instead of first talking to me, he approached project manager.</p>\n\n<p>I really want to ask team lead about this. And since he prefers to involve manager too, so I wanna talk about it to him too. But I am a straight forward person, I do not know any politics. And I do not have much professional experience. So, I'm afraid that if I'll ask them then things can get complicated for me.</p>\n\n<p>I'll also mention that I'm not a very talkative person. And usually some people think that it is difficult to talk to me because I'm very reserved. But it should not stop a team lead from talking to his subordinate...</p>\n\n<p>How can I encourage my Team Lead to give me the negative feedback directly before escalating management? Should I simply ask team lead to provide me negative feedback? Will it be wise to write it in an email and 'CC' to project manager too?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>The best thing to do would be to have a chat with your team lead. And yes, your talk to your team lead <em>should not include anything about the team lead telling your higher management about you not being interested</em>. Your question should be about your personal development where you ask him/her what you can do to improve your skills. </p>\n\n<p>The best way to prevent these kind of issues in future <em>is to make sure that your lead is comfortable talking to you about your faults</em> (or what he/she presumes are your faults). The expectation that your lead will tell you about your performance might not work out always. Hence, get him/her comfortable by initiating the communication from your side in a positive way. Take it as an opportunity to improve your skills by getting feedback from your lead. This is an interpersonal skill that will serve you well in the future.</p>\n\n<p>PS: As an afterthought, just asking someone to provide negative feedback might not work. I have been asked the same by some teammates and I find it difficult to put up with these requests. Also, shooting out an email with the manager in CC is a nice way to blow up your relations with your lead.</p>\n",
            " <p>In some companies, your team lead provides only technical leadership, such as choosing an architecture, deciding what will be in the next release, and so on. They are not your manager and are not supposed to give you a performance review.</p>\n\n<p>In these companies, the people who do give you performance reviews know that the team leads are closely connected to you (and your peers) and they can ask them \"how is user1204089 doing? How is the skill level, how is the interest level?\" Depending on what they hear from the team leader, they may talk to you and ask you how it's going or what they can do for you. This is <strong>very different</strong> from the team leader approaching them and saying \"hey, user1204089 is just not interested in the work.\" It's even possible that after observing you and talking to you they have already concluded that your team leader isn't very good about providing information about you.</p>\n\n<p>It's important that you know who in the company is assessing and reviewing you. If it's the team leader, you can take steps to make sure that the team leader tells you <strong>as well as</strong> (not instead of, this sounds like you want to get away with bad performance) the higher-ups. If it's one of the higher-ups, you can mention to this person that you'd like more frequent feedback about how you're doing, and even ask whether the team leader is a good person to go to for that feedback.</p>\n\n<p>In other companies the team lead manages you, and is responsible for making you better. Some managers, who aren't good at their jobs, try to set up other people as \"fall guys\" by whispering bad things about them. If you have such a lead, my condolences. But the good news is that your higher-ups don't appear to be fooled. They are giving you salary increases and praise. Work as directly and openly with this lead as you can. For example, you could email the team lead, cc-ing a higher-up, saying \"Ms Higher-Up mentioned today that you are worried I am not interested in learning that new database tool. I'm so sorry you got that impression. I would love to learn it. When can we meet to talk about specific steps and timing?\"</p>\n\n<p>The most important thing to do is to keep doing a good job, and to have the confidence that you are doing so. The next most important thing is open communication with everyone around you. When the higher-ups bring you in for a discussion, see it as a good thing. Hear as much as you can and make sure they know where you stand and how you feel as well. Don't get into secretive or sneaky conversations behind anyone's back. </p>\n",
