Being a naive undergraduate, I knocked on proffessor's doors, asking for a supervisor, and one of them, very generously agreed. He suggested a problem I thought was interesting and so I started the research. I originally started throwing analysis at the problem, and started trying to solve some really complex differential equations (which kept me motivated). However I did not make much progress, so after my supervisor marked that I needed to get something, I fully changed my approach and started using some geometric approximations to solve the issue. This generated some results, but was too simple. I'd like to say that my results were inversely proportional to how much effort I was putting in the research.</p>\n\n<p>Time passed, I had multiple potential solutions and a way to evaluate them. On the last week before the final submission I realised there was a bug in my code base that was destroying the results (they were mathematically impossible). I tried to find the error, but the best I could do was identify an area where a mistake could have happened. </p>\n\n<p>Finally I got my evaluation on the course after presenting it. The feedback said the methods were a bit naive and could be improved on, and it was dissapointing that I didn't get numerical results (I had visual results, not numerical), however since I was not a seasoned researcher they decided to be lenient and gave me an A anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I applied to the grad program at my university, and asked the same proffessor to be my supervisor for the grad program. I am in desperate need of financial support until the grad program starts, and so my supervisor said I could do summer research for him and in the meanwhile we could discuss what the grad project could be. What he wants me to do is finish my previous work and get a publication. </p>\n\n<p>The issue is that I legitimately feel that dinking bleach would be more motivating (I am using this metaphor to convey just how much anxiety this is giving me). This research really does not appeal to me in any way or form, and the interesting part is over, all that is missing is finding the bug, which could take more than two weeks to solve and implementing a couple of modifications to make my naive methods less naive if things go well, or complete failure to finish it in the worst case.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to that I have been doing independent research simultaneously as I have been taking courses and doing everything else. Although this independent research still needs a lot of work, it's in a good place, I have already improved many of the papers I have read and have multiple ideas to explore. In an ideal world I would win the lottery tomorrow and I could just support myself while I carry on with this research.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure how to approach my supervisor and tell him I don't want to finish this research, nor how to suggest to do my research instead and get a publication out of that, or even if I should touch on this topic at all.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": "\n\nHuman: <p>I know this is a topic that some people have strong opinions about, but a toxic culture is developing in my department whereby several postdocs have convinced themselves that they are being mistreated because of extremely small -- often imaginary -- confrontations.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a postdoc encountered a senior staff member in a doorway. The staff member apparently gave her a \"funny look\", which confirmed the postdoc's view that this staff member is abusing their position of privilege. Anyone who points out that this is a total non sequitur is accused of allowing bullying to flourish. </p>\n\n<p>This situation has been building steadily over the last few years and now five or six postdocs keep a running tally of \"microaggressions\" so microscopic that it is very difficult to see how they can exist. For example, one postdoc sits with their back to a door, and a professor came in to talk to another colleague, and didn't acknowledge them. This incident was talked about for weeks as evidence of the professor's \"rudeness\". In other cases, some people are labelled \"creeps\".</p>\n\n<p>To be clear: I absolutely do not condone abuse. I know power dynamics are real, and that many minorities (of which I belong to several) experience daily microaggressions and othering. I have been on the receiving end of workplace bullying myself, and would never wish to silence real problems. I too am a postdoc, so have no additional power and gain nothing from allowing abuse to flourish.</p>\n\n<p>What worries me is that none of these incidents are being raised with any of the staff members in question. Therefore, many junior researchers have accepted as fact that their professors are horrible and selfish people. I'm concerned about this mindset, because in at least three cases, these \"selfish\" professors have some form of autism (I know this as I'm a wellness officer). Perfectly ordinary behaviour is framed as malicious.</p>\n\n<p>Personally I've found it very upsetting. Many of the people on the receiving end of this gossip are very kind, if not socially awkward, people. It scares me that so many people uncritically accept that everyone with a permanent job is some kind of bogeyman; of course, I cannot betray confidentiality by informing my colleagues that many of these incidents didn't occur and indeed it's kind of ableist to assume you can read minds all the time. Abuse and power struggles certainly can, and often do, occur... but if any of these complaints were substantial they should be raised with HR. </p>\n\n<p>The sad truth is that I think my colleagues just get their power from trash talking others, and aren't actually interested in the truth. Dissenting voices get shunned (and accused of being privileged / not being woke). Anyone who isn't in 100% agreement gets immediately shut down. But, also, my colleagues are just upsetting themselves for no reason. They're scared of encountering these \"terrifying\" professors, most of who have done nothing worse than dressing slightly shabbily and being uncomfortable with eye contact. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone have any advice on dealing with this kind of situation?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

Such problems tend to disappear when there is more interaction because people are more likely to attribute a bad interaction to 'must be having a bad day' rather than 'must be a bad person' when they know the person. Would it be possible to encourage more interaction within your department? For example, you could suggest a work-in-progress monthly session where PhD students and postdocs once a year or so talk about their work. If you have 4 people from different groups presenting, then more senior people will turn up as one of 'their' students/researchers will be presenting.</p>\n"

You can use the <code>cd</code> command to change to the appropriate directory:</p>\n\n<pre><code>cd /etc/apache2\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are several ways to edit configuration files. The easiest to learn is <code>nano</code>. You'll also probably need to use <code>sudo</code> to edit Apache's configuration. Thus:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo nano apache2.conf\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You need to change Apache's <code>DocumentRoot</code> directive (or <code>VirtualDocumentRoot</code>). Which file it is in depends on your specific configuration. I'd recommend looking first in <code>/etc/apache2/apache2.conf</code> as well as whatever may be in <code>/etc/apache2/sites-enabled</code>.</p>\n\n<p>If you search the Apache website for <code>DocumentRoot</code>, you'll find a lot of useful documentation. In general, Apache's documentation is quite good.</p>\n\n<p>After you make changes to the configuration, you'll have to restart Apache for them to take effect:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo service apache2 restart\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>EDIT</h2>\n\n<p>I just realized something important: Since when you upgraded you blindly answered each question without finding out what you were doing first, it's highly likely that you hosed your Apache configuration, and there are probably quite a few things wrong beyond this one issue. (You may have also hosed the configuration of other software on the machine, as well.) I'd recommend that you get <code>/etc/apache2</code> from backup and carefully compare the two versions to decide how to reconstruct your configuration. If you don't have backup, then you'll have a lot of fun!</p>\n\n<p>One key difference between Linux and Windows: Windows installers ask lots of pointless questions, leading to the \"next, next, next\" phenomenon. But Linux tends not to ask pointless questions. So if it asks a question, be careful how you answer it, because it is probably important.</p>\n\n<h2>EDIT 2</h2>\n\n<p>Wait a second. The files ending in <code>.dpkg-old</code> are the versions of the files pre upgrade. They should contain the correct configuration. You can probably compare them with the non-suffixed files to discover the correct configuration.</p>\n\n<p>Use the <code>diff</code> command to see the differences between two files. Use <code>nano</code> to edit a file, and <code>cp</code> to make a copy of a file (or a backup in case something goes wrong). <code>mv</code> will move or rename a file, and <code>rm</code> will permanently delete a file without confirmation and without a recycle bin. So be careful. To learn how to use a command, use <code>man</code>: e.g., <code>man diff</code>.</p>\n"

                "content": " <p>Not long ago, I myself bought a Canon scanner Lide 300. The driver installation for Lide 400 include the same steps.\nIn my first attempt to install the Linux drivers for my Canon scanner, I failed miserably multiple times. But the scanner worked flawlessly with Windows driver. Over the short period of time, trying and failing, I finally found a way to make the scanner work with Linux.\nThis is my quick guide, how to make the scanner work with Linux system(I tested it on Ubuntu 18.04)! Please, just follow the steps. Should one of the steps not work, try to do the troubleshooting suggestions.\nDO NOT continue with the next step, until the previous one is working.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1 - Scanner recognition</strong></p>\n<p>First, all necessary packages have to be installed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>sudo apt update</code></p>\n<p><code>sudo apt install sane-utils libusb-dev usbutils</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In order to recognize the connected devices via USB, you can use the command <code>lsusb</code>. The scanner from Canon can be filtered out by running:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>lsusb | grep '04a9'</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The identifier <em>04a9</em> is specific for Canon devices. If no output line is shown after execution of previous command, the device is not recognized.</p>\n<p>Troubleshooting suggestions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Check the connection between scanner and computer.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Restart the system, but be sure, that the scanner is properly connected to the computer.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The scanner make some noise adjusting the header during the system start. If that is not the case, try to plug in the scanner in a different USB slot.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you have a Windows system, try to test the USB connection by installing the scanner driver. Canon don't support Linux, but has a good implemented Windows driver.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Step 2 - Scanner identification</strong></p>\n<p>Now, you can run the command <code>lsusb</code> in your terminal and should see the\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2h066.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">output of the lsusb</a>. The yellow framed output line shows the scanner connection. By inserting the bus and device number specific to your system, you can make the request about the permission settings for the particular connection. For example, in my case the bus ID is 001 and device ID is 002. The resulting command line is based on informations about my system is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>getfacl /dev/bus/usb/001/002</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Remember to use your own connection specifications for the request!!!\nThe output of the command will show you the group, you have to join as a user. In my case, it is the group <em>lp</em>, so I join the <em>saned</em> group(scanner management group) and <em>lp</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>sudo usermod -aG saned,lp $USER</code></p>\n<p><code>sane-find-scanner</code> will recognize the scanner and show the <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/i8J3j.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">correct output</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Troubleshooting suggestions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can see the groups, you as a user are participating in, if you type in <code>cat /etc/group | grep $USER</code>. The groups <em>saned</em> and <em>lp</em> should be in the list. If not, try to execute the usermod command again.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Step 3 - Software equipment</strong></p>\n<p>Although the scanner was found, in my case, the identification of scanner by running <code>scanimage -L</code> failed. This has to do with the sane software.</p>\n<p>The suggestion from markling to use the repository(<a href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/1107632/install-canon-lide-300-400-on-ubuntu-18-04\">Install Canon LiDE 300 / 400 on Ubuntu 18.04</a>) worked for me. However, the compilation and installation of the latest sane is in my opinion the cleaner solution.</p>\n<p>As preparation, you have to install the prerequisites:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>sudo apt install build-essential libieee1284-3 gphoto2 autoconf automake libtool gettext git autopoint autoconf-archive pkg-config libjpeg-dev</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, you can enter the folder of your choice and run:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>git clone https://gitlab.com/sane-project/backends.git</code></p>\n<p><code>cd backends</code></p>\n<p><code>./autogen.sh</code></p>\n<p><code>BACKENDS=&quot;canon pixma&quot; ./configure</code></p>\n<p><code>make</code></p>\n<p><code>make install</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After the installation, you should be able to identify your scanner. The output of <code>scanimage -L</code> should look like <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YvWoj.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">that</a>. If you ran <code>scanimage -V</code>, you will get the information about the sane backend version. In my case, by compiling the newest version, the backend status changed from 1.0.27 to 1.0.29.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4 - Additional Software(optional)</strong></p>\n<p>By the way, the scan utility I like the most is SimpleScan:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>sudo apt simple-scan</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n"

One very good way of doing so is to get a Protoss partner 1-2 leagues higher than you (for example, if you're in Gold league, try to find a Diamond friend to play a custom game with you). This will allow you to play with Protoss few games in a row (otherwise, in general only 1 game from 3 will be against Protoss.</p>\n\n<p>The second thing is to try to figure out a build that works well for you and practice it in each game. I see two good choices:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>4 Barracks opening (<a href=\"http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/1_Rax_Marauder_(vs._Protoss)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1 Rax Marauder (vs. Protoss)</a>). Here is its description with some of my modifications. 9(10) supply - scout then, 11(12) Rax, 11(12) Refinery. Once the Barracks is completed, make an Orbital Command. From 1st Rax, if you have 25 gas, build a tech lab (this is very good to have). If you don't, train one marine, then make a tech lab. When the 2nd Rax is ready, you should see if the Protoss player built a cybernetic core. If so, build a tech lab for each Barracks and research concussive shell. Build mass marauders. Using this build you should have enough army to hold off/push forward with attackd. It would be reasonable after your 2nd or 3rd Rax to build a Ghost Academy. Build one or two ghosts, no more. Two should be enough. </p></li>\n<li><p>1-1-1 opening (<a href=\"http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/1Rax_1Fact_1Port\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1Rax 1Fact 1Port</a>). I can't say a lot here about this build from my own experience, but it will be more reasonable to use it on big maps or in those cases when you want to counter an opponent's Zealot push (be sure to have enough of an army to protect your wall though). Here you will want to get a quick Raven and use him to block Stalkers' shouts for a while. As a result, you will kill their army without significant losses.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Chose one of these choices (if you are not platinum/diamond I would suggest to practice the first, it will improve your micro significantly too) and try to use this build 4-6 times in order. Afterwards, look at each replay and see what are you doing wrong. In the meantime you will have your 'reflex'.</p>\n\n<p>Also, don't forget to scout, as sometime you will need to change your build depending on your opponent's actions. For example, let's say they made an early Robotics Facility. If you have a lot of marauders that means he's going to follow with Robotics Bay and some Colossus. To accomplish this, Protoss will have invested 900 minerals and 700 gas into getting their 1st Colossus with a big range. Here you have 2 options:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>get nine more marauders and push to kill the Protoss player (or at least damage him significantly), or, if you can't push,</li>\n<li>get a Starport ASAP in order to counter the Colossus.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Another idea to become familiar with Ravens is to practice 'Raven/Banshee' against Zerg. Raven protects banshee from both queens and Spore Colonies and can safely kill Queen/Drones/Extractors. This works especially well if the Zerg player expands early. In this case (from my experience), you are protected from early harassment and have some time for teching up to getting Raven/Banshee (the only precaution: don't forget about making a land army when it's crucial). In this case, usually 1 Raven is enough. </p>\n\n<p>One more thought: instead of an early Raven, you can invest in Banshee Cloaking shield. Often it work better as you can get two cloaked banshees instead of banshee+raven.</p>\n"

                "content": " <p>By no means is this an exhaustive list, but here are a few suggestions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Anyone with <strong>pure damage</strong> has an edge. Bristle tends to build his defences to maximise his damage reduction, but pure damage ignores these. He'll still get reduction from turning his back but it can still be a lot of damage going through. OD, Silencer, Timbersaw and Pudge are good examples; Enchantress tends to be a bit too squishy since Quill Spray ignores Untouchable.</li>\n<li><strong>Draining his mana</strong> can hurt him a lot in the mid-game, as he won't be able to keep Quill Spray and Warpath up for speed and damage. OD steals int in a fight and drains mana with his ult and Silencer steals int permanently (both from far enough away to avoid trouble), while KotL drains mana and limits his mobility. Lengthy <strong>silences</strong> can also help accomplish this.</li>\n<li><strong>Lowering Bristle's strength</strong> causes him to lose health without the \"damage\" being reduced. Timbersaw can do this with Whirling Death, and Slark can do it repeatedly on hit (although Slark will need to be doing well already to withstand Quill Spray).</li>\n<li>Doing <strong>damage that scales with the target's HP</strong> also ignores a lot of his tankiness. Necrophos' ult can kill Bristle from 1/4-1/2 health, depending on his facing (and often Bristle faces forward until he gets lower), saving half the effort of killing him. Doom's Infernal Blade can lead a fight well to lower Bristle's HP. AA's Ice Blast prevents his healing, but more importantly reduces the kill threshold to a percentage of his health.</li>\n<li><strong>Holding him in place</strong> or forcing him to change direction allows your team to get in front of him and deal with him. Axe and Legion Commander can force him to face them for a little (and Culling Blade doesn't care about damage reduction). Pudge or Bane both have relatively long disables that force him to stand still, allowing the team to deal damage from the front.</li>\n<li><strong>Break</strong> disables Bristleback, negating his damage reduction. Anyone who builds Silver Edge can do this (e.g. Legion), or Doom/Shadow Demon can if they have Aghanim's.</li>\n<li>To a lesser degree, <strong>stuns, slows and turn rate slows</strong> (such as Sticky Napalm) prevent Bristle from using his mobility (mostly from Warpath) to manoeuvre around a fight, allowing a team to position around him without him being able to turn his back easily.</li>\n<li>In a similar vein, being <strong>mobile</strong> lets you get in front of Bristle even if he tries to turn away. Timbersaw is good at this.</li>\n<li>Finally, <strong>armour reduction or damage amplification</strong> such as Medallion of Courage or Shadow Demon's Soul Catcher are helpful (if not a direct counter), helping to maximise any damage that does go through, despite reductions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You may have noticed a few heroes show up multiple times and have multiple features that help against Bristleback, such as Silencer and OD. Indeed, according to <a href=\"http://www.dotabuff.com/heroes/bristleback\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dotabuff</a>'s stats, Bristleback currently has the worst win rate against the following heroes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Necrophos</li>\n<li>KotL</li>\n<li>OD</li>\n<li>Silencer</li>\n<li>AA</li>\n<li>Legion Commander</li>\n<li>Timbersaw</li>\n<li>Dazzle</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As an extra note, <strong>always buy a magic wand against Bristleback</strong>. His rapid casting provides lots of charges that can really swing a lane or a fight against him.</p>\n"

I could have easilt included a way for the window size to be changed in game with a script call, but omitted it due to the fact that it would be highly inefficient and prone to errors to re-draw and configure for a different window size once the game is already running. This would be 1000 times worse if the window was resizeable using the mouse.

But until now I've never heard it referred to as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijke_tube\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rijke tube</a>. It looks like this is the mechanism I was looking for --</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The sound comes from a standing wave whose wavelength is about twice\n  the length of the tube, giving the fundamental frequency. Lord\n  Rayleigh, in his book, gave the correct explanation of how the sound\n  is stimulated.[7] The flow of air past the gauze is a combination of\n  two motions. There is a uniform upwards motion of the air due to a\n  convection current resulting from the gauze heating up the air.\n  Superimposed on this is the motion due to the sound wave.</p>\n  \n  <p>For half the vibration cycle, the air flows into the tube from both\n  ends until the pressure reaches a maximum. During the other half\n  cycle, the flow of air is outwards until the minimum pressure is\n  reached. All air flowing past the gauze is heated to the temperature\n  of the gauze and any transfer of heat to the air will increase its\n  pressure according to the gas law. As the air flows upwards past the\n  gauze most of it will already be hot because it has just come\n  downwards past the gauze during the previous half cycle. However, just\n  before the pressure maximum, a small quantity of cool air comes into\n  contact with the gauze and its pressure is suddenly increased. This\n  increases the pressure maximum, so reinforcing the vibration. During\n  the other half cycle, when the pressure is decreasing, the air above\n  the gauze is forced downwards past the gauze again. Since it is\n  already hot, no pressure change due to the gauze takes place, since\n  there is no transfer of heat. The sound wave is therefore reinforced\n  once every vibration cycle, and it quickly builds up to a very large\n  amplitude.</p>\n  \n  <p>This explains why there is no sound when the flame is heating the\n  gauze: all air flowing through the tube is heated by the flame, so\n  when it reaches the gauze, it is already hot and no pressure increase\n  takes place.</p>\n  \n  <p>When the gauze is in the upper half of the tube, there is no sound. In\n  this case, the cool air brought in from the bottom by the convection\n  current reaches the gauze towards the end of the outward vibration\n  movement. This is immediately before the pressure minimum, so a sudden\n  increase in pressure due to the heat transfer tends to cancel out the\n  sound wave instead of reinforcing it.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

The reason atomic states decay is because they are coupled to photon states, and the combined photon-atom Hamiltonian doesn't have excited atom eigenstates.</p>\n\n<p>When you have an atom in a box of mirrors, there are true eigenstates of the combined photon-atom system inside the box. These are states where a quantum of energy is absorbed by the atom, remitted into the box, in a steady way, so that it is sometimes in the atom, sometimes in the photons of the box. But when you make the box big, the energy will be in the photons nearly all the time, and the atom will be in its ground state, just because there are infinitely many more photon states than atomic states. In the limit of no box, the excited atomic states are never true eigenstates, they always decay into photons irreversibly. This process was described by Fermi, and the rate of irreversible decay is given by Fermi's golden rule.</p>\n\n<p>For atoms and radiation, the coupling is mostly by a term in the Hamiltonian equal to $p\\cdot A(x)$, where p is the momentum of the electron and A is the vector potential at the position of the electron, plus a direct two-photon term $A(x)^2$ which you can usually ignore. You evaluate the transition by expanding A in plane waves, the coefficients of which are photon creation operators, and approximating the exponential of the X operator by the first two terms of a Taylor expansion. This is called the dipole approximation.</p>\n\n<p>The resulting Hamiltonian describes transitions between the pure atom stationary states into states of the atom plus a photon, and for long times, the transitions conserve energy, so that the outgoing photon carries the energy difference that is lost by the decay. The dipole approximation is essentially exact for transitions which are dipole-allowed because the atomic motion is nonrelativistic, so that the wavelength of the light is enormous compared to the atom. The result is that there are small matrix elements for transitions between the states, accompanied by creating one photon, and these give the dipole atomic transitions.

It is in this sense that we say that a particle is defined (in terms of its mass and spin) in terms of an irreducible representation of the underlying symmetry group of the theory.</p>\n"

If n is 0 a plain passphrase (which is in general not recommended) will be used,  a  1  adds  a  salt  (which\n  should not be used) to the passphrase and a 3 (the default) iterates the whole process a number of times (see <code>--s2k-count</code>).</p>\n  \n  <p><strong><code>--s2k-count n</code></strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Specify  how  many times the passphrases mangling for symmetric encryption is repeated.  This value may range between 1024 and 65011712 inclusive.  The default is inquired\n  from gpg-agent.  Note that not all values in the 1024-65011712 range are legal and if an illegal value is selected, GnuPG will round up to the nearest legal  value.   This\n  option is only meaningful if <code>--s2k-mode</code> is set to the default of 3.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To wrap up, following options will have the same effect:</p>\n\n<pre><code>gpg --s2k-mode 3 --s2k-digest-algo SHA512 --s2k-count 10000000 --symmetric\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>--s2k-mode 3</code> is GnuPG's default (and only reasonable setting for this option); I did not include <code>--s2k-cipher-algo</code> as this is not relevant for key derivation (and not handled by the \"pre-derivation\" you described, anyway).

I have seen it be handled in two different ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The CA simply won't issue certs that outlive itself. Say you have a CA that issues 1-year certs. When the CA itself has less than a year on it they will stand up a new issuing CA. The old CA is still around for revocation checks and stuff, but no longer issues new certificates.</p></li>\n<li><p>Cross-certify the old CA with the new one so that when validating a cert issued by the old CA, it will chain to the current CA. This is a bit hacky because there is technically an expired CA in the chain. Most TLS engines do not support this kind of thing, so I have only seen it in closed environments like corporate email or ID badge systems where you have more control over the clients.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Because of the disruption of rolling over a root CA, you want it to be valid for a long time. A quick look through my browser's root certs shows 15 year certs, 20 year certs, and even some 30 year certs.</p>\n"

However, I <em>can</em> explain at least a few of the reasons why human movement is so stochastic and unpredictable. It all boils down to a simple fact: Living tissue is a really, really sloppy medium for information transmission. This has been known for a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392564/pdf/jphysiol01439-0123.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">very long time</a> and has constantly been a thorn in the side of computational neuroscientists and anyone trying to make mathematical models of neuron groups. Biological neural networks are terrible computers.</p>\n<p>The transmission speed of neurons varies, sometimes significantly. Even within a single neuron, the speed is variable. In addition, the number of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">action potentials</a> (electrical signals that propagate down the axon) sent in succession is dependent on the probability that microscopic ion channels will open at any given time. Additionally, muscles have a high amount of jitter. The force from a muscle does not come from a gradual increase in activity, but from discrete bunches of muscle cells, called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_unit_recruitment\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">motor units</a>, being activated. Even if we flex as hard as we can, we never activate 100% of the muscle's motor units (if we did, it could cause physical damage to the tendon). This random motor unit recruitment leads  to the twitchy vibration typical of voluntary skeletal muscles.</p>\n<p>The combination of the <em>extremely</em> stochastic behavior of neurons and the probabilistic activation of muscle cells leads to minute variable delays in timing. While these delays are imperceptible to a human, a computer ticking away at billions of times per second (yeah, I know this is actually limited by the speed of the keyboard microcontroller, among other things) quickly notices this. Millions of cycles can pass by due to the random delays intrinsic to neural transmission, and these random delays can be measured and used as a source of entropy. While we do not have any research showing exactly how many bits of entropy each action potential will generate, we can make an extremely conservative guess and say that the entire process, from brain to muscle to keystroke, leaves us with around a single bit of entropy. All it takes then is a few hundred keystrokes to obtain a cryptographically significant amount of entropy.</p>\n<p>The stochastic behavior of the human brain is described quite well <a href=\"https://human-brain.org/n-brain-symbols.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (see sections 3 and 4).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Entropy from keystrokes or mouse movements thus comes from two sources:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Individual variations in people due to a unique number neurons and unique neural circuits.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Time-dependent variations in action potential transmission speed, motor unit recruitment, etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All of this results in random delays that, while irrelevant to everyday tasks, is quite visible to a computer with sometimes even sub-nanosecond temporal resolution. If we sample the time of events (not just data like mouse pointer position or key being pressed), we can safely say that it contains at least a nominal amount of entropy. After all, given all this stochastic randomness, it should become obvious that it is impossible to guess, within nanoseconds, how long it will take a signal originating in our brain to trigger a muscle to contract to depress a key.</p>\n<p>However, it's important to know that it's easy to get entropy collection wrong. You can't just sample mouse movement and use system time as a clock. You need to trigger the sampling <em>immediately</em> when the event occurs. This means collection must occur within the kernel, typically within an interrupt handler that is executed instantly when an interrupt occurs. Otherwise, it's very possible that predictable scheduling delays will taint the collected entropy. After all, what's the good of a random keypress event if it's buffered as soon as it occurs and is only released to userspace in predictable intervals? You should always leave entropy collection to the OS itself.</p>\n"

This enables him (or her) to obtain some information which is usually considered as out of reach of mere mortals, such as glimpses of the future. In cryptography, that's the same, except that no deity is involved: an oracle is any system which can give some extra information on a system, which otherwise would not be available.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider asymmetric encryption with <a href=\"http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2125\" rel=\"noreferrer\">RSA</a>. The standard I link to states how a piece of data should be encrypted with a public key. In particular, the encryption begins with a <em>padding</em> operation, in which the piece of data is first expanded by adding a header, so that the padded data length matches the RSA public key length. The header should begin with the two bytes <code>0x00 0x02</code>, followed by at least eight random non-zero bytes, and then another <code>0x00</code>. Once the data has been padded, it is time to apply the mathematical operation which is at the core of the RSA operation (modular exponentiation). Details of the padding are important for security.</p>\n<p>The encryption result is an integer modulo the <em>RSA modulus</em>, a big integer which is part of the public key. For a 1024-bit RSA key, the modulus <em>n</em> is an integer value greater than <em>2<sup>1023</sup></em>, but smaller than <em>2<sup>1024</sup></em>. A properly encrypted data chunk, with RSA, yields an integer value between <em>1</em> and <em>n-1</em>. However, the padding implies some <em>structure</em>, as shown above. The decrypting party MUST find, upon decryption, a properly formed PKCS#1 header, beginning with the <code>0x00 0x02</code> bytes, followed by at least eight non-zero bytes, and there must be a <code>0x00</code> which marks the end of the header. Therefore, not all integers between <em>1</em> and <em>n-1</em> are valid RSA-encrypted message (less than 1 every 65000 such integers would yield a proper padding upon decryption).</p>\n<p><em>Knowing</em> whether a given integer modulo <em>n</em> would yield, upon decryption, a valid padding structure, is supposed to be infeasible for whoever does not know the private key. The private key owner (the deity) obtains that information, and much more: if the decryption works, the private key owner actually gets the message, which is the point of decryption. Assume that there <em>is</em> an entity, somewhere, who can tell you whether a given integer modulo <em>n</em> is a validly encrypted piece of data with RSA; that entity would not give you the full decryption result, it would just tell you whether decryption would work or not. That's a one-bit information, a reduced glimpse of what the deity would obtain. The entity is your oracle: it returns <em>parts</em> of the information what is normally available only to the private key owner.</p>\n<p>It <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.19.8543\" rel=\"noreferrer\">turns out</a> that, given access to such an oracle, it is possible to rebuild the private key, by sending specially crafted integers modulo <em>n</em> (it takes a million or so of such values, and quite a bit of mathematics, but it can be done). It also turns out that most <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2246\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SSL/TLS</a> implementation of that time (that was in 1999) were involuntarily acting as oracles: if you sent, as a client, an invalidly RSA-encrypted ClientKeyExchange message, the server was responding with a specific error message (&quot;duh, your ClientKeyExchange message stinks&quot;), whereas if decryption worked, the server was keeping on with the protocol, using whatever value it decrypted (usually unknown to the client if the client sent a random value, so the protocol failed later on, but the client could see the difference between a valid and an invalid padding). Therefore, with such an implementation, an attacker could (after a million or so of failed connections) rebuild the server private key, which is usually considered to be a bad thing.</p>\n<p>That's what oracles are: a mathematical description of a data leak, to be used in security proofs. In the case of RSA, this demonstrates that knowing whether a value has a proper padding or not is somehow equivalent to learning the private key (if you know the private key you can attempt the decryption and see the padding for yourself; the Bleichenbacher attack shows that it also works the other way round).</p>\n"

There are also automatically available metadata, such as the modified/create properties, but everything depends on how you need to filter the calendar. </p>\n\n<p>Once you have your metadata in place, filtering may begin. Filtering can be done with whichever semi-complex ajax/REST calls you'd imagine, but SharePoint has OOTB fairly well working web parts for the job. I should note that if you still decide to create a filter with e.g. a REST API call, you would need to <em>hardcode</em> the property (i.e. a column) of a calendar list item to your call.</p>\n\n<p>So what I'm saying is you could do this in a <strong>REST API call</strong> such as</p>\n\n<pre><code>$.ajax({\n    url: _spPageContextInfo.webAbsoluteUrl + \"/_api/Web/Lists/GetByTitle('Calendar')/items?$select=Title,Column3&amp;$filter=(Column eq '\"+customVariable+\"')&amp;$top=40\",\n    type: \"GET\",\n    dataType: \"json\",\n    headers: {\n        Accept: \"application/json;odata=verbose\"\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but I would suggest you to not rush into a custom code solution.</p>\n\n<p>Instead a more straight-forward implementation can be done by using the OOTB <strong>filter web parts</strong> namely <em>Choice Filter</em>, <em>Date Filter</em>, <em>Text Filter</em> or another fitting to your needs.</p>\n\n<p>Filter web parts are added to your page where the calendar's view has been added too. The web part connection is done from the filter web part's properties at the <em>Connections</em>-section by defining the Calendar in the <em>Send Filter Values To</em> selection.</p>\n\n<p>Because different filter web parts have different use cases and slightly varying usage, I should forward you to Microsoft's documentation for <a href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/connect-a-filter-web-part-to-a-list-view-web-part-on-a-classic-page-4f3f6c10-0a1b-479d-8b4d-c4f1bf49bb3f\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Connect a Filter Web Part to a List View Web Part on a classic page</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To summarize, <strong>(1)</strong> make sure you have the metadata for your filtering needs, <strong>(2)</strong> determine is there a chance you might need to change your filtering behavior - or whether you want it to be more user-driven instead of hardcoded, and finally <strong>(3)</strong> implement the solution around your need.</p>\n\n<p>The benefits of using a custom code solution are that the filtering when using ajax can be more user-friendly and it supports the \"on the fly\" behavior. The drawbacka are a more time consuming implementation and maintainability. The benefits of using OOTB web parts are the ease of setup and directly available user-driven inputs. The drawbacks with OOTB web parts are user-experience (e.g. incomplete text-filtering may not function as expected) and lack of support for more complex filter requirements.</p>\n"

This additional work, knowing that we're dealing with a math rather than bits is often necessary to avoid various errors that can occur by doing just bit math.</p>\n\n<p>Lets do some quick multiplication:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\n    int i = atoi(argv[0]);\n    int b = i &gt;&gt; 2;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\n    int i = atoi(argv[0]);\n    int d = i * 4;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Rather than going through all of this, there is one line different:</p>\n\n<pre>\n$ diff mult.s bit.s\n24c24\n&gt;    shll    $2, %eax\n---\n&lt;    sarl    $2, %eax\n</pre>\n\n<p>Here the compiler was able to identify that the math could be done with a shift, however instead of a logical shift it does a arithmetic shift.  The difference between these would be obvious if we ran these - <code>sarl</code> preserves the sign.  So that <code>-2 * 4 = -8</code> while the <code>shll</code> does not.</p>\n\n<p>Lets look at this in a quick perl script:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl\n\n$foo = 4;\nprint $foo &lt;&lt; 2, \"\\n\";\nprint $foo * 4, \"\\n\";\n\n$foo = -4;\nprint $foo &lt;&lt; 2, \"\\n\";\nprint $foo * 4, \"\\n\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Output:</p>\n\n<pre>\n16\n16\n18446744073709551600\n-16\n</pre>\n\n<p>Um... <code>-4 &lt;&lt; 2</code> is <code>18446744073709551600</code> which is not exactly what you are likely expecting when dealing with multiplication and division.  Its right, but its not integer multiplication.</p>\n\n<p>And thus be wary of premature optimization.  Let the compiler optimize for you - it knows what you're really trying to do and will likely do a better job of it, with fewer bugs.</p>\n"

Yes, I do judge SQL servers by their user interface.  <strong>Everything has a user interface.</strong>  Well, almost everything anyway.  Shells, config files, commands, log files, they all are an interface for users.  Even most linux kernel modules have some UI exposed as files in /sys and /proc.  Yes, those are user interfaces.  Just because it isn't <em>graphical</em> doesn't make it any less important.</p>\n\n<p>Example: I know Postgres is an excellent database.  I'm sad sometimes I don't use it more. I use MySQL more.  Why?  Part of it is that the shell commands are easier to use.  <code>show databases;</code> says what it does and does what it says. I looked that up once, the first time. Never did again. When I use psql, I can rarely remember. Is it <code>\\dl</code> or just <code>\\l</code>? No wait, isn't <code>\\dl</code> something else? Huh, do I really want <code>\\dn</code>? Shoot, ok, what's the command for help? <code>\\help</code>? No, that's a list of SQL commands.  Where is the list of shell commands? Ah. <code>\\?</code> has the list. WHY is <code>\\?</code> different from <code>\\help</code>?</p>\n\n<p>Yeah if I used it all the time I'd get used to it. That's not the point. The point is that well designed software shouldn't require \"getting used to.\"</p>\n\n<p>I know that seems like a silly example but it does have an effect.</p>\n"

Is it necessary to inform him that I no longer will be performing my responsibilities as outlined in our agreement?</em></p>\n\n<p>My co-founder 'Bob' and I have a Partnership Agreement to run a small online business - a Youtube channel along with a few social media accounts. His responsibilities were research and recording audio; mine were research, video production, and running the social media accounts. Our venture has not earned any money. Bob also was my long distance relationship boyfriend.</p>\n\n<p>Bob's contribution since the beginning of the venture has been up-and-down. There were a few weeks in which he would record as per the schedule we agreed upon, and then stop after a minor setback (ie. our videos did not receive views/comments). I would ask him from time to time to return to schedule, but he asked me to stop doing so. He did, however, buy a ~$30 microphone to record, of his own volition. He never stated that he no longer wanted to be business partners. I take responsibility for being too lax in negotiating.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I kept to the video production schedule, and I have updated (and continue to update) the social media accounts everyday.</p>\n\n<p>A few months ago Bob and I broke up amicably, but did not discuss what to do with the business. I continued updating the social media accounts during that time. After about a month or so to let the steam cool, I called Bob up to say that I was still interested in running the business and if he was interested in continuing our SOLELY business partnership. He indicated that he was interested in recording again.</p>\n\n<p>The next day I found out that Bob had blocked my personal lines of contact to him.</p>\n\n<p>I have not tried contacting him since then, but I have continued to update the social media accounts. I am no longer interested in doing so, and would like to know if it would be necessary to inform Bob, who is still in a Partnership Agreement with me, that I will no longer be performing my responsibilities as outlined in the agreement. He has not blocked the business's e-mail or social media accounts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> OP here. To clarify further, as this looks to be a point of confusion, Bob has not performed his responsibilities to the business since several weeks before we broke up. All in all, thank you everyone for your responses and advice.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

Usually though a resume should focus on your own skills and accomplishments and less on the people you know. An even better place to talk about your work with this person is in your cover letter.

Last year, we hired two more entry level devs.  I have no management experience or training and very few managerial duties, but by virtue of my seniority I am in a position of some authority and on paper they report to me.  Point is, calling me a terrible manager is not helpful.  I expect I am, but I want to know how to improve.</p>\n\n<p>We have a morning meeting where my team is expected to report to me their progress the past day and set goals for the new day.  I can then report to the boss (owner) what the team is up to.  The boss has repeatedly pushed to set an 8 am start for the work day, but this was unpopular and I have been able to hold our meetings to 10 am instead.  The meeting is consistently punctual.  If I call the meeting at 10:01 I consider myself late.  This is important to me since I feel that if I don't respect my own schedule why should the team?</p>\n\n<p>Lately (over the past few months), one of our team members has been consistently showing up for work later and later.  I didn't say anything since I don't want to send the message that obeying some clock is more important than getting your work done, and the employee has been consistently putting in his 40 hours a week (I can verify this, since we are required to punch a time clock).  My gut says that the quality of his work has suffered, but I do not have solid objective evidence of that.</p>\n\n<p>It has become a bit of a problem now though because he is showing up late for the morning meetings.  Once last week and now two days in a row last week.  I have asked him if there is anything going on or if he needs any sort of accommodation from the company.  He said no, that he was sorry and that he would try to be on time.   This was a couple weeks ago and he has not improved.  I have asked the other dev if he knows anything and he says he does not.</p>\n\n<p>At this point I do not feel that pushing the meeting back further will help.  All of us were able to make the 8:00 - 8:30 start time when the boss was breathing down our necks about it.  He knows it, we know it.  I am concerned that if I do not come up with a solution the boss will re-impose stricter rules and my team will lose some of the flexibility that we now enjoy.  What sort or carrots or sticks might I offer to prevent this from happening?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

Nobody can leave until it has been held. Schedule it for [length-of-meeting] minutes before whenever a 40-hour-a-week person would leave if they came in at 8. (If such a person would leave at 4, hold it at 3:45.]</p>\n\n<p>Now you can all talk about what you did today, and what you will continue to do if you're not leaving yet, and what you'll be doing first thing tomorrow before LateGuy is in. You can cover all the same bases as a morning meeting but without having to wait for LateGuy. What's more, the early people can take action at 8am if they learn from LateGuy that such action needs to be taken. </p>\n\n<p>If you do this, he is now free to have his flex time (within reason - he can't work 8pm to 4am or you wouldn't be able to have a meeting.) Perhaps with the tension removed, his productivity and quality will go back to where they were. Perhaps he'll start coming in at 11, or noon, or 3, and you'll have to drill more deeply into what is happening and how the company feels about it. But more likely he will arrive roughly between 9:30 and 10:30 most days, and get to work, and you'll be fine.</p>\n\n<p>If it turns out that end-of-day meetings just don't work and you and the other on-time arriver are suffering with an end of day meeting, then you have to tell him that he must regularize his hours enough that there is a time in the morning (and not 11:59 either) when you can be sure he will be in so that a morning meeting can be held. Get his agreement on a time and then if you must, get the boss to make it clear that being in by that time is a condition of employment. But don't go there until you've given end of day meetings a fair try. That should increase the chances he'll agree to a reasonable schedule for beginning of day ones if they're vital.</p>\n\n<p>(By the way, my guess is that he's recently started an evening activity -- online gaming, or a new significant other, or square dancing -- and is staying up later and later every night in some semi-addictive spiral, then having a harder and harder time getting up in the morning. His tiredness is causing the quality lapse, and he resists your actions because he tells himself that he will stop earlier tonight and not have a problem any more. If this is what's happening he may spiral himself right out of a job, or the initial excitement may wear off and he may go back to a more normal rhythm. But you can't manage assuming this is the case, hence my suggestion for a reasonable rearrangement, at least as an experiment.)</p>\n"

It's extremely hard to do estimations because almost daily I discover something bad which delays me.</p>\n\n<p>Two months ago I asked my manager if somebody else could help me on this project, and my manager assigned another engineer to this project. Then he asked me for estimations and it was estimated that this project would be completed in mid January (with 2.5 people assigned).</p>\n\n<p>In practice this very talented engineer in the last month has managed to work on this project only one week, due to being busy with some other tasks (manager knows about it).</p>\n\n<p><strong>My situation with the temporary internal role:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I just managed to get an informal offer for temporary position in a different department of my company -- the position will last until mid May next year.</p>\n\n<p>Now, when I went to my manager to tell him that I would like to start with the temporary position in the other department he told me that he wants me to finish my project first.</p>\n\n<p>The project isn't going smoothly both for its nature and lack of resources, so I doubt I'm going to complete it by mid January -- as things are now, February or March are a better guess.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>\n\n<p>My manager would like to keep me on this project until it's done. While the temporary position is only until mid May.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if the start date is too late, they might not be interested in me anymore.</p>\n\n<p>If anything goes wrong I'm very tempted to resign, but again the problem is that I would be still stuck in this role for the three months of notice. The relationship is definitely compromised.</p>\n\n<p>I am looking for suggestions on how to proceed in this situation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To Consider:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>My manager does not gain anything from me moving to the temp role;</li>\n<li>I'd like to stay with this company because every few months there are good positions available in other departments. Not too secondary for me, good company perks.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\nAssistant:"

Could you go into another position?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That is, get yourself clear on your constraints.</p>\n\n<p>Then, analyse your manager and your company:\n - Does your manager gain anything by letting you do this temp job?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Does he have to fear you changing intra company for good?</p></li>\n<li><p>Does your company profit from you doing the temp job? In which ways? More than in your current project?</p></li>\n<li><p>Are you in a position to threaten to leave if you aren't allowed to change position? This has to be done in a culture appropriate way, but if the company at large values you, this might work.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From what you are writing, I gather you don't want to stay with your current manager at all. So he has nothing to gain, but much to loose. The only thing he could gain is appreciation from fellow managers if he let's you go, but that's down to office politics.\nSo you have to gain the support of another sponsor, head of another department or some such, who has the will and power to convince people that it's for the good of the company to let you change. This will likely sour the relationship with your current manager, it's on you if you are willing to do this.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen changes like this happen, and rarely was the original manager happy with this. Usually they fight with everything they got to keep good people. Good managers also have an eye for the happiness of their people, bad don't...\nAlso, such fights often took months or even a year.</p>\n\n<p>So it is possible, and you have to weigh your options:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Quit.</p></li>\n<li><p>Stay.</p></li>\n<li><p>Force a change of positions.</p></li>\n</ul>\n"

After 1 year they gave me really good increment and recognized me as one of their really good employees. But I am facing an issue there and I'm not sure what to do about it.</p>\n\n<p>Issue:</p>\n\n<p>My team leader does not provide me any negative feedback or constructive criticism. If something is his opinion is not right then he does not point out that thing to me but directly informs about that to his senior, who is project manager.</p>\n\n<p>I am worried that because of this the project manager would be thinking that team lead talks to me but I do not listen to him. Once I was called by project manager and CEO to talk about my interest in the work, and I had no idea what caused those meetings. Apparently team lead had told them that I'm not interested...And project manager also asked me how are my terms with the team lead i.e. is he helpful to me...</p>\n\n<p>It was few months after this that I got a good increment. And obviously that was good feedback of team lead that contributed in that increment.</p>\n\n<p>After those meetings with manager and CEO, I really wanted to ask team lead about this that what am I doing wrong. But I did not, and recently something has happened again that instead of first talking to me, he approached project manager.</p>\n\n<p>I really want to ask team lead about this. And since he prefers to involve manager too, so I wanna talk about it to him too. But I am a straight forward person, I do not know any politics. And I do not have much professional experience. So, I'm afraid that if I'll ask them then things can get complicated for me.</p>\n\n<p>I'll also mention that I'm not a very talkative person. And usually some people think that it is difficult to talk to me because I'm very reserved. But it should not stop a team lead from talking to his subordinate...</p>\n\n<p>How can I encourage my Team Lead to give me the negative feedback directly before escalating management? Should I simply ask team lead to provide me negative feedback? Will it be wise to write it in an email and 'CC' to project manager too?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

And yes, your talk to your team lead <em>should not include anything about the team lead telling your higher management about you not being interested</em>. Your question should be about your personal development where you ask him/her what you can do to improve your skills. </p>\n\n<p>The best way to prevent these kind of issues in future <em>is to make sure that your lead is comfortable talking to you about your faults</em> (or what he/she presumes are your faults). The expectation that your lead will tell you about your performance might not work out always. Hence, get him/her comfortable by initiating the communication from your side in a positive way. Take it as an opportunity to improve your skills by getting feedback from your lead. This is an interpersonal skill that will serve you well in the future.</p>\n\n<p>PS: As an afterthought, just asking someone to provide negative feedback might not work. I have been asked the same by some teammates and I find it difficult to put up with these requests. Also, shooting out an email with the manager in CC is a nice way to blow up your relations with your lead.</p>\n"

I\u2019m creative and have no problem coming up with ideas, but since she puts herself in so many unnecessary meetings (where she can play visionary), which I feel could easily just be a phone call or an email, the resulting work trickles down to me since she doesn't have time to do it. She's also frequently volunteering me for tasks, which I find disrespectful, and would never do to her. She's not a bully, she's very nice about her irritating behavior.</p>\n\n<p>I could be wrong, but I feel like my coworker is trying to keep control on what she views as her little kingdom. It seems like she\u2019s afraid she\u2019s getting old and out of the loop, nearing retirement, when I have no desire to kick her off her pedestal, I just want things to be fair. But truth be told, we work in a techie field, and I've stayed up to date as things have changed where I feel that she hasn't, so it's like she puts herself in meetings where she's comfortable playing visionary, and I do all the work she no longer knows how to do.</p>\n\n<p>Any advice on what I should do?

It was a substantial increase, retroactive to the beginning of the year.</p>\n\n<p>I filed it away.

I looked at my paychecks online and found that I was actually being paid <em>$5k less</em> than that amount. Unfortunately, I'd misplaced that letter, and started to suspect that I had just misread it. And it was still a decent increase, after all.</p>\n\n<p>My next annual salary adjustment hailed a \"raise\" of $2k (i.e., less than I originally thought I was making the year before). But again, I couldn't say for sure without last year's letter, and I was embarrassed to think I'd misread that sort of pay increase.</p>\n\n<p>After filing this year's salary adjustment letter, however, I found my original letter from 2017. It really does have that higher salary figure in black and white, and confirmed that number by saying it was \"an increase of $XX,XXX.\" I hadn't misread it after all.</p>\n\n<p>I brought all three salary adjustment letters to HR today and asked what happened. It turns out my manager asked for special permission to give me the larger-than-usual raise. In an email to HR, the CEO approved the smaller raise I actually got, but somehow that change never made it to the letter my manager ultimately signed and handed to me a couple weeks later.</p>\n\n<p>On the surface, it looks like an honest mistake on HR's part.
