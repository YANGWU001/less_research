But I did tell him a while ago that I did not want his letter if it would not be strong, and yet he still agreed to write for me.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I am about to finish an undergraduate degree, with a good enough GPA that even if I got C's in all of my current classes, my final overall cumulative GPA would remain above 3.6.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming I graduate with all the whistles in my diploma it would be:</p>\n\n<p>Honours Bachelors of science in computer science with distinction and a minor in pure mathematics (quite pompous).</p>\n\n<p>In order to complete all of those whistles I had to do supervised research for two semesters. Being a naive undergraduate, I knocked on proffessor's doors, asking for a supervisor, and one of them, very generously agreed. He suggested a problem I thought was interesting and so I started the research. I originally started throwing analysis at the problem, and started trying to solve some really complex differential equations (which kept me motivated). However I did not make much progress, so after my supervisor marked that I needed to get something, I fully changed my approach and started using some geometric approximations to solve the issue. This generated some results, but was too simple. I'd like to say that my results were inversely proportional to how much effort I was putting in the research.</p>\n\n<p>Time passed, I had multiple potential solutions and a way to evaluate them. On the last week before the final submission I realised there was a bug in my code base that was destroying the results (they were mathematically impossible). I tried to find the error, but the best I could do was identify an area where a mistake could have happened. </p>\n\n<p>Finally I got my evaluation on the course after presenting it. The feedback said the methods were a bit naive and could be improved on, and it was dissapointing that I didn't get numerical results (I had visual results, not numerical), however since I was not a seasoned researcher they decided to be lenient and gave me an A anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I applied to the grad program at my university, and asked the same proffessor to be my supervisor for the grad program. I am in desperate need of financial support until the grad program starts, and so my supervisor said I could do summer research for him and in the meanwhile we could discuss what the grad project could be. What he wants me to do is finish my previous work and get a publication. </p>\n\n<p>The issue is that I legitimately feel that dinking bleach would be more motivating (I am using this metaphor to convey just how much anxiety this is giving me). This research really does not appeal to me in any way or form, and the interesting part is over, all that is missing is finding the bug, which could take more than two weeks to solve and implementing a couple of modifications to make my naive methods less naive if things go well, or complete failure to finish it in the worst case.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to that I have been doing independent research simultaneously as I have been taking courses and doing everything else. Although this independent research still needs a lot of work, it's in a good place, I have already improved many of the papers I have read and have multiple ideas to explore. In an ideal world I would win the lottery tomorrow and I could just support myself while I carry on with this research.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure how to approach my supervisor and tell him I don't want to finish this research, nor how to suggest to do my research instead and get a publication out of that, or even if I should touch on this topic at all.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I did a campus interview two weeks ago (US universities, R1, Engineering). I was not the last candidate, so, by considering the last one, the search was closed one week ago. In the last meeting with the department chair, he said the department will select the final candidate next week and it seems they have made some decisions based on the information I have. I received an update this weekend from the department chair indicating that they are working with the dean's office and I should get an update this week. First, I interpreted this email positively in a way that probably I will be their first choice since they should keep all finalists on hold until the first candidate (assuming to be me!) signs the offer, which normally takes time (negotiation, salary, lab space, ...). So, there is no reason to notify me if I am not the first candidate.</p>\n<p>Then, I looked at this matter differently and thought maybe they already have offered another candidate and they are indeed waiting to get some approval from the dean for that person (probably the candidate has some requests). Because sometimes dean's office can approve the final candidate after a few days since it should not be a long process. I am not sure which case is more likely.

I invited some of my non-academic network who are wonderful collaborators. </p>\n\n<p>After the symposium we discussed further work together. He asked if I would assist with chairing a (broad discipline) conference, and I was excited about us working together, thinking how great it was to have a good relationship with someone who was more focused on our subdiscipline than my supervisors are, and looking forward to post-PhD collaborations. I felt he was 'taking me under his wing' and that my expertise would be highly useful to him.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, the role we had discussed for conference organisation went to someone else, without him informing me. </p>\n\n<p>And I've found out he has been putting together a project proposal with my wonderful collaborators, without mentioning it to me. Naively, it never even occurred to me that someone would do this. It seems particularly weird because geographically I'm located right next to these collaborators, and there are plenty of similar organisations in his area that he could have reached out to.</p>\n\n<p>Right now I'm feeling pretty raw about this. (But perhaps this is on me? Was I simply too trusting?) But we are organising another symposium together. Undoubtedly we will cross paths again in the future, and will be reviewing each other's work. </p>\n\n<p>Any tips on how to manage this relationship going forward? Or other tales of betrayal to help me put this in perspective?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

You don't own people. You established your relations with your network and these relations are still here. For some reason, your collaborators agree to work on a project with someone else and without you. It's their decision. I would reflect on your role in this group.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I know this is a topic that some people have strong opinions about, but a toxic culture is developing in my department whereby several postdocs have convinced themselves that they are being mistreated because of extremely small -- often imaginary -- confrontations.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a postdoc encountered a senior staff member in a doorway. The staff member apparently gave her a \"funny look\", which confirmed the postdoc's view that this staff member is abusing their position of privilege. Anyone who points out that this is a total non sequitur is accused of allowing bullying to flourish. </p>\n\n<p>This situation has been building steadily over the last few years and now five or six postdocs keep a running tally of \"microaggressions\" so microscopic that it is very difficult to see how they can exist. For example, one postdoc sits with their back to a door, and a professor came in to talk to another colleague, and didn't acknowledge them. This incident was talked about for weeks as evidence of the professor's \"rudeness\". In other cases, some people are labelled \"creeps\".</p>\n\n<p>To be clear: I absolutely do not condone abuse. I know power dynamics are real, and that many minorities (of which I belong to several) experience daily microaggressions and othering. I have been on the receiving end of workplace bullying myself, and would never wish to silence real problems. I too am a postdoc, so have no additional power and gain nothing from allowing abuse to flourish.</p>\n\n<p>What worries me is that none of these incidents are being raised with any of the staff members in question. Therefore, many junior researchers have accepted as fact that their professors are horrible and selfish people. I'm concerned about this mindset, because in at least three cases, these \"selfish\" professors have some form of autism (I know this as I'm a wellness officer). Perfectly ordinary behaviour is framed as malicious.</p>\n\n<p>Personally I've found it very upsetting. Many of the people on the receiving end of this gossip are very kind, if not socially awkward, people. It scares me that so many people uncritically accept that everyone with a permanent job is some kind of bogeyman; of course, I cannot betray confidentiality by informing my colleagues that many of these incidents didn't occur and indeed it's kind of ableist to assume you can read minds all the time. Abuse and power struggles certainly can, and often do, occur... but if any of these complaints were substantial they should be raised with HR. </p>\n\n<p>The sad truth is that I think my colleagues just get their power from trash talking others, and aren't actually interested in the truth. Dissenting voices get shunned (and accused of being privileged / not being woke). Anyone who isn't in 100% agreement gets immediately shut down. But, also, my colleagues are just upsetting themselves for no reason. They're scared of encountering these \"terrifying\" professors, most of who have done nothing worse than dressing slightly shabbily and being uncomfortable with eye contact. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone have any advice on dealing with this kind of situation?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

            " <p>Ah. Yes. I am acquainted with things similar to this...</p>\n\n<p>Yes, being \"on the spectrum\", is a sort of disability, manifestly. That is, one has trouble understanding the subtexts. And, specifically, one would not understand how other lower-status/lower-privilege people would receive one's comments/assertions/proclamations.</p>\n\n<p>I myself have come to think that people \"on the spectrum\" can/should be considered \"disabled\" (in a particular technical sense) since they do have problems dealing with the general population.</p>\n\n<p>The obviously actionable problem is the incomprehension ... </p>\n\n<p>Aaaaaaaaah. I do not have a good answer.</p>\n\n<p>-p</p>\n",
            " <p>I don't know whether it would work in your situation, but I have often found that disagreeing in a questioning manner helps defuse more than disagreeing directly when dealing with this sort of 'build up' because explicitly disagreeing makes a person defensive and more rigid in their position. For example, instead of saying \"Prof X wasn't being rude\", you could try something like \"yes, Prof X did seem unusually focussed this morning, must have had something on his/her mind\".</p>\n\n<p>But it sounds like nobody knows each other very well. Such problems tend to disappear when there is more interaction because people are more likely to attribute a bad interaction to 'must be having a bad day' rather than 'must be a bad person' when they know the person. Would it be possible to encourage more interaction within your department? For example, you could suggest a work-in-progress monthly session where PhD students and postdocs once a year or so talk about their work. If you have 4 people from different groups presenting, then more senior people will turn up as one of 'their' students/researchers will be presenting.</p>\n",
            " <p>For dealing with this kind of issue, I recommend looking at the rules for bullying and harassment <em>from both ends</em>.  It is settled law that rules on workplace bullying protect both junior employees from senior employees, but also protect senior employees from junior employees.  Moreover, to sustain a complaint of workplace bullying and harassment, this requires some ongoing or serious acts; it is not established by trivial isolated incidents of the kind you are describing (i.e., so-called \"microaggressions\").</p>\n\n<p>If your description is correct then a formal complaint of harassment for these \"micro-agressions\" would almost certainly not meet the requirements to be sustained.  In view of that, the people making the complaints must be careful that their own characterisations of senior staff, and their own rumour-mongering, does not <em>itself</em> amount to bullying and harassment.  In particular, referring to other staff members as \"creeps\", if done repeatedly and without any legitimate basis, could certainly amount to bullying.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of advice, that is where it gets tricky.  If someone is subject to name-calling and rumour-spreading they have the option to document this and put in their own complaint of bullying, even if they are a senior person and the bullying is coming from a junior colleague.  Ultimately you will need to think about what level of confrontation with this issue is desirable, and whether the staff in your department would be more amenable to an informal discussion to reduce tensions, or a formal complaint process where bad behaviour is dealt with through formal channels.</p>\n"

For example, you could suggest a work-in-progress monthly session where PhD students and postdocs once a year or so talk about their work.

They might leave for other reasons than getting fired.

Sure, if the quality/stature of the venue where this is published is not too high, few would take this paper seriously, but even then, it would be better than no publications at all (seeing that you are just completing a Bachelor's degree - my advice would have been completely different had you been a grad student, where the expectations are a lot higher).</p>\n",

            " <p>Minimum conditions for ensuring this - or any other - paper doesn't hurt your career:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The research findings must be sound.</strong> don't get tempted into writing, or being listed as a co-author for, papers presenting research when you're \"not convinced about the quality\" of the research findings; or 'fluffy' papers which don't really present much at all; or mere rehashes of other results etc.</li>\n<li><strong>The paper must be relatively well-written</strong> - both in terms of language and in terms of structure and narrative flow. Now, I say 'relatively' because this is often hard to get right with the pressure of time and page limits; and with English not being the native language of most researches. So, readers will be somewhat tolerant about this point - but if you write something that is just very hard to follow, or in very poor English, that doesn't reflect well on you.</li>\n<li><p><strong>Unfortunately, attention must be paid to the venue of publication.</strong> I must first qualify that... obviously some publications are more highly-regarded w.r.t. their filtering process and the typical quality of articles they carry, and some less so. The thing is, I believe one should not assume that if a paper is published in a 'weaker' journal, that necessarily means it's bad - and if someone is evaluating your qualifications as an academic they should bother to skim the paper itself and make up their own mind. That doesn't always/often happen, so people may well judge your work by looking at where you've published. Of course, this is not something binary (\"good\" journals and \"bad\" journals, or conferences) -  but having mostly obscure venues in your list of publications does reflect poorly on you, and in some fields I guess there are venues you should actively avoid even at the price of no publication.</p>\n\n<p>Having said all that - for your first publication, as long as it's not a disreputable venue, it doesn't matter much. Most people \"start out small\".</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The last point, about venues, is also a sort of a safety guarantee for you: If you submit a paper to a conference or journal with a good peer-review process, and you're accepted, then it's highly likely that your paper is actually pretty good, and even more likely that it will reflect favorably on you (the converse is not necessarily true of course; lots of good papers get rejected).</p>\n"

The \"Temp\" part is dynamic (is created at the operation and deleted after) and appears to be hard coded in iTunes 10, so I moved the \"iTunes\" folder from above to the other drive, then made the junction point to \"D:\\Temp\\Apple\\iTunes\" (you do where you want; I made \"Apple\" read only to avoid autodeleting and invalidating the junction. Overkill, but I was trying to work quickly- probably not a good idea to link to a sub off %TEMP%).</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, worked like a charm.

This time I just checked the rotating cube, let the extra needed changes happen, and the frames around all my windows disappeared!  Playing with the settings didn't bring them back so I did some googling but the only solution I found was to type \"metacity --replace\" into a terminal, but this only works as long as I keep the terminal open.</p>\n\n<p>So I logged out and logged back in with Ubuntu Classic No Effects and came here.  Basically, I want to turn compiz back on in regular Ubuntu and/or get my frames back in Classic Ubuntu, or just reset everything.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

I then did a benchmark using <strong>Disks</strong> to confirm their speed, using <em>my</em> standard test of <em>1000</em> samples (rather than the standard 100), again on USB 3.0 reader/3.0 port.  1 passed, the other got to ~600 samples and the write speed dropped from ~90 MB/s to under 20 MB/s.  That write speed didn't change back, so I think I &quot;burned&quot;<strong>^</strong> the chip because of the power available on a USB 3.0 port.</p>\n<p>Given that the <strong>badblocks</strong> is an intensive, full disk, write/read process that takes a long time I would suggest using a USB 2.0 card reader, or preferably a USB 3.0 card reader on a USB 2.0 port, to minimize the possibility of burning out a large (expensive) chip.  It will take longer, but so what.  I would then recommend using the <em>standard</em> <strong>Disks</strong> 100 samples to benchmark (USB 3.0 reader/USB 3.0 port).</p>\n<p>I (unfortunately) used a number of smaller 128GB microSD chips to determine the above procedure.  Most of which went back under RMA for having failed my testing.  These chips just aren't as robust as even USB 3.0 thumb-drives, so caveat emptor.</p>\n<p><strong>^</strong>  By the way, if you are on a USB 3.0 card reader/USB 3.0 port and your chip is taking a lot longer than another chip of the same size, it may already be &quot;burnt&quot;.</p>\n<p>^^Taken from the comment I got the usage of badblocks from:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>sudo badblocks -s -w /dev/sd#' on the destination SD card to run a\nwrite-mode pattern test.

            " <p>Not long ago, I myself bought a Canon scanner Lide 300. The driver installation for Lide 400 include the same steps.\nIn my first attempt to install the Linux drivers for my Canon scanner, I failed miserably multiple times. But the scanner worked flawlessly with Windows driver. Over the short period of time, trying and failing, I finally found a way to make the scanner work with Linux.\nThis is my quick guide, how to make the scanner work with Linux system(I tested it on Ubuntu 18.04)! Please, just follow the steps. Should one of the steps not work, try to do the troubleshooting suggestions.\nDO NOT continue with the next step, until the previous one is working.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1 - Scanner recognition</strong></p>\n<p>First, all necessary packages have to be installed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>sudo apt update</code></p>\n<p><code>sudo apt install sane-utils libusb-dev usbutils</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In order to recognize the connected devices via USB, you can use the command <code>lsusb</code>. The scanner from Canon can be filtered out by running:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>lsusb | grep '04a9'</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The identifier <em>04a9</em> is specific for Canon devices. If no output line is shown after execution of previous command, the device is not recognized.</p>\n<p>Troubleshooting suggestions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Check the connection between scanner and computer.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Restart the system, but be sure, that the scanner is properly connected to the computer.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The scanner make some noise adjusting the header during the system start. If that is not the case, try to plug in the scanner in a different USB slot.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you have a Windows system, try to test the USB connection by installing the scanner driver. Canon don't support Linux, but has a good implemented Windows driver.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Step 2 - Scanner identification</strong></p>\n<p>Now, you can run the command <code>lsusb</code> in your terminal and should see the\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2h066.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">output of the lsusb</a>. The yellow framed output line shows the scanner connection. By inserting the bus and device number specific to your system, you can make the request about the permission settings for the particular connection. For example, in my case the bus ID is 001 and device ID is 002. The resulting command line is based on informations about my system is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>getfacl /dev/bus/usb/001/002</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Remember to use your own connection specifications for the request!!!\nThe output of the command will show you the group, you have to join as a user. In my case, it is the group <em>lp</em>, so I join the <em>saned</em> group(scanner management group) and <em>lp</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>sudo usermod -aG saned,lp $USER</code></p>\n<p><code>sane-find-scanner</code> will recognize the scanner and show the <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/i8J3j.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">correct output</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Troubleshooting suggestions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can see the groups, you as a user are participating in, if you type in <code>cat /etc/group | grep $USER</code>. The groups <em>saned</em> and <em>lp</em> should be in the list. If not, try to execute the usermod command again.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Step 3 - Software equipment</strong></p>\n<p>Although the scanner was found, in my case, the identification of scanner by running <code>scanimage -L</code> failed. This has to do with the sane software.</p>\n<p>The suggestion from markling to use the repository(<a href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/1107632/install-canon-lide-300-400-on-ubuntu-18-04\">Install Canon LiDE 300 / 400 on Ubuntu 18.04</a>) worked for me. However, the compilation and installation of the latest sane is in my opinion the cleaner solution.</p>\n<p>As preparation, you have to install the prerequisites:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>sudo apt install build-essential libieee1284-3 gphoto2 autoconf automake libtool gettext git autopoint autoconf-archive pkg-config libjpeg-dev</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, you can enter the folder of your choice and run:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>git clone https://gitlab.com/sane-project/backends.git</code></p>\n<p><code>cd backends</code></p>\n<p><code>./autogen.sh</code></p>\n<p><code>BACKENDS=&quot;canon pixma&quot; ./configure</code></p>\n<p><code>make</code></p>\n<p><code>make install</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After the installation, you should be able to identify your scanner. The output of <code>scanimage -L</code> should look like <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YvWoj.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">that</a>. If you ran <code>scanimage -V</code>, you will get the information about the sane backend version. In my case, by compiling the newest version, the backend status changed from 1.0.27 to 1.0.29.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4 - Additional Software(optional)</strong></p>\n<p>By the way, the scan utility I like the most is SimpleScan:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>sudo apt simple-scan</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n",
            " <p>I have the same scanner and got it working without the drivers from the Canon website or compiling any software myself.</p>\n\n<p>Ubuntu and other Linux distributions use SANE as a back-end to communicate with scanners. Ubuntu 18.04 has an older version of SANE that does not support the CanoScan LiDE 400 yet, but you can use a repository created by Rolf Bensch to easily install the latest release which does support that scanner:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:rolfbensch/sane-release\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It should update the existing SANE version.

        "sft_target": " <p>Not long ago, I myself bought a Canon scanner Lide 300. The driver installation for Lide 400 include the same steps.\nIn my first attempt to install the Linux drivers for my Canon scanner, I failed miserably multiple times. But the scanner worked flawlessly with Windows driver. Over the short period of time, trying and failing, I finally found a way to make the scanner work with Linux.\nThis is my quick guide, how to make the scanner work with Linux system(I tested it on Ubuntu 18.04)! Please, just follow the steps. Should one of the steps not work, try to do the troubleshooting suggestions.\nDO NOT continue with the next step, until the previous one is working.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1 - Scanner recognition</strong></p>\n<p>First, all necessary packages have to be installed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>sudo apt update</code></p>\n<p><code>sudo apt install sane-utils libusb-dev usbutils</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In order to recognize the connected devices via USB, you can use the command <code>lsusb</code>. The scanner from Canon can be filtered out by running:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>lsusb | grep '04a9'</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The identifier <em>04a9</em> is specific for Canon devices. If no output line is shown after execution of previous command, the device is not recognized.</p>\n<p>Troubleshooting suggestions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Check the connection between scanner and computer.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Restart the system, but be sure, that the scanner is properly connected to the computer.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The scanner make some noise adjusting the header during the system start. If that is not the case, try to plug in the scanner in a different USB slot.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you have a Windows system, try to test the USB connection by installing the scanner driver. Canon don't support Linux, but has a good implemented Windows driver.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Step 2 - Scanner identification</strong></p>\n<p>Now, you can run the command <code>lsusb</code> in your terminal and should see the\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2h066.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">output of the lsusb</a>. The yellow framed output line shows the scanner connection. By inserting the bus and device number specific to your system, you can make the request about the permission settings for the particular connection. For example, in my case the bus ID is 001 and device ID is 002. The resulting command line is based on informations about my system is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>getfacl /dev/bus/usb/001/002</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Remember to use your own connection specifications for the request!!!\nThe output of the command will show you the group, you have to join as a user. In my case, it is the group <em>lp</em>, so I join the <em>saned</em> group(scanner management group) and <em>lp</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>sudo usermod -aG saned,lp $USER</code></p>\n<p><code>sane-find-scanner</code> will recognize the scanner and show the <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/i8J3j.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">correct output</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Troubleshooting suggestions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can see the groups, you as a user are participating in, if you type in <code>cat /etc/group | grep $USER</code>. The groups <em>saned</em> and <em>lp</em> should be in the list. If not, try to execute the usermod command again.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Step 3 - Software equipment</strong></p>\n<p>Although the scanner was found, in my case, the identification of scanner by running <code>scanimage -L</code> failed. This has to do with the sane software.</p>\n<p>The suggestion from markling to use the repository(<a href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/1107632/install-canon-lide-300-400-on-ubuntu-18-04\">Install Canon LiDE 300 / 400 on Ubuntu 18.04</a>) worked for me. However, the compilation and installation of the latest sane is in my opinion the cleaner solution.</p>\n<p>As preparation, you have to install the prerequisites:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>sudo apt install build-essential libieee1284-3 gphoto2 autoconf automake libtool gettext git autopoint autoconf-archive pkg-config libjpeg-dev</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, you can enter the folder of your choice and run:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>git clone https://gitlab.com/sane-project/backends.git</code></p>\n<p><code>cd backends</code></p>\n<p><code>./autogen.sh</code></p>\n<p><code>BACKENDS=&quot;canon pixma&quot; ./configure</code></p>\n<p><code>make</code></p>\n<p><code>make install</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After the installation, you should be able to identify your scanner. The output of <code>scanimage -L</code> should look like <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YvWoj.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">that</a>. If you ran <code>scanimage -V</code>, you will get the information about the sane backend version. In my case, by compiling the newest version, the backend status changed from 1.0.27 to 1.0.29.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4 - Additional Software(optional)</strong></p>\n<p>By the way, the scan utility I like the most is SimpleScan:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>sudo apt simple-scan</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p><a href=\"https://www.lexico.com/definition/do_more_harm_than_good\" rel=\"noreferrer\">This Oxford dictionary</a> defines &quot;do more harm than good&quot; as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Inadvertently make a situation worse rather than better.</p>\n<p>\u2018<em>hasty legislation does more harm than good</em>\u2019</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So I think this example means the same thing as</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>hasty legislation does harm rather than good</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does 'more harm than good' in the expression constitute a noun phrase and does 'more' function as a determiner?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>hasty legislation does</em> [<em>more harm than good</em>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or should this expression be parsed differently?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A reminder: Please note that the question is specifically about syntax. Your answer must provide a suggestion as to how to parse the expression.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/do-more-harm-than-good\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Cambridge Dictionary</a> defines the expression as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>to be damaging and not helpful</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/do-more-harm-than-good\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Macmillan Dictionary's definition</a> is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>to make a situation worse instead of better</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/do_more_harm_than_good\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikitionary's definition</a> is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To make a situation worse, usually while trying to make it better.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These are all in line with the definition of the Oxford dictionary in that the expression isn't about a quantitative comparison of harm and good. So those who argue that the expression is about such a comparison should provide some authoritative source.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>In this context, you should take it to mean that <em>legislation</em> will have a number of effects. Some effects are good, some effects are bad. </p>\n\n<p>You can then instead parse the phrase as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>hasty legislation does more harm[ful things] than good [things].</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
            " <p>When you use the syntax \"more X than Y\", X and Y need to be comparable to each other. Therefore, they should both be interpreted as nouns, or both adjectives, or both adverbs. And \"more\" means that they need to be quantifiable in some way. This means you're comparing the quantities, not describing an either/or alternative.</p>\n\n<p>\"harm\" and \"good\" are both being used as quantifiable nouns in this context. It's comparing the amount of harm with the amount of good being done, and stating that the amount of harm is larger.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes the phrase is used when an action has both good and bad effects, but the bad outweighs the good. It can also be used when the action is intended or hoped to have good effects, but they turn out to be negligible compared to the bad effects, which might have been unintended (this would probably only be discovered after the fact). In the latter case, your first interpretation would be pretty close to the actual result, but it's not usually the intent of the speaker.</p>\n",
            " <p>While I agree with the answers from a literal interpretation, I think it's helpful to understand that this phrase is idiomatic in usage and understanding.  I initially said 'nearly idiomatic' because (for native English speakers, at least) the literal meaning is so near to the idiomatic meaning that it's hard to even realize it is idiomatic.   The context is basically always that a solution is intended to improve a situation and the speaker (or writer) is claiming is actually going to make the problem worse.  It really isn't important whether the solution actually does any specific good, it's that the overall result is bad.</p>\n\n<p>The reason you would use this phrase instead of \"harm rather than good\" is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>To acknowledge that the solution is based on good intentions.</p></li>\n<li><p>To acknowledge that there may be some benefits to the solution.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>But mainly it's about 1.  Basically: a way to soften criticism of a solution within a debate or discussion.  If you simply said, \"your solution does harm\", it can come across as an attack on the originators or supporters of that solution.  The use of this phrase implies that intentions behind the solution are good even if the result is bad.</p>\n\n<p>You write in your addendum:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These are all in line with the definition of the Oxford dictionary in that the expression isn't about a quantitative comparison of harm and good. So those who argue that the expression is about such a comparison should provide some authoritative source.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think you are a little confused about this in general.  The reason these sources don't refer to the literal meaning of the words is that this is an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">idiomatic expression</a> as listed in <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/do%20more%20harm%20than%20good\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Merriam-Webster</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An idiom is a phrase or an expression that has a figurative, or sometimes literal, meaning. Categorized as formulaic language, an idiom's figurative meaning is different from the literal meaning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That's why there's an entry for the phrase is the first place.  If you search for other phrases on the the Lexico (Oxford) site you've linked to, you won't find any grammatically correct phrase you type.  It's only those phrases that have some other connotation apart from what the literal words say.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot be fluent in English without becoming familiar with common idioms.  From the wikipedia article above: \"In the English language alone, it is estimated that there are at least twenty-five thousand idiomatic expressions.\"  Most native English speakers use so many idioms in their speech and writing that they are not even aware they are idiomatic.</p>\n\n<p>The phrase makes sense literally but that's not the what the idiom means.  For example, if I say someone is \"high as a kite\" it has a literal meaning: 'positioned at an altitude where a kite would fly' but that's not what it <em>means</em>.  It means the person is intoxicated.</p>\n\n<p>So trying to figure out how to 'parse' this semantically to come to the definitions you are finding doesn't make sense.  Those definitions are for the phrase as an idiom, not what the words mean semantically.</p>\n",
            " <p>The phrase is literal. In an expanded form it means that the speaker believes that contemplated action will have both harmful and beneficial effects but that the harmful effects outweigh or overcome the beneficial ones so that the end result is a net negative.</p>\n\n<p>I know some might suggest that it is idiomatic, but I must respectfully disagree. It means literally what it says, though perhaps it is a bit terse. It is most often and most properly used used when the contemplated action involves both positive and negative results. Some people might occasionally use it even when there are only negative effects when dealing with an action someone else proposed, but in that case they are committing a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie#White_lie\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">white lie</a> for social purposes rather than relying on an established idiom. </p>\n\n<p>This statement makes perfect sense in the context of legislation incidentally. Virtually all legislation has unintended consequences. Virtually all legislation has both good and bad effects. The question is whether the good outweighs the bad and it is common to say that a particular piece of legislation is likely to do more harm than good. While its hard to prove, many people do believe that in general hasty legislation does more harm than good for the country.</p>\n",
            " <p>In this sentence, both \"harm\" and \"good\" are nouns. As Barmar says, they are comparable and are being compared. \"More\" is an adjective modifying \"harm\", saying that the amount of harm is greater than something. \"Than\" is a conjunction (I had to check m-w online for this). It connects the noun phrase \"more harm\" with the noun \"good\", indicating that the comparison is between \"good\" and \"harm\". And \"does\" is of course the main verb. So I think the parsing is </p>\n\n<pre><code>[does [[more harm] than [good]]]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Structurally, this phrase is no different than \"eats more meat than grain\".</p>\n",
            " <p>There is a parallel structure to the phrase \"more harm than good.\"</p>\n\n<p>First, when legislation does something bad, it <em>does harm.</em></p>\n\n<p>Legislation also <em>might</em> do something good, that is, it might <em>do good.</em></p>\n\n<p>But although hasty legislation possibly <em>does some good,</em> in the end it <em>does more harm.</em></p>\n\n<p>Hence hasty legislation does more harm than it does good.</p>\n\n<p>This is a parallel construction with the subject \"legislation\" in both parts (represented by \"it\" in the second part) and the verb \"to do\" as the predicate verb in both parts, so we can drop \"it does\" from the second part:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hasty legislation does more harm than <del>it does</del> good.</p>\n  \n  <p>Hasty legislation does more harm than  good.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And I think the dictionary definition fails to explain all the connotations of the phrase, as dictionary definitions often do. The idea is not that hasty legislation does not do any good; it is literally that whatever good is in it is less than the harm that is in it, so on the whole it makes things worse.</p>\n",
            " <p>Is &quot;more harm than good&quot; a noun phrase?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>hasty legislation does [more harm than good]</p>\n<p>hasty legislation does [things]</p>\n<p>hasty legislation does [stuff]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&quot;things&quot; is a countable noun and &quot;stuff&quot; is an uncountable noun. Both work in place of the phrase without changing the meaning or grammar of &quot;hasty legislation does&quot;, so I would say yes, &quot;more harm than good&quot; is a noun phrase. It doesn't need a determiner any more than &quot;stuff&quot; does.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The meaning you suggest is almost right:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>hasty legislation does harm <strong>overall</strong> rather than good</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The intention is to do good, but the good it does do is overshadowed by the bad, which is most likely unintentional.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Oxford Dictionary's definition, and also Wikipedia's. I think Cambridge Dictionary's and Macmillan Dictionary's definitions are correct but too narrow.</p>\n<p>For example, Macmillan gives the following sentence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Strenuous exercise can often do more harm than good.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Strenuous exercise can reduce fat and cause muscle injury. It can do both good and bad, but if an injury occurs the bad outweighs the good.</p>\n",

It sounds like you don't adjust very well to what your opponent does. As for Raven, I don't know why you don't always have one. They are just complete dominators of the battlefield. They can detect units, hit strong enemies such as Thors with their Raven Missile, and drop turrets in the backfields by your opponents mines. I've actually been beaten by straight Ravens before.

When the 2nd Rax is ready, you should see if the Protoss player built a cybernetic core. If so, build a tech lab for each Barracks and research concussive shell. Build mass marauders.

Necrophos' ult can kill Bristle from 1/4-1/2 health, depending on his facing (and often Bristle faces forward until he gets lower), saving half the effort of killing him. Doom's Infernal Blade can lead a fight well to lower Bristle's HP. AA's Ice Blast prevents his healing, but more importantly reduces the kill threshold to a percentage of his health.</li>\n<li><strong>Holding him in place</strong> or forcing him to change direction allows your team to get in front of him and deal with him.

The problem is with the all the built in RMXP scripts that made to use a 640x480 resolution. <strong>You can actually change the window size with a script that isn't more 10 lines long, but will show only blackness around a 640x480 picture.</strong></p>\n<p>I wrote the resolution script so that a new resolution could be used and have things re-center themselves correctly and draw the tilemap, weather, viewports, etc. to fill the window. I could have easilt included a way for the window size to be changed in game with a script call, but omitted it due to the fact that it would be highly inefficient and prone to errors to re-draw and configure for a different window size once the game is already running. This would be 1000 times worse if the window was resizeable using the mouse.

They don't likely hit head-on so that the second particle or group of particles travels in the exact same direction that the first was travelling in, but rather I imagine it more like billiard balls hitting at different angles with the effect of the particles spreading out in all directions. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but that makes sense to me with what Huygen said.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>eI am a mathematician trying to understand the role of representation theory in physics.</p>\n<p>There have been countless questions on this site like this, but they sadly don't seem to answer me.</p>\n<p><strong>My perspective</strong></p>\n<p>Suppose we have a Hilbert space <span class=\"math-container\">$\\mathcal{H}$</span> with Hamiltonian <span class=\"math-container\">$H$</span>. We LOVE when there is a Lie group <span class=\"math-container\">$G$</span> acting unitarily on <span class=\"math-container\">$\\mathcal{H}$</span> for three reasons (in diminishing order of importance):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Since <span class=\"math-container\">$G$</span> commutes with <span class=\"math-container\">$H$</span>, we get conservation laws (since it means <span class=\"math-container\">$\\mathfrak{g}$</span> (up to some multiplication by <span class=\"math-container\">$i$</span>) is made of Hermitian matrices which commute with <span class=\"math-container\">$H$</span>, and a short computation that their average value (nothing more I think) is conserved.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>We understand better the energy levels; since they're <span class=\"math-container\">$G$</span> representations. We even have an easier time finding them.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>They conserve stationary states.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An example of those is found in the Hydrogen atom, where the <span class=\"math-container\">$SO(3)$</span> action helps us find the energy levels via acting on <span class=\"math-container\">$L^2(\\mathbb{R^3})$</span>.</p>\n<p><strong>Things I do not understand</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Why should I care about projective unitary representations? They only help with 3, which seem the least interesting. I know that physical states are the projective Hilbert space, but I don't see how that helps or is related. A partial answer is that given a projective representation that commutes with the projectivization of the hamiltonian, I can lift it to a unitary representation of a universal cover, and HOPE that it will commute with <span class=\"math-container\">$H$</span> (but I don't see why it should).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I was told about spin, which has that the Hilbert space we're working in is <span class=\"math-container\">$\\mathcal{H} = \\mathbb{C}^2$</span>. I wasn't told what the Hamiltonian is, but that <span class=\"math-container\">$SU(2)$</span> is acting (via Pauli matrices on the lie algebra). I feel like I'm missing a piece of the story (in Hydrogen, we started with the Hamiltonian and noted it had symmetries. Here I wasn't even given a natural <span class=\"math-container\">$SO(3)$</span> projective representation, just a 'hey check out this <span class=\"math-container\">$SU(2)$</span> representation, those operators measure spin good luck).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I don't understand Wigner's classification because it sounds beautiful; I don't understand why types of particles correspond to representations of <span class=\"math-container\">$SO(3,1)$</span> (Is there a natural Hamiltonian invariant to that? So that energy levels are representations?). Maybe I'm trying to learn relativistic QM in a question and if that's the case tell me and I'll try reading elsewhere.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Final remarks</strong></p>\n<p>Maybe I'm approaching QM the wrong way (i.e Proj Hilbert space are states, we have hamiltonian and Schroedinger, and so we're interested in stuff that commute), maybe we should somehow start with a group.

As such, they can be very powerful in corporate, production networks. </p>\n\n<p>I run many honeypots and they provide a useful set of data apart from IDS/IPS. They can tell me the intent of an active attack, the sophistication of an attack, and any contact with a honeypot indicates a serious event.

            " <p>The question reminded me of an article from a not so distant past that surprised me with a similar claim. I was able to find it again, it was \"<a href=\"http://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/5-reasons-every-company-should-have-a-honeypot/d/d-id/1140595\">5 Reasons Every Company Should Have A Honeypot</a>\" on <em>Dark Reading</em> from October 2013. Summarized, their five reasons are: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Attackers test their tools against standard anti-malware software,\nso a honeypot as a system with low false positives will be good to detect\nattacks. </li>\n<li>Honeypots can slow down attackers by setting up decoys and\ndistracting them from the real targets. </li>\n<li>Production honeypots do not require much time investment (compared to \nresearch honeypots) unless an alert is triggered.</li>\n<li>Honeypots help train the security team.</li>\n<li>Honeypots are cheap to set up, because there are lots of free tools.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I do not really agree with all their reasons. In fact the only convincing one for me is #4. Number 2 might be valid, but needs either a sophisticated and probably expensive setup or only unexperienced attackers. Otherwise, they might be able to look behind the curtain very soon and look for the real assets (maybe even exploiting some weakness in the honeypot software itself).</p>\n",
            " <p>Although its primary purpose is in detection and mitigation, I can see how it would also act as a deterrent, <strong><em>if</em></strong> the attacker had reasonable suspicion you use honeypots, but didn't have a way to determine exactly where.  Whether a specific machine is a honeypot should be kept secret, but there's little risk in disclosing the fact that some of your machines among hundreds are honeypots.  For governments, large businesses, and security-sensitive smaller businesses, you would pretty much assume they use honeypots.</p>\n\n<p>Think of it this way.  Everything else being equal, if you had the choice between attacking an installation that probably has honeypots and one that probably doesn't, which would you choose?  Of course, it's not a very large deterrent, but what is?</p>\n"

    "\n\nHuman: <p>The way we create buckets in our org and ensure sane ACLs around it is by providing an automated tool (that internally uses Terraform) to provision an S3 bucket. So say when a user requests for a new bucket, named <code>testBucket</code> we create a bucket named <code>testBucket</code> and also create an IAM user by the name <code>testBucket-user</code>. The automation ensures that the <code>testBucket-user</code>'s policies are such that the only allowed actions to this user are :</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"s3:ListBucket\",\n\"s3:PutObject\",\n\"s3:GetObject\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and the only allowed resource on which the above actions are allowed is the <code>testBucket</code> bucket. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the automation also ensures that the automation puts bucket policies to ensure that the only actions allowed on it are the above 3 actions and only by the user <code>testBucket-user</code></p>\n\n<p>However, on demand (&amp; if business justified) we do make changes to the created bucket policies as and when needed. So recently there was one such requirement, where a certain bucket needed to have a folder in it that was meant to hold all publicly intended images. </p>\n\n<p>Now there were 2 options we had in order to provision the above requirement:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Modify the bucket policy to allow <code>principal:*</code> for the folder in the bucket thus allowing all objects in that folder in the bucket to be by default public. </li>\n<li>To modify and give <strong>PutObjectACL</strong> permissions to the IAM user that has access to that bucket and let the dev manage which objects in the folder can be or can not be public. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As the security team we were more convinced of the first option just because it looked more logical. The problem with the first option however was the fact that now any object (publicly intended or even otherwise) in this folder would be by default public. </p>\n\n<p>I wonder what does the community think here around it?

Users will only be able to do only the operations that are an intersection of the permissions assigned via bucket policy and IAM.

            " <p>I know it isn't the answer to your question -- but I think having a completely separate bucket for the publicly accessible items makes more sense than trying to limit a single folder within the bucket. Buckets are freely created, and hence there's little value in keeping all private and public objects in a single bucket, as they're likely to have different encryption, storage, archival and lifecycle requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Publicly available images are unlikely to be access via the S3 API, and more likely via http, hence it's usually good practice to limit S3 access via Cloudfront, and limit all interaction to the bucket via http -- unless your requirement specifically states the bucket itself has to be public.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you really must, I'm more inclined to place a <code>principal:*</code> for the folder in question -- which is far easier detect and glance through. The bucket policy should only allow <code>s3:GetObject</code> for objects in this 'folder', as anything else would be bad. Also <code>s3:ListBucket</code> is applicable to the entire bucket and not just a folder in the bucket -- so beware.</p>\n\n<p><em>Remember, S3 doesn't have a filesystem per say, it just looks like a folder, but S3 has internally parsed the key of <code>folder/item</code> to look like an item in a folder.</em></p>\n"

But for servers, the focus is on stability - people usually don't want to update critical server software to the newest version as soon as it is released; updates can often break things and they want to wait until it is more thoroughly tested before updating, for stability reasons.

You don't say!</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It might be relevant to mention that a quick look at the Puttygen source code indicates that it seems to generates private keys <em>solely</em> based on mouse movements. It fills an array with the time of mouse movement events in the even cells and the mouse position in the odd cells, sprinkles some magic shuffling over it (shuffling memory, xoring fields), and calls some RSA/DSA/EC* key generator with the array as argument. Whether there is serious evidence that mouse movement is a good entropy source is quite important for such use-cases. Note that this is different from using it as an <em>additional</em> source, such as in the Linux kernel, which will only increase the quality even if it's a mediocre source.</p>\n\n<p>I have a hard time believing nobody ever looked into this.

In many respects, this is just like HTTP vs HTTPS.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>As a side note, the Active Directory protocol from Microsoft, which builds up on LDAP, optionally offers a \"sign &amp; encrypt\" feature, which appears to be some sort of cryptographic protocol embedded within LDAP (i.e. like LDAPS, but in reverse order), which <em>might</em> ensure enough security. I have not seen any decently detailed specification for that protocol, though, so I still recommend LDAPS in that case.</p>\n",

If you use the well known default ports for LDAP or LDAPS it makes it easier for users to find your services.</p>\n\n<p>Also, consider putting in an SRV resource record entry into the DNS for your Internet connected LDAP server, so people will have the right address and port to hit your proxy server.</p>\n"

            " <p>An <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle\" rel=\"noreferrer\">oracle</a> is an individual who knows the personal cell phone number of a god. This enables him (or her) to obtain some information which is usually considered as out of reach of mere mortals, such as glimpses of the future. In cryptography, that's the same, except that no deity is involved: an oracle is any system which can give some extra information on a system, which otherwise would not be available.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider asymmetric encryption with <a href=\"http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2125\" rel=\"noreferrer\">RSA</a>. The standard I link to states how a piece of data should be encrypted with a public key. In particular, the encryption begins with a <em>padding</em> operation, in which the piece of data is first expanded by adding a header, so that the padded data length matches the RSA public key length. The header should begin with the two bytes <code>0x00 0x02</code>, followed by at least eight random non-zero bytes, and then another <code>0x00</code>. Once the data has been padded, it is time to apply the mathematical operation which is at the core of the RSA operation (modular exponentiation). Details of the padding are important for security.</p>\n<p>The encryption result is an integer modulo the <em>RSA modulus</em>, a big integer which is part of the public key. For a 1024-bit RSA key, the modulus <em>n</em> is an integer value greater than <em>2<sup>1023</sup></em>, but smaller than <em>2<sup>1024</sup></em>. A properly encrypted data chunk, with RSA, yields an integer value between <em>1</em> and <em>n-1</em>. However, the padding implies some <em>structure</em>, as shown above. The decrypting party MUST find, upon decryption, a properly formed PKCS#1 header, beginning with the <code>0x00 0x02</code> bytes, followed by at least eight non-zero bytes, and there must be a <code>0x00</code> which marks the end of the header. Therefore, not all integers between <em>1</em> and <em>n-1</em> are valid RSA-encrypted message (less than 1 every 65000 such integers would yield a proper padding upon decryption).</p>\n<p><em>Knowing</em> whether a given integer modulo <em>n</em> would yield, upon decryption, a valid padding structure, is supposed to be infeasible for whoever does not know the private key. The private key owner (the deity) obtains that information, and much more: if the decryption works, the private key owner actually gets the message, which is the point of decryption. Assume that there <em>is</em> an entity, somewhere, who can tell you whether a given integer modulo <em>n</em> is a validly encrypted piece of data with RSA; that entity would not give you the full decryption result, it would just tell you whether decryption would work or not. That's a one-bit information, a reduced glimpse of what the deity would obtain. The entity is your oracle: it returns <em>parts</em> of the information what is normally available only to the private key owner.</p>\n<p>It <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.19.8543\" rel=\"noreferrer\">turns out</a> that, given access to such an oracle, it is possible to rebuild the private key, by sending specially crafted integers modulo <em>n</em> (it takes a million or so of such values, and quite a bit of mathematics, but it can be done). It also turns out that most <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2246\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SSL/TLS</a> implementation of that time (that was in 1999) were involuntarily acting as oracles: if you sent, as a client, an invalidly RSA-encrypted ClientKeyExchange message, the server was responding with a specific error message (&quot;duh, your ClientKeyExchange message stinks&quot;), whereas if decryption worked, the server was keeping on with the protocol, using whatever value it decrypted (usually unknown to the client if the client sent a random value, so the protocol failed later on, but the client could see the difference between a valid and an invalid padding). Therefore, with such an implementation, an attacker could (after a million or so of failed connections) rebuild the server private key, which is usually considered to be a bad thing.</p>\n<p>That's what oracles are: a mathematical description of a data leak, to be used in security proofs. In the case of RSA, this demonstrates that knowing whether a value has a proper padding or not is somehow equivalent to learning the private key (if you know the private key you can attempt the decryption and see the padding for yourself; the Bleichenbacher attack shows that it also works the other way round).</p>\n",
            " <p>An oracle is something which can immediately (<code>O(1)</code>) give you the answer to some problem, usually an infeasible or impossible problem.  For example, a <em>\"Halting-problem Oracle\"</em> could tell you immediately whether a certain program on a certain input halts or not, even though the halting problem is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">uncomputable</a> to us mere mortals.  However, we can sometimes prove some useful properties by pretending certain oracles exist.</p>\n\n<p>In cryptographic papers, for instance, oracles are most often used to show that, even <strong>if</strong> our attackers had access to some seemingly-impossibile oracle, they <em>still</em> wouldn't have any (significant) advantage to breaking our security.  For example, one important property of encryption algorithms <em>(called resistance to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-plaintext_attack\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">known plaintext attacks</a>)</em> is that if an attacker is given a message encrypted with your key <code>m'</code> and they want to know the original message <code>m</code> <em>(or figure out your key)</em>, then giving them another message <code>n</code> and its encryption with your key <code>n'</code> should not help them do so in any way whatsoever.</p>\n\n<p>Taking this to the extreme <em>(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen-plaintext_attack\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chosen plaintext attack</a>)</em>: give an attacker an oracle who can encrypt or decrypt <em>any</em> message with your key <strong>except</strong> for <code>m</code> and <code>m'</code>.  Even under these extreme conditions, we'd want to show for our encryption that the attacker with the oracle will have no advantage in finding <code>m</code> <em>(or your key)</em> than the attacker without the oracle.  This would mean our encryption is safe from chosen-plaintext attacks.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>[Edit]</strong><br>\nHere is another practical example.  In the question <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/8318719/238419\">Could a program ever tell if another program plays chess</a>, we show that no such program exists by first assuming that there <em>is</em> a chess-detection oracle, then showing its existence leads to a logical impossibility.</p>\n",
            " <p>Appearing in many forms, often with an air of confusion, the oracle is essentially an imagined capability which may be attributable to the security side or to the attacker, and is used as a useful tool to appraise security -- if you are careful to distinguish between the Good Oracle and the \"Iffy\" Oracle. </p>\n\n<p>See a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmik9YKXn7A&amp;t=17s\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">5 min video</a> in <a href=\"http://wesecure.net/learn\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Crypto Academy</a></p>\n\n<p>]</p>\n"

Details of the padding are important for security.</p>\n<p>The encryption result is an integer modulo the <em>RSA modulus</em>, a big integer which is part of the public key. For a 1024-bit RSA key, the modulus <em>n</em> is an integer value greater than <em>2<sup>1023</sup></em>, but smaller than <em>2<sup>1024</sup></em>. A properly encrypted data chunk, with RSA, yields an integer value between <em>1</em> and <em>n-1</em>. However, the padding implies some <em>structure</em>, as shown above. The decrypting party MUST find, upon decryption, a properly formed PKCS#1 header, beginning with the <code>0x00 0x02</code> bytes, followed by at least eight non-zero bytes, and there must be a <code>0x00</code> which marks the end of the header. Therefore, not all integers between <em>1</em> and <em>n-1</em> are valid RSA-encrypted message (less than 1 every 65000 such integers would yield a proper padding upon decryption).</p>\n<p><em>Knowing</em> whether a given integer modulo <em>n</em> would yield, upon decryption, a valid padding structure, is supposed to be infeasible for whoever does not know the private key. The private key owner (the deity) obtains that information, and much more: if the decryption works, the private key owner actually gets the message, which is the point of decryption. Assume that there <em>is</em> an entity, somewhere, who can tell you whether a given integer modulo <em>n</em> is a validly encrypted piece of data with RSA; that entity would not give you the full decryption result, it would just tell you whether decryption would work or not. That's a one-bit information, a reduced glimpse of what the deity would obtain. The entity is your oracle: it returns <em>parts</em> of the information what is normally available only to the private key owner.</p>\n<p>It <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.19.8543\" rel=\"noreferrer\">turns out</a> that, given access to such an oracle, it is possible to rebuild the private key, by sending specially crafted integers modulo <em>n</em> (it takes a million or so of such values, and quite a bit of mathematics, but it can be done). It also turns out that most <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2246\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SSL/TLS</a> implementation of that time (that was in 1999) were involuntarily acting as oracles: if you sent, as a client, an invalidly RSA-encrypted ClientKeyExchange message, the server was responding with a specific error message (&quot;duh, your ClientKeyExchange message stinks&quot;), whereas if decryption worked, the server was keeping on with the protocol, using whatever value it decrypted (usually unknown to the client if the client sent a random value, so the protocol failed later on, but the client could see the difference between a valid and an invalid padding). Therefore, with such an implementation, an attacker could (after a million or so of failed connections) rebuild the server private key, which is usually considered to be a bad thing.</p>\n<p>That's what oracles are: a mathematical description of a data leak, to be used in security proofs. In the case of RSA, this demonstrates that knowing whether a value has a proper padding or not is somehow equivalent to learning the private key (if you know the private key you can attempt the decryption and see the padding for yourself; the Bleichenbacher attack shows that it also works the other way round).</p>\n",

I have a ridiculously simple SPDesigner workflow that just has a single action to Update the list item and set the contents of a field to be a link to a form I built to print the list item in a pretty way.  I have the workflow bound to OnCreate and OnChange.  I publish the workflow and everything works properly.</p>\n\n<p>The Problem:\nEvery few months the workflow suddenly stops generating the print link.  When I investigate I can see that the workflow isn't trying to run (i.e. It doesn't say \"Cancelled\" or \"Failed\" or \"Complete\" in the Workflow execution column of the list ... the column is just blank.  Similarly the workflow history list doesn't get any entries when I add items to the list either.)  So I open up Designer and check the workflow and it says it is still bound to Create and Change.  However, the only way to fix the workflow is to publish it again.</p>\n\n<p>The Question: I'm at my wits end to try and troubleshoot this problem.  Has anybody encountered anything similar?

If you are updating then, disabling it could speed up the process. </li>\n<li>Disable the service that you don't want to use.</li>\n<li>A proper configuration of SharePoint involves a farm of several machines. Specially the database should be installed in a different machine.   However, a dev/testing machine usually includes domain + sql server + sharepoint in the same box.</li>\n<li>Disable Health and Usage Service.</li>\n<li>Update SharePoint 2013.  Don't forget to also update the database.</li>\n<li>Lastly : SharePoint 2010 is way more resource friendly. <em>wink</em> <em>wink</em> ;-)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Optionally:</p>\n\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li>Configure Sql Server to use another partition/disk. Also you can configure sql server to limit the memory used (usually its configured to use over 2 trillions of bytes).</li>\n<li>In some cases, Sharepoint 2013 Online is quite inexpensive. Its not blazing fast but its usable.  It costs about $8 per user per month.</li>\n</ol>\n",

If it's your code, you should have a very good idea of what is causing the error before you attempt to fix it. </p>\n\n<p>Futhermore, when you write your code you should already know where and why it's likely to fail.</p>\n\n<p>Having said that - asking a peer, posting on SO, retracing and rolling back your steps and taking a break - all the suggestions mentioned above will help.</p>\n\n<p>The other thing, is you must know your tools - your debugging toolkit. Logging messages at suspect points in your code, examining your call stack carefully, using conditional breakpoints and watches, etc etc. Debugging skills are not extras - they are part of programming.</p>\n",

            " <p>All of these suggestions are great.  However, I use a technique quite often that I didn't see mentioned.  Make lists to organize your thoughts about the problem.  If I have a particularly sticky problem I usually write out multiple lists such as: Facts, Assumptions, Questions, Symptoms, etc.  I find that oftentimes in the process of organizing things in this way I discover assumptions I didn't realize I had (that often turn out to be wrong), questions I didn't realize need to be asked, other permutations I can check, etc.</p>\n",

            " <p>I really didn't like the most up-voted answer, because even though that sometime works, some times you just need to figure it out that same day, so what I'd recommend, in this order, is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Confirm that it's not only happening to you. This can save you a lot of time. Maybe you uninstalled a required component, or made a change in your environment, and an exception is being swallowed somewhere in your code. If it's happening only to you, I would use an environment comparison tool. I recently read about a software called Envy, which allows you to do just that, although it's not freeware, it costs 10 USD.</p></li>\n<li><p>Happening to everybody? Fine, now do a View History on the code and verify for recent changes that might have caused the error, either directly or indirectly.</p></li>\n<li><p>There aren't any recent changes? If it's a very specific error (an exception), 'stackoverflow it'. Now that doesn't sound better than 'google it' but I feel good to say I first search stackoverflow for programming research than google. If it's a really known issue, it's very likely that you'll find a solution here. If not, then post a question on the related stackexchange site. You might get a very quick answer, or even if you don't, your question will be out there while you do more research. That's a benefit.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you didn't find an answer online or it isn't a general error, then walk through the code step by step, checking if the obtained results of each step make sense for the result you expect. Go start to finish on each method, and bottom to top on a tiered solution. (i.e. if you're troubleshooting performance, start with the code that retrieves the records. doesn't make sense to start in the UI if you can determine quickly if the first step is the problem).</p></li>\n<li><p>If after going through the code a couple of times you still haven't found what's wrong, call-in someone to talk about it. As someone already mentioned, talking about it out loud can light the bulb. Plus pair-programming is really useful.</p></li>\n<li><p>At this point, if it's feasible, walk away either for some time or for the day. I read a very true tweet yesterday that said \"I went to bed thinking 'how the fck' and woke up thinking 'but of course'\". So true.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you still don't have an answer, I'd dare say you could try refactoring into smaller tasks/methods/functions. Henry Ford said something like 'There isn't a task so complex that cannot be accomplished by breaking it into smaller tasks'. At this point, if the solution is too complex and you haven't figured out either by yourself or with the help of someone else, refactor the code into smaller tasks. Even if you don't end up commiting it, it can help you find the reason.</p></li>\n<li><p>Add instrumentation to your code.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tweet about it??</p></li>\n</ol>\n",

The computer's strength is its logic so you can't win on logic. You have a brain and have to out-think it. </p>\n\n<p>In modern times there are so many other things interacting on a system - firewalls, AV, Antispyware, automatic updates happening every night - you have to deal with moving targets.</p>\n"

            " <p>The existing answers didn't really address the hardware side of things, so here's a bit on that angle. The conventional wisdom is that multiplication and division are much slower than shifting, but the actual story today is more nuanced.</p>\n\n<p>For example, it is certainly true that multiplication is a more <em>complex</em> operation to implement in hardware, but it doesn't necessarily always end up <em>slower</em>. As it turns out, <code>add</code> is also significantly more complex to implement than <code>xor</code> (or in general any bitwise operation), but <code>add</code> (and <code>sub</code>) usually get enough transistors dedicated to their operation that end up being just as fast as the bitwise operators. So you can't just look at hardware implementation complexity as a guide to speed.</p>\n\n<p>So let's look in detail at shifting versus the \"full\" operators like multiplication and shifting.</p>\n\n<h3>Shifting</h3>\n\n<p>On nearly all hardware, shifting by a constant amount (i.e., an amount the compiler can determine at compile-time) is <em>fast</em>. In particular, it will usually happen with a latency of a single cycle, and with a throughput of 1 per cycle or better. On some hardware (e.g., some Intel and ARM chips), certain shifts by a constant may even be \"free\" since they can be built into another instruction (<code>lea</code> on Intel, the the special shifting abilities of the first source in ARM).</p>\n\n<p>Shifting by a variable amount is more of a grey area. On older hardware, this was sometimes very slow, and the speed changed from generation to generation. For example, on the initial release of Intel's P4, shifting by a variable amount was notoriously slow - requiring time proportional to the shift amount! On that platform, using multiplications to <em>replace</em> shifts could be profitable (i.e., the world has gone upside-down). On prior Intel chips, as well as subsequent generations, shifting by a variable amount wasn't so painful.</p>\n\n<p>On current Intel chips, shifting by a variable amount is not particularly fast, but it isn't terrible either. The x86 architecture is hamstrung when it comes to variable shifts, because they defined the operation in an unusual way: shifts amounts of 0 don't modify the condition flags, but all other shifts do. This inhibits the efficient renaming of the flags register since it can't be determined until the shift executes whether subsequent instructions should read the condition codes written by the shift, or some prior instruction. Furthermore, shifts only write to part of the flags register, which may cause a partial flags stall.</p>\n\n<p>The upshot then is that on recent Intel architectures, shift by a variable amount takes three \"micro-operations\" while most other simple operations (add, bitwise ops, even multiplication) only take 1. Such shifts can execute at most once every 2 cycles.</p>\n\n<h3>Multiplication</h3>\n\n<p>The trend in modern <em>desktop</em> and <em>laptop</em> hardware is to make multiplication a fast operation. On recent Intel and AMD chips, in fact, one multiplication can be issued every cycle (we call this <em>reciprocal throughput</em>). The <em>latency</em>, however, of a multiplication is 3 cycles. So that means you get the <em>result</em> of any given multiplication 3 cycles after you start it, but you are able to start a new multiplication every cycle. Which value (1 cycle or 3 cycles) is more important depends on the structure of your algorithm. If the multiplication is part of a critical dependency chain, the latency is important. If not, the reciprocal throughput or other factors may be more important.</p>\n\n<p>They key takeaway is that on modern <em>laptop</em> chips (or better), multiplication is a fast operation, and likely to be faster than the 3 or 4 instruction sequence that a compiler would issue to \"get the rounding\" right for strength reduced shifts. For variable shifts, on Intel, multiplication would also generally be preferred due to the above-mentioned issues.</p>\n\n<p>On smaller form-factor platforms, multiplication may still be slower, since building a full and fast 32-bit or especially 64-bit multiplier takes a lot of transistors and power. If someone can fill in with details of the performance of multiply on recent mobile chips it would be much appreciated.</p>\n\n<h3>Divide</h3>\n\n<p>Divide is both a more complex operation, hardware-wise, than multiplication and is also much less common in actual code - meaning that fewer resources are likely allocated to it. The trend in modern chips is still towards faster dividers, but even modern top-of-the-line chips take 10-40 cycles to do a divide, and they are only partially pipelined. In general, 64-bit divides are even slower than 32-bit divides. Unlike most other operations, division may take a variable number of cycles depending on the arguments. </p>\n\n<p>Avoid divides and replace with shifts (or let the compiler do it, but you may need to check the assembly) if you can!</p>\n"

But that doesn't make you a \"professional programmer\"; it can make you a \"freelancer\" at most.</p></li>\n<li><p>Don't under-estimate the value of what is taught in school.

They cannot be deployed by a developer alone. Professional programmers have to work with others. It's not just a matter of good knowledge of tools (like languages, IDEs etc.) but also of techniques, methods and idioms.</p></li>\n<li><p>While tools can be taught by formal samples and exercise, techniques and idioms can only be \"described\". To \"learn\" them you have to experience and share the experience with others. They are continuously invented and improved.</p></li>\n<li><p>Companies, when hiring from school, check your understanding of tools and your ability with basic technics, but - most important - test your capability in rapidly learning new things and \"capture the work\" as it is needed.</p></li>\n<li><p>When hiring for experienced people, they look at how many things they have done and what experience they got from those things.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Moral:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If you want to be more \"evaluated\" learn to work with others, by participating in other's problems (like on <a href=\"http://www.stackoverflow.com\">stackoverflow</a>) or open projects (like on <a href=\"http://www.sourceforge.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">sourceforge</a>) </p></li>\n<li><p>Also, don't be too fast to ask for money; split your \"code production\" in \"something to share\" and \"something to sell\".  What you can share can be used by others but can also attract the participation of others to expand the initial project. What you can sell is what makes your app \"unique\" with respect to other similar projects, leading it to become a real commercial product.<br>\nTo share code with others, you can refer to site <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">codeproject</a> or <a href=\"http://www.sourceforge.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">sourceforge</a>.

            " <p>A few things you might want to try:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Write software that solves real problems, ideally problems that haven't been solved before (or at least not satisfyingly so). If nobody uses your software despite your best promotional efforts, chances are they simply don't need it that desperately.</li>\n<li>Announce your work on relevant mailing lists, IRC channels and internet forums. If your program makes extensive use of some library, consider posting to the library's community; if it complements other existing pieces of software, announce to their communities, etc.</li>\n<li>If it's a serious enough project, set up a dedicated web site for it. The web site should provide a feature summary, links to downloads and documentation, and (if applicable) a few screenshots. Make sure it's a proper website, not some ad-ridden cheapo geocities-style abomination - you want to be taken seriously, so act upon it. Adding a news section, a wiki and / or a bug tracker gives potential user an indication how active the project is, which can work for you or against you (if the project is not very active after all).</li>\n<li>If it's an open source project, host it on one of the popular FOSS hubs (github, bitbucket, sourceforge if you have to), and (see above) expose the wiki and the bug tracker (but only if you use them regularly).</li>\n<li>Whatever you do, provide good documentation. You need both a short \"getting started\" and a full reference. If you don't have the first, people will find your program too hard to use. If you don't have the second, people will stop using it because they can't find the information they need.</li>\n</ul>\n",
            " <p>First of all, let's be clear: most of the 16 YO programmers will not really impress the community.</p>\n\n<p>There is a reason for that in my opinion. Being a good programmer does not only rely on programming skills. As you hopefully see during your CS major, programming is only a <strong>subset</strong> of computer science, and most of the people winning prizes (academic prizes at least) will have done so because they proved something new (a new theorem for example), or discovered a new way to achieve some kind of task (design patterns). In order to do so, you need to (at least):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Get a good background in math, it is required to understand algorithmics and hence master the different data structures.</li>\n<li>Understand that a good programmer first understands the paradigms (object-oriented, functional, ...) before being interested by a \"concrete\" language.</li>\n<li>Understand that good programming often also comes for code modelling, and learn the existing design-patterns.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you feel you have already mastered all that, then yes, you will probably impress the community.</p>\n\n<p>You can always try to contribute to an open-source project, but you might be also quite surprised how much you have to catch up before actually being able to contribute.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, have a look around on <a href=\"http://www.stackoverflow.com\">StackOverflow</a> and see how much you can answer there in your favorite language... you'll have a good proxy of your level.</p>\n",
            " <ol>\n<li>Learn as much as you can.  This can be done by books, forums, classes, but most importantly by actually programming (and getting critiqued).  If you've outgrown the programming classes at your high school, see if a local (community) college has any good CS classes that you can take (maybe over a summer or as a night class); or try taking open course ware from MIT/Stanford types.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate initiative.  Saying you know C++ will be totally disregarded.  Saying you have dozens of commits to a list of open source projects demonstrates you know something, etc (though be careful; don't just commit for the sake of committing).  Start your own open source projects.  This isn't going to be something you do in an afternoon; but something that becomes your baby over a period of months.

            " <p>I am a freelance programmer.  Programming has been my primary income since I have graduated high school 9 years ago.  I still intend to get my degree, but at the moment the time still isn't right for me.</p>\n\n<p>My path to self driven recognition was as follows.  I'm not saying that these steps will make you recognized by the programming community, but it will help increase your credibility when it comes time to interview.</p>\n\n<p>Even after I was fairly versed in programming IMO at the time, I went back to the basics and went through tutorials and built myself a portfolio based on inspired works from those.  I also began to force myself to comment my code in a JavaDoc-esque fashion.  The portfolio may not be filled with glitz and glamour right now, but it gives you a baseline that you can build off of and eventually replace what you have in there.  I then had a set of demos and code samples to show to prospective clients.  This is essential in getting your first job.  Nobody wants to hire someone that doesn't have any experience, however, there are a number of individuals who will give a chance to a promising looking programmer that doesn't have professional experience.</p>\n\n<p>I later analyzed these programs and began to write libraries based on my commonly used tasks.  With my new libraries I began looking at CompSci problems on the internet and began timing myself on how long it would take me to build a solution with my libraries.  This would give me a baseline in the future as to what I should charge for a specific task.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn't until then that I had discovered open source.  I looked through the projects on sourceforge in the language I was interested in and found applications I could make use of.  I installed these applications and began using them as a part of my every day computing experience.  I was able to see the strengths and weaknesses of these applications as far as my every day interaction was and I began to extend them to suit my needs.  I would submit my patches to the community developing to be reviewed, and after a few I would apply to become a member of the project.  This is where I learned to use the different tools used when working in a team that took my \"vast experience\", as I considered it at the time, and took it to the next level.</p>\n\n<p>I adapted all of my practices that I had picked up working on open source projects and implemented comprable solutions when I was working as an individual.  I began seriously pursuing a career as a freelance developer and joined a number of freelance recruitment sites.  I looked at what the popular jobs were, and began applying.  For every job that I would get turned down, I would still complete it for myself as if I had obtained the job to expand my knowledge.  This would help build my portfolio and introduce me to some real world challenges.  When I finally did get that first interview I was straightforward, told them that I didn't have any professional experience.  I then began to tell them the open source projects that I had worked on, what I had accomplished there.  Some major hurdles I had come across, and how I addressed them.  I was able to offer a portfolio of working applications and example code based on my experience as an amateur, and they took in all of the information and provided me with the opportunity to step in to the freelance world.</p>\n",

            " <p>One answer I didn't read yet: Google Summer of Code.</p>\n\n<p>From the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/soc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Google Summer of Code is a global program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source software projects. [...] Through Google Summer of Code, accepted student applicants are paired with a mentor or mentors from the participating projects, thus gaining exposure to real-world software development scenarios.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You have to be 18 to participate, but that isn't far off. I know some people who participated and had a great experience. Because all your contributions are to open-source programs, they are public, so they'll be noticed.</p>\n\n<p>Since you are under 18, Google also has a GSOC-like program for pre-university students (13-17 year olds) called <a href=\"http://code.google.com/opensource/gci/2011-12/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Code IN</a>.</p>\n",
            " <p>There are tons of places to put your work up to get recognized, but while you may consider your work top notch, it may just be a simple day at work for some. When I was 16, I thought my work was awesome, I was doing some cool stuff, but I am actually working in these fields now, and where I was then is nothing compared to where I am now, and I still am a long ways off from where I want to be.</p>\n",
            " <p>From my point of view, there are types of people who program.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\"Programmers\" - These include 16 year old self taught and 99% of the available \"software developer\" work force in china. They can get the job done... sort of.. in a minimal sense, but have little ideas of concepts such as design patters, maintainability, robust/defensive coding, algorithms/data-structures and other things that like efficient use of source control software. They have the ability to effectively read documentation and use most APIs.</li>\n<li>\"Average Electrical Engineer\" - 80% Electrical, 10% computer science, 10% software engineer.\nProficiency with electronics, but just about as much programming as the typical \"programmer\". Logic and critical thinking, and management skills from the electrical side will help though.</li>\n<li>\"Average Computer science BS graduate\" - 25% programmer, 25% software engineer, 25% computer scientist, 25% applied electronics (logic included). </li>\n<li>\"Average Computer Engineer\" - These people are a mix of 50% electrical engineer, 50% computer science graduate.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Definitions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\"Computer Science\" - Dijkstra once stated: \"Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.\" Computer Science is more about math than it is about computers. This includes the ability to develop, understand, and classify complex algorithms and data structures. </li>\n<li>\"Software Engineering\" - Design Pattern, diagrams representing programs (I can't remember what these are called). stuff like that. Defensive coding.. Source control use, </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Notice, I used the word \"Average\" above. Depending on personal interests and job experience, these percentages can change drastically.\nThese are just over-generalized stereotypes. Don't judge a book by it's cover.\nI am also just BSing percentages from my experience.</p>\n",
            " <p>I respectfully disagree with those who answered \"don't overestimate yourself\"!</p>\n\n<p>If you have a love for programming at your age, go for it, you are probably great and greater than other kids your age, and by the time you are a veteran, you might be the next Brian Kernighan, Edsger Dijkstra or Doug Lea!</p>\n\n<p>I would suggest learn IPhone or Android development, and build some real apps.</p>\n\n<p>Get great at something and while you are getting there, speak at conferences and write articles, that will get you noticed, and will polish your skills.</p>\n\n<p>I have been programming since the late 70's, and in Java since 1996. I can tell you the most important Java book I ever read was the Gang of Four Design Patterns, which was written a decade before Java was invented. Read it and be great!</p>\n\n<p>The highest paying industry today is financial, but that is changing rapidly. I believe it will come back, but you never know!</p>\n\n<p>Be a programmer and enjoy high employment and job satisfaction!</p>\n\n<p>Good luck, you have a great career ahead of you!</p>\n",
            " <p>I have a slightly different viewpoint here. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to get your software noticed, the best way is to have people using it. Although Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg were great young programmers, there were lots of better programmers. But these two gentlemen got lots of people to use their products and are therefore better known for their work. </p>\n\n<p>To get people to use your code you could:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sell your product to lots of people. For example put up a mobile app at an app store and track downloads, purchases and continuing usage. </li>\n<li>Get lots of people to use your product, and make advertising revenue. </li>\n<li>Get lots of developers to develop products which work with your product. This is hard. </li>\n<li>Contribute to a popular open-source project so that your contributions will be used by lots of people. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In my opinion, software is almost irrelevant without providing benefit to users. And you will get noticed for solving problems which people care about, and that is a very rare skill. </p>\n",
            " <p>If you want to get noticed AND make some money I would recommend mobile development on iPhone or Android.  You already know C++, which is a great start.  For native development on iPhone you'll need Objective C, and for Android you'll need Java.  Both are similar to C++ (Java is easier since there's not memory management), and will not be too difficult to learn.  So not only will you write applications that will get you noticed, and make you some money, but you will learn new languages and hot platforms in the process.</p>\n",
            " <p>I think that JohnFX gave a great answer to this question.  </p>\n\n<p>A few thoughts: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>I think jQueryUI might be the best place to start.  It is fun and visual. So you can go on the jQueryUI developer forum on the jQuery site and ask to be a contributor.</p></li>\n<li><p>I think you will be demonstrating great passion and dedication for programming more than you will be demonstrating great skill. But don't let that stop you!  I strongly encourage you to be involved.</p></li>\n<li><p>At this point you might have to settle for doing QA.  QA is boring but you can accept it and show dedication.  But from there you can contribute a bit of code and maybe make plugins.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you ask to be involved in something and they make it difficult, it is because they are assholes.  Just look for a project where the people are encouraging and nice.</p></li>\n<li><p>After you find a project with encouraging, nice people and you contribute, you can ask one of the adult contributors or hopefully one of the people in charge of the project to write you a short letter of recommendation.</p></li>\n</ul>\n",
            " <p>Build a web app that works well on the iPhone and Android (ignore standard browsers for now) and take advantage of HTML5's extended features (https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/HTML5) to overcome latency, spotty network, and the limitation of phone browsers. This most likely means delivering a javascript+html5  browser app that connects to a server-based api. (pick xmlrpc/json/yaml, not SOAP). make it screaming fast. On the server, I recommend using cherrypy in linux (debian) on cheap VPS. You can get some at 123systems.com, buyvm.net (preferred but often not available) for under $4 a month. Learn to use Python, and use Fabric to deploy your stuff to your server(s). Get a .info domain at namecheap.com for $2.99 a year, and use dnsmadeasy.com for DNS (more expensive, but worth it-- been using them for years, never had a single issue) where you can do load-balance via DNS. Also, don't be put off by databases. Use sqlite and learn to design your tables manually with sql statements. Finally, with one machine you can probably handle 30,000 users. (2,000 simultaneously at one hit to server every 3 seconds). Remember to cache as much as possible in HTML5's storage. </p>\n\n<p>If you do this, and you blog about it and twit about the blog entries and your progress, you will definitely get noticed. Granted there's a lot to learn, but you can do it!</p>\n",

But that doesn't make you a \"professional programmer\"; it can make you a \"freelancer\" at most.</p></li>\n<li><p>Don't under-estimate the value of what is taught in school. Even if something may seem obvious to you, study it as well: you'll see \"new aspects\" (I'll be more clear later) as you will proceed.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Professional applications have typical life-cycle of 3-5 years and require thousands (up to millions) man-hour working. They cannot be deployed by a developer alone. Professional programmers have to work with others. It's not just a matter of good knowledge of tools (like languages, IDEs etc.) but also of techniques, methods and idioms.</p></li>\n<li><p>While tools can be taught by formal samples and exercise, techniques and idioms can only be \"described\". To \"learn\" them you have to experience and share the experience with others. They are continuously invented and improved.</p></li>\n<li><p>Companies, when hiring from school, check your understanding of tools and your ability with basic technics, but - most important - test your capability in rapidly learning new things and \"capture the work\" as it is needed.</p></li>\n<li><p>When hiring for experienced people, they look at how many things they have done and what experience they got from those things.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Moral:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If you want to be more \"evaluated\" learn to work with others, by participating in other's problems (like on <a href=\"http://www.stackoverflow.com\">stackoverflow</a>) or open projects (like on <a href=\"http://www.sourceforge.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">sourceforge</a>) </p></li>\n<li><p>Also, don't be too fast to ask for money; split your \"code production\" in \"something to share\" and \"something to sell\".  What you can share can be used by others but can also attract the participation of others to expand the initial project.

Obviously, before putting finger to keyboard to design your language you will have thought carefully about what it is intended to do. </p>\n\n<p>If it's a new, interpreted language to replace JavaScript then you'll be wanting a very laissez faire approach in order to reach web developers with a limited attention span and a desire for immediate results - or quicker if possible.</p>\n\n<p>If it's going to be used on the next mission to Titan, then extremely detailed specifications showing exact formal proofs of the behaviour of each component will be the minimal entry level.</p>\n\n<p>So, it's not a straightforward thing. To approach the specification, you would probably be better off gaining a lot of experience in creating your languages and also working with those who actually use them on a day to day basis. If you have willing victims... er... developers, at work who can take some time to learn your language then they can give you feedback on what is needed to get them to use it.</p>\n\n<p>In short, keep it simple and more people will use it. </p>\n",

Yes, I do judge SQL servers by their user interface.  <strong>Everything has a user interface.</strong>  Well, almost everything anyway.  Shells, config files, commands, log files, they all are an interface for users.  Even most linux kernel modules have some UI exposed as files in /sys and /proc.  Yes, those are user interfaces.  Just because it isn't <em>graphical</em> doesn't make it any less important.</p>\n\n<p>Example: I know Postgres is an excellent database.  I'm sad sometimes I don't use it more. I use MySQL more.  Why?  Part of it is that the shell commands are easier to use.  <code>show databases;</code> says what it does and does what it says. I looked that up once, the first time. Never did again. When I use psql, I can rarely remember. Is it <code>\\dl</code> or just <code>\\l</code>? No wait, isn't <code>\\dl</code> something else? Huh, do I really want <code>\\dn</code>? Shoot, ok, what's the command for help? <code>\\help</code>? No, that's a list of SQL commands.  Where is the list of shell commands? Ah. <code>\\?</code> has the list. WHY is <code>\\?</code> different from <code>\\help</code>?</p>\n\n<p>Yeah if I used it all the time I'd get used to it. That's not the point. The point is that well designed software shouldn't require \"getting used to.\"</p>\n\n<p>I know that seems like a silly example but it does have an effect.</p>\n",

They deliver a decent working product and as and when bugs are fixed, the software get updated automatically. This is very helpful for the enduser as he has the latest build always. This will also help in your case because when you get more budget and time, you can push new features easily. </p>\n\n<p>I think the other best quality of a software product is how it handles exceptions and respond to exceptional scenarios. Most programs fails to handle this gracefully. They either get killed by unhandled excpetions or they produce meaningless error messages which confuses the user. </p>\n\n<p>Creating bug free software is not a simple job. It will happen eventually as and when the program evolves. But it is programmers duty to make sure enough information is available to debug the issue. One good example of how to produce excellent error messages to user is <a href=\"http://www.virtualbox.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">VirtualBox</a>.

It may seem clich\u00e9d, but there's some truth to the statement \"beautiful things work better.\"</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em><strong>Edit 9/18/2013:</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>It's been years now but Morten's question below has been stuck in my head all this time.  Yes, I do judge SQL servers by their user interface.  <strong>Everything has a user interface.</strong>  Well, almost everything anyway.  Shells, config files, commands, log files, they all are an interface for users.  Even most linux kernel modules have some UI exposed as files in /sys and /proc.  Yes, those are user interfaces.  Just because it isn't <em>graphical</em> doesn't make it any less important.</p>\n\n<p>Example: I know Postgres is an excellent database.  I'm sad sometimes I don't use it more. I use MySQL more.  Why?  Part of it is that the shell commands are easier to use.  <code>show databases;</code> says what it does and does what it says. I looked that up once, the first time. Never did again. When I use psql, I can rarely remember. Is it <code>\\dl</code> or just <code>\\l</code>? No wait, isn't <code>\\dl</code> something else? Huh, do I really want <code>\\dn</code>? Shoot, ok, what's the command for help? <code>\\help</code>? No, that's a list of SQL commands.  Where is the list of shell commands? Ah. <code>\\?</code> has the list. WHY is <code>\\?</code> different from <code>\\help</code>?</p>\n\n<p>Yeah if I used it all the time I'd get used to it. That's not the point. The point is that well designed software shouldn't require \"getting used to.\"</p>\n\n<p>I know that seems like a silly example but it does have an effect.</p>\n",

They deliver a decent working product and as and when bugs are fixed, the software get updated automatically. This is very helpful for the enduser as he has the latest build always. This will also help in your case because when you get more budget and time, you can push new features easily. </p>\n\n<p>I think the other best quality of a software product is how it handles exceptions and respond to exceptional scenarios. Most programs fails to handle this gracefully. They either get killed by unhandled excpetions or they produce meaningless error messages which confuses the user. </p>\n\n<p>Creating bug free software is not a simple job. It will happen eventually as and when the program evolves. But it is programmers duty to make sure enough information is available to debug the issue. One good example of how to produce excellent error messages to user is <a href=\"http://www.virtualbox.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">VirtualBox</a>.

    "\n\nHuman: <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> <em>My business partner has blocked me from contacting him personally and no longer contributes to our business. Is it necessary to inform him that I no longer will be performing my responsibilities as outlined in our agreement?</em></p>\n\n<p>My co-founder 'Bob' and I have a Partnership Agreement to run a small online business - a Youtube channel along with a few social media accounts. His responsibilities were research and recording audio; mine were research, video production, and running the social media accounts. Our venture has not earned any money. Bob also was my long distance relationship boyfriend.</p>\n\n<p>Bob's contribution since the beginning of the venture has been up-and-down. There were a few weeks in which he would record as per the schedule we agreed upon, and then stop after a minor setback (ie. our videos did not receive views/comments). I would ask him from time to time to return to schedule, but he asked me to stop doing so. He did, however, buy a ~$30 microphone to record, of his own volition. He never stated that he no longer wanted to be business partners. I take responsibility for being too lax in negotiating.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I kept to the video production schedule, and I have updated (and continue to update) the social media accounts everyday.</p>\n\n<p>A few months ago Bob and I broke up amicably, but did not discuss what to do with the business. I continued updating the social media accounts during that time. After about a month or so to let the steam cool, I called Bob up to say that I was still interested in running the business and if he was interested in continuing our SOLELY business partnership. He indicated that he was interested in recording again.</p>\n\n<p>The next day I found out that Bob had blocked my personal lines of contact to him.</p>\n\n<p>I have not tried contacting him since then, but I have continued to update the social media accounts. I am no longer interested in doing so, and would like to know if it would be necessary to inform Bob, who is still in a Partnership Agreement with me, that I will no longer be performing my responsibilities as outlined in the agreement. He has not blocked the business's e-mail or social media accounts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> OP here. To clarify further, as this looks to be a point of confusion, Bob has not performed his responsibilities to the business since several weeks before we broke up. All in all, thank you everyone for your responses and advice.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

Most employers are far more willing to wait a week than call up second preferences, who would then have to decide, give a week, etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>As to your current employer, there is no 'good' way of telling them you don't want to work your notice period.</strong></p>\n\n<p>You could ask them... but it's generally not a good idea to tell an employer you're leaving them unless you have a job to go to that you can 100% definitely take up.</p>\n\n<p>If you can't change it, it is a breach of contract for you to leave without working your notice. In practice, unless your employer enjoys being petty, or there is a specific penalty clause in your contract, they are unlikely to pursue you legally (NB: none of this is <em>advice</em> in the legal/employment sense: rely on your union or solicitor for that).</p>\n\n<p>If you have a two week notice period, it is typically because your employer is just giving you the legal minimum based on your length of service and asking for the same in return. Two weeks is not enough to hire a replacement, it's a window for knowledge transfer at best.

Would you be willing to let me go on Friday - I'm willing to do Y and Z to make this work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, if they do say no, they will know that you have considered leaving, and so they might start to look to replace you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You always have the option of not taking the new job.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Your old employer needn't ever know you got a new job.

If you can find a few publicly available examples or some recommendations from an official source, you can make a much stronger case. You want to come across as \"constructive\" and as looking out for \"the best of the company\"</p>\n",

            " <p>This is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_continuity_planning#Business_continuity\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>business continuity</em></a> issue. Some of the other answers are focusing on how to approach the idea of working from home for yourself, but that isn't the real problem here.</p>\n\n<p>You say your company is a relatively large organisation, and it has in-house IT (you, and your department). Therefore it will have someone in charge of disaster recovery and business continuity already working on this. They have probably done or are currently doing a risk assessment. So far they haven't determined the risk to the business very high, but that might change.</p>\n\n<p>The overall risk is not only to you, or your coworkers, but to the business (and in the wider sense the overall economy). Let's play this through, from the view of the company.</p>\n\n<p>Assume half the staff gets ill. They don't have to be seriously ill, just unable to work. If 250 of 500 people can't go to work, chances are the company will not produce any products or services in that time. SLAs with customers will not be fulfilled, leading to penalty payments. Customers will leave. If there is production, machines need to be stopped, which is costly (think car factory). All the running costs, in particular salaries and buildings and things like this will still have to be paid, but there is no revenue. That means the company will lose money fast. And with its liquidity it will lose the ability to pay your salary. You will lose your job, and the company will fold. </p>\n\n<p>A recent example <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/05/flybe-collapses-as-covid-19-triggers-fall-in-airline-bookings\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">of this already happening is Flybe</a>, where CoVID-19 has been named as something like the last drop (credibility of this source unclear). </p>\n\n<p>Now what does that mean for you? It's hard to say. The risk assessment isn't your job, but you can take precautions.</p>\n\n<p>No-one will blame you for voicing your concerns in this situation, even if that is not part of your job. If you have already got infrastructure in place to work from home, use it. They are likely not going to question you. In particular if your commute involves busy public transport, there are lots of good arguments to not go to work. The main argumentation is not to keep yourself from getting sick, but from spreading the virus (or other illnesses that someone else might contract in addition to the virus because their immune system is weakened) into the office.</p>\n\n<p>My suggestion is to ask your manager about business continuity plans. Looks at what companies around you are doing. If you have a spouse you live with, has their company sent everyone home? These are good arguments to give them.</p>\n\n<p>Your company's business continuity team might be well prepared and currently executing risk mitigation, or it might not. In either case, they will appreciate that some people are aware and conscious of the situation.</p>\n"

(i.e. if my boss needs me for handover or something).</p>\n\n<p>This Thursday I told my direct manager that I will not renew my contract and he told me that he needs me for two months (so that is one month more than I have calculated initially) so I can help in finding a replacement, train them, handover all my current projects to them. And he told me that the period might be one month only depending on how fast we find a replacement and when can they join.</p>\n\n<p>Right now I am kind of embarrassed to talk to my future employer and tell them that I might join them later. I feel like it was my mistake was that I signed the job offer and gave them an expected start date before talking to my manager.\nWhat is the right approach to handle this?\nShould I negotiate with my current manager on the notice period?\nShould I just be honest to my future employer about the hand over?

Going down that sort of path opens up your current company to legal action on your part - and that would probably be worse for your manager than you simply leaving (even if it is only a threat and not an actual action)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>On a related note, when you make the job change you could also offer to help your old company outside of normal work hours as a favor to them (for a fee - think contracting rates and then shamelessly multiply that number by 2).  Doing so will make lessen the impression that you are burning bridges when you leave.</p>\n",

I considered lunch/drink, but I can't afford. </p>\n\n<p>Cards + chocolate (or any other good option also fine) @desk - I am fine with this idea, have seen people doing it.

Why things happened isn't important here, only that there was a failure and people stepped up and fixed it.</p>\n\n<p>For me, I would take the time to write up a nice email. Ideally you want this email to reach the respective people and their managers. You may want to make sure it's okay to contact their managers through your manager. The email should be <em>very</em> brief. Simply pointing out who you'd like to thank, that there was an outage and despite being on vacation people stepped up to see it fixed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Expressing your gratitude</strong></p>\n\n<p>Your code blew up in production, it may have been a mistake, or could have been just what was right then was wrong now, regardless these people could have just ignored the issue and left it as \"your problem\".</p>\n\n<p>They didn't, they rolled up their sleeves and helped you out. Again arguable that's \"their job\" but again they could have just not answered the phone, or just said \"sorry man, I'm no where near a computer to help\" (or other excuse)</p>\n\n<p>So you feel both thankful and guilty they had to work during their vacation. You should contact them as individually as practical to give them a personal thank you. If we're talking a dozen or so people contacting them individually would be best, if we're talking like fifty you're probably better off thanking them based on team, etc.</p>\n\n<p>I wouldn't apologize per se, we all make mistakes, but do make a point to thank them for helping you out with the issue despite being on vacation and that you truly appreciate it.</p>\n",
            " <p>Never ever shout about issues that came up because of something you did which had a negative impact on system.</p>\n\n<p>You may want to act nice to let everyone know but then you going to degrade your performance.</p>\n\n<p>It's a workplace - get over it. They helped you, you help them when they are in trouble that's how you balance such matters... Not by buying people gifts..</p>\n"

The good point is that nobody will never address you any reproaches for doing stupid things if the policies or the rules enforced it.\nAnother good point is that if the the rule is smart or/and useful, even people that doesn't understand it will stick to it.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to work with Japanese people or in Japan, you should start changing a bit, and accept that sometimes you'll have to do stupid things because your boss or your client told you so.</p>\n",
            " <p>Consider the company's point of view. What if every job candidate had different preferred software? Now they have to install dozens of different software packages and learn to use them. That would be a giant administrative pain.</p>\n\n<p>And think about what it says about you as a potential employee if you refuse to use the company's preferred software. Suppose you get the job. Are you going to refuse to use the company email system and insist on using your own? Are you going to refuse to write company documents in Word and insist on using Open Office? Are you going to refuse to write your programs in C# and insist on using VB? Are you going to demand that they buy you a special chair and use your preferred brand of coffee maker in the break room? Etc.</p>\n\n<p>There are big advantages to a company if everybody is using the same tools. Sure, there are times when there is good reason to break the pattern and do something different. If a company says \"We always use Microsoft products. You say that in this case where there are overwhelming advantages to using a non-Microsoft project? No, you don't understand, let me explain again. We always use Microsoft products.\", sure, that's foolish and narrow-minded and inflexible. </p>\n\n<p>But it is perfectly reasonable to say, \"We conduct all our tele-meetings with Skype so that our people only need to install one telemeeting product on their computers, and anyone who has that software installed can participate in any meeting. We don't doubt that other products may have advantages, but those advantages are not enough to outweigh the convenience of everyone using the same standard product.\"</p>\n",
            " <p>\"Skype is spyware\": Citation needed.</p>\n\n<p>Fact of the matter is, Skype is simply the most stable videoconferencing product out there.  I once had an interview with a company who asked me to use a lesser-known one (Zoom or something?), and I spent the first 15 minutes trying to set it up after being told that a Linux client existed when it was highly unstable and wouldn't even load on my computer.  Subsequently we tried using Google Hangouts, which connected but the communication was very unstable, so we ended up just using Skype in the end.  I passed the interview anyway, but it would have been much smoother on both sides if we had just used Skype to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>As for why no telephone interview, I'm not exactly sure; what I do know is that many Japanese companies have an obsession with video conferencing.  Perhaps it's because \"we're a tech company we shouldn't use telephones\" or something, I don't know.  But I've never had a phone interview with a Japanese company.  In any case, Skype is much cheaper to use than a long-distance phone call, so that could be a reason too.</p>\n\n<p>Just install Skype and use it.  Uninstall it later if you don't like it, or use a throwaway account, or whatever.</p>\n",

And Skype is not considered spyware. \nSadly a decent amount of user tracking and convenience over anonymity / user liberty/ security / data protection is the norm these days.</p>\n\n<p>They have their company solution to do interview (and other calls) and they follow that. I'd find it a bit inflexible to not fall back to a normal telephone conversation, but that they are not too keen on installing other software is totally normal. Some companies where individual employees have a lot of individual responsibility and freedom might accept that, but I would not expect that you can dictate to any company how the interview is done.</p>\n\n<p>Now what does it say about the company? It's probably decently large. The larger a company gets the more it tends to follow policies / company wide solutions to standard problems and adhere to them. There are exceptions where individuals / individual departments have large freedoms, but this seems to be a company that has a tight organisation - at least if the HR department is indicative of the rest of the company.</p>\n\n<p>So while it's not ultimately bad, it might just not be an environment where you would want to work. If you prefer flexibility, individual decisions and or a focus on data protection / user empowerment / open source software, then this could indicate that this is not the right company for you. However, sometimes different departments in the same company are run totally different. While the HR department might have strict rules and use mass market software, other departments might be run different. E.g. in many companies the default operating system is Windows (along with central administration), but people in certain departments are allowed to install their own OS on their work machine and manage their machine themselves (but don't get the same support in maintaining it). Whether this is the case, you won't find out if you don't get an interview.</p>\n\n<p>But if you have enough other options, then this can be a quick filter that sorts out companies you likely don't fit with anyway.</p>\n\n<p><em>Options to manage the problem as good as possible</em>: As many companies do use Skype for their remote interview calls, you might want to try and get past that step to see if they are generally a bad fit or whether this is the only thing you don't like while minimising the \"impact\" on you. I'm assuming here that you either don't want to install Skype on your machine, as you consider it spyware, and/or that you don't want to identify yourself towards Microsoft when using Skype. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ask to use normal telephone instead (in this case you tried and did not succeed, but still this, is relatively likely an option,at least compared to suggesting other software based options) </li>\n<li>Use web-skype, that way you avoid an installation of something you consider spyware, you still require an account though</li>\n<li>If you feel really paranoid about it, you might also use a Linux distribution on a USB stick to boot into that instead of your normal OS and either install Skype there or use web skype from that system</li>\n<li>if you want to avoid providing your real phone number when creating a throwaway account, you can try to use an online service that allows you to read sms to mobile numbers provided by them online (google for concrete services); however, those numbers are often black-listed by big companies soon after they go online it seems. So you might have to try a few times till you manage to open an account with one of them. And you run the risk that it is shut-down by Skype should they find out afterwards (no idea what their policy is regarding the usage of such phone numbers). You might want to make sure that is not illegal where you live depending on how harsh your government looks at attempts to stay anonymous.</li>\n<li>buy a cheap/used phone with a prepaid sim card, install Skype there and use it only for your interviews, then get rid of both (or re-install the system on the phone), same option applies to a laptop</li>\n<li>ask in an internet cafe if they can install Skype for you; even if they don't have it on there as a default, they might be fine with installing it. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Personal Opinion</em>: To me it's funny that Skype is now adapted all over the place in corporations when it stopped being the leading solution that works without problems cross-platform quite a while ago. Due to that one might see a fixation on Skype as a (tiny) indicator of a company trying to catch up with the times, but still quite a bit behind. But I personally wouldn't use that as a sole discriminator to go ahead or not with an interview process.</p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p>For a long time I was the only developer at my company.  Last year, we hired two more entry level devs.  I have no management experience or training and very few managerial duties, but by virtue of my seniority I am in a position of some authority and on paper they report to me.  Point is, calling me a terrible manager is not helpful.  I expect I am, but I want to know how to improve.</p>\n\n<p>We have a morning meeting where my team is expected to report to me their progress the past day and set goals for the new day.  I can then report to the boss (owner) what the team is up to.  The boss has repeatedly pushed to set an 8 am start for the work day, but this was unpopular and I have been able to hold our meetings to 10 am instead.  The meeting is consistently punctual.  If I call the meeting at 10:01 I consider myself late.  This is important to me since I feel that if I don't respect my own schedule why should the team?</p>\n\n<p>Lately (over the past few months), one of our team members has been consistently showing up for work later and later.  I didn't say anything since I don't want to send the message that obeying some clock is more important than getting your work done, and the employee has been consistently putting in his 40 hours a week (I can verify this, since we are required to punch a time clock).  My gut says that the quality of his work has suffered, but I do not have solid objective evidence of that.</p>\n\n<p>It has become a bit of a problem now though because he is showing up late for the morning meetings.  Once last week and now two days in a row last week.  I have asked him if there is anything going on or if he needs any sort of accommodation from the company.  He said no, that he was sorry and that he would try to be on time.   This was a couple weeks ago and he has not improved.  I have asked the other dev if he knows anything and he says he does not.</p>\n\n<p>At this point I do not feel that pushing the meeting back further will help.  All of us were able to make the 8:00 - 8:30 start time when the boss was breathing down our necks about it.  He knows it, we know it.  I am concerned that if I do not come up with a solution the boss will re-impose stricter rules and my team will lose some of the flexibility that we now enjoy.  What sort or carrots or sticks might I offer to prevent this from happening?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>I believe the answer is in your description of the problem. I would tell your developer that if he doesn't show up for the meeting at the regular time, the boss will set it back to the 8am timeframe, and that would be worse for everyone. Also asking (or reminding him) about the upcoming meeting next day at the end of the work day may also help, because it will show him that you care and it is important.</p>\n\n<p>If he continues to show up late, then you may have no choice than talking to your boss and possibly have a conversation (the three of you) about it to sort it out.</p>\n",
            " <blockquote>\n  <p>I don't want to send the message that obeying some clock is more important than getting your work done</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But in this case it is important, because not obeying the clock prevents work from getting done.</p>\n\n<p>Every minute he is late for the meeting is a minute you spend waiting for him. These are two minutes where you and the other worker are unproductive while on the clock.</p>\n\n<p>There are two possible courses of action:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Authoritarian approach: Make him understand that being late for meetings is wasting the time of you and your colleague and insist that he is punctual. Being on-time for meetings is part of professionalism.</li>\n<li>Diplomatic approach: Although 10am is already quite late to show up for work in most cultures, the time could still be inconvenient for him. You could push the meeting further back to ensure that everyone is present, like after lunch.</li>\n</ol>\n",
            " <p>The first thing I am thinking - why the quality of work is worse because he starts later? Also you said its just a gut feeling. So I guess now the first thing is to find out how to measure the real quality.</p>\n\n<p>If it turns out the real quality is bad, then just say him - we are going to cut your salary, because your quality is worse than it is needed for this salary. </p>\n\n<p>If it turns out that the quality is not getting worse, then I think there is no problem with him coming later - <strong>its an advantage of the company of having flexible hours</strong> and in result - happier worker, more loyal worker.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand - worker is not listening what the boss is telling him to do. There is good reason to tell - if you will not listen what we are telling - we don't need you at the company.</p>\n\n<p>There is another side of this problem. Is the company good enough for the worker so he cares about trying to be good worker. Chances are that he does not get what he wants from the company and maybe his salary is also not the one which makes him to be afraid of being fired, then the solution should be - to find out what he wants from the company to be happy and then ask from him seriously - if he stops being late - he gets what he wants from the company (if possible).</p>\n\n<p>One more thing - salary raise might not be biggest motivator. But with the bigger salary offer you can put advertisement that you are searching worker, one of the important requirements is - be at work not too late. And if you are lucky - you find better worker and problem is solved.</p>\n\n<p>Before putting an advertisement - again talk with the worker seriously - if he does not stop being late, then we are going to find new one and you will be replaced. And give him last chance to improve.</p>\n\n<p>I think good chances are that company is low on budget since it might be small company and so not possible to give big salary or other benefits.</p>\n\n<p>But then it would be the similar as asking - how can I get a Ferrari but having budget only for Opel Vectra.</p>\n\n<p>So if the company is not as good as it tries to find good worker, then probably it should just to be happy while he is working and bringing some profit even if it is not the highest possible profit. </p>\n\n<p>The Opel Vectra will not drive you to the destination at same speed as Ferrri, but it still will drive :)</p>\n\n<p>Or if you think its not profitable to keep him then again - fire him.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am not saying to do things blindly cause they might put negative effect. Those which I mention - is just to go through logical steps. </p>\n\n<p>For example - tell him we will cut salary - now we go to next step thinking - is it would it really be good or would it be bad. If this is not the case, then what else options we have. And so on. And then if we don't have any good options, then if he brings profit at least small - we keep him, if he does not - fire him.</p>\n\n<p>Also we need to think about long term profit and small term profit. And what are the chances that he will stay so we finally are at a time which we think is long enough term.</p>\n",
            " <p>As someone in development and oversees others there are things to be addressed here.</p>\n\n<p>The Boss wanted the meetings first thing in the morning (8am) and you as a team persuaded him to give you some freedom to push it to 10am... 10am is a very late start to the day in most of the world. Not being able to make it reliably to work by 10am is a problem.</p>\n\n<p>There are several ways to tackle this problem, all have their pros and cons to be considered. (I will be including some that are perhaps less ethical)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cause</strong></p>\n\n<p>WHY is this person chronically late? Do they depend on others for transportation? Have something they do before work that's been going long as of late? Feel there are no consequences likely to come of this? Simply not care anymore?</p>\n\n<p>There could be very valid reasons for the repeated tardiness. If you could get to the bottom of it to know \"Why\" you're better able to help resolve the problem. (Find an alternate form of transportation, set priorities, or take disciplinary action for example)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Authority</strong></p>\n\n<p>The authority approach tends to be the go to traditional approach. It's rather effective short term but really unpopular with the staff. Basically it's \"You need to be here by 10am or we'll find someone else who will.\" We all prefer to be good people who trust our employees to do the right thing with only a little prodding as needed, sometimes when people get complacent you have to give them a little kick to remind them they do have obligations to meet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Diplomacy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some people are very receptive to what is effectively bribery. Find something they want you can reasonably provide. Salary increases actually are only marginally effective here. (unless their underpaid) but everyone has something they want perhaps soda, coffee, the occasional thank you, etc. Find something this person wants you can offer... IF they can get to work on time reliably.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Exclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>A common tactic is provide a reason for the person to WANT to be there on time. fresh coffee, donuts, bagels, etc available at the meeting in limited quantities. Well meeting is at 10am break out the bagels then, if people are still hungry they eat a second one, if there's none left when he strolls in late, well that's just a shame isn't it?</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE: The below are NOT serious answers but will likely prove satisfying to the frustrated troll who wants to lash out inappropriate ways</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Evil Diplomacy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Diplomacy can also be used as a public shaming tactic. It's pretty shady stuff, but sometimes it's your most effective route. (might not work for you with such a small team) Offer to buy the team lunch IF EVERYONE shows up on time reliably for X amount of time. If this guy drops the ball it'll piss off his coworkers. Sometimes employees feel less guilty about letting down a supervisor then the person that works along side them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Even more Evil Diplomacy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Give some benefit to everyone who was on time reliably. Make the lunch proposition for the team, then say you felt guilty about not giving the team lunch because of one person's actions than take the rest of the team out without them. This is truly not nice stuff, and honestly is pretty lousy, but tends to bring things to head. (usually by that person quitting)</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Final Solution</strong> (yes I knew that's in poor taste)</p>\n\n<p>Start the meeting at 10am, when he strolls in late fire him on the spot.

            " <p>This topic is a big favorite of mine, or more specifically: the topic of establishing \"rules of conduct\" for a team. A lot of times I see rules being established and enforced, without much thought being spent on the actual value of that rule. </p>\n\n<p>So what's the value of being on time, in other words having mandatory time where people are working? Most times, this boils down to being available for other people, so called office hours, or participating in meetings. If you can keep the mandatory available hours to say, 6 out of a total of 8 hours of daily work, in general you'll see an increase in productivity since people can adjust their working hours to the times they are productive. Both in the sense of morning people working earlier, as well as leaving early when you're having a bad day and staying late when you're \"in the zone\"</p>\n\n<p>So how to enforce the hours when we actually want people to be available? The principle to use here is to steal some warfare psychology: a soldier is not loyal to his generals (management), but to the people next to him in the trench (team members). So instead of saying \"I expect you all to be here from time x to time y every day\", gather the team and explain to them that you'd like to have 6 hours every day when they are available, and let them decide for themselves what these times should be. Reoccurring meetings should then be placed within the timeframe of these hours, and no one should get any criticism for being out of office outside of these times (with exceptions for specific meetings/commitments etc).</p>\n\n<p>And then to finally answer the question, how do you deal with a team member consistently showing up late? Gather the team every now and then (for instance the retrospective if you're doing Scrum), show them the list of rules that they themselves (with your facilitation) have come up with, and have them talk about which ones are not working and why. This will have a greater impact than any way you yourself can motivate/threaten/manipulate the teammember to show up on time</p>\n",
            " <p>When he says \"<em>no, that he was sorry and that he would try to be on time</em>\" he is telling you <strong>there isn't really a reason for him being late</strong>. At least, nothing he thinks you can help him with.</p>\n\n<p>Many workplaces have a flexible time schedule, but still have \"core hours\" which everybody should be present for. You could try implementing a similar rule.</p>\n\n<p>He may not understand the importance of being on time. If he gets his work done, so what? That is where you need to explain to him why it is important. (<em>assuming it is important</em>). Since it sounds like you did that already, and he is still being late, maybe it <strong>still isn't important to <em>him</em>.</strong> What repercussions will this behavior have on him if he continues to be late? The answer to that question may be \"important enough\" for him to start showing up on time.</p>\n\n<p>He could still have a legitimate issue - though if you follow the paragraph above and he still won't tell you why he has such a hard time then his issue could be something extremely personal <em>(<strong>Depression</strong> comes to mind - can make it difficult to get out of bed)</em>. He may just not like the job, or the people he's working with.  These would all affect his work performance as well. The problem with an issue like these is that he won't want to admit it and he may not even be aware of it, but so long as you ask if there is a problem and he says \"no\"... unless you see obvious signs that he needs help (<em>Which means, you should recommend getting help. Or even push him to get help</em>) there isn't much you can recommend or do about his problem - It may be he just isn't a good fit for the company.</p>\n\n<p>I would just try letting him know the consequences of his actions first. You seem like you are understanding and want to work this out with him. He should see that as well. Just know you may end up having to fire him if the cost of his lateness is too high.</p>\n",
            " <p>You have at least three issues here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>you and the other dev waiting for him to join the morning meeting is wasting time and perhaps upsetting the two of you</li>\n<li>he would like flex time, to come in when he likes as long as he hits 40 hours and gets his stuff done, but the morning meeting is interfering with that now</li>\n<li>you think overall his quality of work dropped when he shifted his work hours, but you're not entirely sure on that one</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Why not try this: make it an end-of-day meeting instead of a morning meeting. Nobody can leave until it has been held. Schedule it for [length-of-meeting] minutes before whenever a 40-hour-a-week person would leave if they came in at 8. (If such a person would leave at 4, hold it at 3:45.]</p>\n\n<p>Now you can all talk about what you did today, and what you will continue to do if you're not leaving yet, and what you'll be doing first thing tomorrow before LateGuy is in. You can cover all the same bases as a morning meeting but without having to wait for LateGuy. What's more, the early people can take action at 8am if they learn from LateGuy that such action needs to be taken. </p>\n\n<p>If you do this, he is now free to have his flex time (within reason - he can't work 8pm to 4am or you wouldn't be able to have a meeting.) Perhaps with the tension removed, his productivity and quality will go back to where they were. Perhaps he'll start coming in at 11, or noon, or 3, and you'll have to drill more deeply into what is happening and how the company feels about it. But more likely he will arrive roughly between 9:30 and 10:30 most days, and get to work, and you'll be fine.</p>\n\n<p>If it turns out that end-of-day meetings just don't work and you and the other on-time arriver are suffering with an end of day meeting, then you have to tell him that he must regularize his hours enough that there is a time in the morning (and not 11:59 either) when you can be sure he will be in so that a morning meeting can be held. Get his agreement on a time and then if you must, get the boss to make it clear that being in by that time is a condition of employment. But don't go there until you've given end of day meetings a fair try. That should increase the chances he'll agree to a reasonable schedule for beginning of day ones if they're vital.</p>\n\n<p>(By the way, my guess is that he's recently started an evening activity -- online gaming, or a new significant other, or square dancing -- and is staying up later and later every night in some semi-addictive spiral, then having a harder and harder time getting up in the morning. His tiredness is causing the quality lapse, and he resists your actions because he tells himself that he will stop earlier tonight and not have a problem any more. If this is what's happening he may spiral himself right out of a job, or the initial excitement may wear off and he may go back to a more normal rhythm. But you can't manage assuming this is the case, hence my suggestion for a reasonable rearrangement, at least as an experiment.)</p>\n",

Pointless meetings are a productivity killer for a developer so my advice would be change the format of the information exchange and limit the face time so it becomes important and not just something to do.</p>\n\n<p>Some food for thought:\nI solve some of the biggest work problems laying in bed at 2 in the morning. I can't sleep if its on my mind, it keeps me up and I keep trying to solve it.  I wouldn't care to even remember the problem it if I'm worried its 2 am and I have to get to a meeting to talk about the crap I did yesterday instead of fixing things that matter.</p>\n\n<p>Enforcing strict time will get you the warm body in the door, but the brain is a far more valuable commodity.

            " <p>The first thing you need to do is discuss this with your boss.  There are two potential goals for this meeting </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Acquire the power necessary to take any action necessary to ensure compliance; or,</li>\n<li>Ask your boss to step in.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A \"manager\" who does not have hire/fire capabilities is, in my opinion, not really a manager.  The people you manage will ultimately walk all over you if they feel that you have zero ability to create or enforce the rules.</p>\n\n<p>So, if I were in your shoes, I'd go to the boss and ask him to empower me such that I actually have the authority necessary for the position I hold.  A good boss will give that to you.  Then you can have a private talk with the individual and explain to them that the work day starts at 9:00am or whatever it is you prefer.  </p>\n\n<p>If your boss is unwilling to give you such authority, then you will need him to step in and have this talk with that individual.  Certainly this path is easier for you, but, quite frankly, if you want a real management role you should be shooting for the first option.</p>\n\n<p>I understand developers often dislike working when the rest of the world is engaged; I was one for many years.  However, I also understand that there are a lot of reasons that being at their desk when the rest of the world is available can also be very important.  </p>\n",
            " <p>A conference call could be a viable option as an alternate way to attend.

You have other things to do. I'm afraid a plan is going to need to set some realistic goals (no more than one missed day a week/month) and there have to be consequences for not complying.</p>\n\n<p>For whatever reason, your boss thinks this is important, so you should have support on being able to deal with this person. I hope it doesn't come to that. It seems like you're willing to be flexible and this person may be taking advantage of the situation. Also consider how he behaves at the meeting. Is he reluctant to talk with others? He gets things done so he should have any issues with not wanting to discuss any failures.</p>\n",
            " <p>I'm such an employee who likes to show up late. My reasons are that I like the nightlife I'm not a morning person and that I'm not satisfied with my job. </p>\n\n<p>If my manager were to give me an ultimatum 'show up on time or we will fire you', I would show up on time, but I would also be spending most of my time looking for another job. If he does not do that then nothing is likely to change. It might be a sign this developer thinks he is underpaid and he doesnt think his job is all that valuable. So before you issue such an ultimatum do a cost/benefit analysis (cost of replacement).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Clarification:</strong> I see three options for a manager dealing with someone like me:</p>\n\n<p>The softer approach is to mostly ignore the situation and maybe talk about it without issueing an ultimatum. this is what my manager does. This never hurts however it might not help very much. </p>\n\n<p>If the analysis turns out that the cost of replacement is less than the benefits of somebody showing up on time, then its good to go with a 'hard' approach and issue an ultimatum. </p>\n\n<p>The last option is if this person is not easy to replace and you really need him in your meeting at 10. Then you might consider the 'appeasement' approach and try to make a deal. Listen to what he wants so he will show up on time. What I do not recommend is a 'bluff' approach of issuing an ultimatum even if the cost of replacement is higher than the benefit of your dev showing up on time. </p>\n"

Nobody can leave until it has been held. Schedule it for [length-of-meeting] minutes before whenever a 40-hour-a-week person would leave if they came in at 8. (If such a person would leave at 4, hold it at 3:45.]</p>\n\n<p>Now you can all talk about what you did today, and what you will continue to do if you're not leaving yet, and what you'll be doing first thing tomorrow before LateGuy is in. You can cover all the same bases as a morning meeting but without having to wait for LateGuy. What's more, the early people can take action at 8am if they learn from LateGuy that such action needs to be taken. </p>\n\n<p>If you do this, he is now free to have his flex time (within reason - he can't work 8pm to 4am or you wouldn't be able to have a meeting.) Perhaps with the tension removed, his productivity and quality will go back to where they were. Perhaps he'll start coming in at 11, or noon, or 3, and you'll have to drill more deeply into what is happening and how the company feels about it. But more likely he will arrive roughly between 9:30 and 10:30 most days, and get to work, and you'll be fine.</p>\n\n<p>If it turns out that end-of-day meetings just don't work and you and the other on-time arriver are suffering with an end of day meeting, then you have to tell him that he must regularize his hours enough that there is a time in the morning (and not 11:59 either) when you can be sure he will be in so that a morning meeting can be held. Get his agreement on a time and then if you must, get the boss to make it clear that being in by that time is a condition of employment. But don't go there until you've given end of day meetings a fair try. That should increase the chances he'll agree to a reasonable schedule for beginning of day ones if they're vital.</p>\n\n<p>(By the way, my guess is that he's recently started an evening activity -- online gaming, or a new significant other, or square dancing -- and is staying up later and later every night in some semi-addictive spiral, then having a harder and harder time getting up in the morning. His tiredness is causing the quality lapse, and he resists your actions because he tells himself that he will stop earlier tonight and not have a problem any more. If this is what's happening he may spiral himself right out of a job, or the initial excitement may wear off and he may go back to a more normal rhythm. But you can't manage assuming this is the case, hence my suggestion for a reasonable rearrangement, at least as an experiment.)</p>\n",
        "rejected_target": " <p>The first thing you need to do is discuss this with your boss.  There are two potential goals for this meeting </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Acquire the power necessary to take any action necessary to ensure compliance; or,</li>\n<li>Ask your boss to step in.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A \"manager\" who does not have hire/fire capabilities is, in my opinion, not really a manager.  The people you manage will ultimately walk all over you if they feel that you have zero ability to create or enforce the rules.</p>\n\n<p>So, if I were in your shoes, I'd go to the boss and ask him to empower me such that I actually have the authority necessary for the position I hold.  A good boss will give that to you.  Then you can have a private talk with the individual and explain to them that the work day starts at 9:00am or whatever it is you prefer.  </p>\n\n<p>If your boss is unwilling to give you such authority, then you will need him to step in and have this talk with that individual.

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I'm currently a 24 yr old contract-to-hire developer at this company. I'm five months in to a six month contract. My job title is \"Developer.\" No prefix. I'm between Junior/Entry-Level and Senior. I'm on a team with two senior developers, one of which is driving me insane.</p>\n\n<p>He constantly talks down to me like I don't know what I'm doing. It's one thing if he's helping me with a process that's unique to how the company's data or services are structured, but he is always telling me the most fundamental tips about programming that are not company specific. He's telling me how to be a developer as if I've never programed before. This is not just simple hazing or \"new guy\" kind of talking. My impression is that he honestly seems to think I can't do my job. I will say on his behalf that he doesn't say it with a demeaning tone or with any kind of annoyance. I think he does mean well.</p>\n\n<p>I know I'm young, but I do have a lot of experience including seven years of work experience and a few first and second place awards on the national level. I feel insulted by his comments.</p>\n\n<p>This is the best paying job I've ever had and I moved across the country to work here. He is a strong reason for why I'm thinking of throwing all that away and not staying with the company when the contract is up.</p>\n\n<p>It's been five months and I've done plenty of good work. I'm running out of ways to show him that I don't want to be treated this way. How can I get the point across to him while keeping it professional? Or, perhaps, how can I keep my sanity and feeling of self worth if he continues?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: He is not my boss or team lead. We work on the same level in the team.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>How likely do you think it is for you to find other people like this in other workplaces? Seriously ponder this question for a moment as the guy may be technically skilled but not great at dealing with people which may be something you'll encounter in fields like IT where specialized skills can be sought and others find ways to work with difficult people that may be more than a bit eccentric at times.</p>\n\n<p>The conversation I suggest you have with him is about your background and that the tips he points out aren't needed. In a way this is more about how you are being treated as perhaps he doesn't know how much this agitates you. While I can see in your post you are more than a little rattled, I wonder how well is he supposed to know this? Avoidance just keeps the same cycle going as he may think this is useful and just keep at it. After all, what are you telling him that should lead him to think otherwise?</p>\n\n<p>Before the conversation be sure to have a few examples of what was pointed so that you can reference examples and possibly see if you could brainstorm solutions to this as I doubt this will be the only time you come across this kind of co-worker.</p>\n",
            " <p>Do you learn from this guy?</p>\n\n<p>I have been in a similar situation, being talked down to etc, but the individual also taught me a lot, albeit in a condescending way.</p>\n\n<p>I rejected this person at the time as I felt that they were targeting me specifically. I only saw the negative and I wish I could go back and let them know that I have changed my view, but some people, especially in IT, aren't the most people friendly, and learning how to work with those people is a skill in itself which can be rewarding too as there is often a lot to learn from them.</p>\n\n<p>My point is that if you find that you do learn and improve as a result of this person, who it sounds like is taking a special interest in you, then it might be an idea to learn to cope with their personality and use this as an opportunity to become a better developer.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, when somebody sees potential in somebody else and they know that the person could do better, they express this in less than ideal ways.</p>\n\n<p>If not, then maybe start looking for another job.</p>\n",
            " <p>\"How can I get the point across to him while keeping it professional?\"</p>\n\n<p>Does he tell you the same things over and over,  indicating that he isn't paying attention to what you are saying?  A gentle reminder might be in order (gravely nod and say \"yes, I remember you telling me that yesterday.\") and fast forward him to what you need to learn(...and what I'd really like to know is...\")</p>\n\n<p>Or is he covering new ground, just things you already know?  If this is the case, just nod and wait until he takes a breath or there is a polite point of entry into the conversation, and ask him about some aspects of the process that you <em>don't</em> know.  Find ways to learn more than you already know.  He's a senior level guy; if you can't find ways to steer him into giving you useful information then it sounds as if you are more concerned with what you already know than what you don't know.  That's an attitude that could be deadly to your career.</p>\n\n<p>Many times on job interviews I have been given questions to answer and I could not answer them; often I find out that what they really wanted to know was how I reacted when I didn't know the answer.  Often, what you know isn't as important as how well you learn, and how you react to instruction.  Especially when you are only 24 years old.  If that last statement stung a bit, it sounds as if you may be partly causing your own problem.</p>\n\n<p>Push yourself to learn more.  Go to your coworker with more advanced questions.  That's the best way to divert him from the basics; prove that you are ready and able to discuss advanced concepts.  And above all, focus on what you want to learn, <em>not</em> what you know.</p>\n\n<p>\"Or, perhaps, how can I keep my sanity and feeling of self worth if he continues?\"</p>\n\n<p>You can keep your sanity by not basing your feelings of self worth on whether or not this guy you work with acknowledges how much you know, and instead focus on doing your job, improving and getting along with people.  I don't think there is anyone, anywhere who is appreciated as much as they feel they deserve.  And people who focus on getting respect rather than deserving it spend their whole lives chasing the wind.</p>\n",
            " <p>The short answer is you have to take control of the conversations.  You have allowed him to have control.</p>\n\n<p>Begin by asking very pointed, direct questions, and even then only when necessary.  If you ask open-ended questions, he is (apparently) the type that will take that opportunity to lecture.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of asking \"How does the consumables tracking module work with the client billing module?\"  ask him, \"Do you have the interface specification between the consumables tracking module and the client billing module?\"  Then if he starts to explain what consumables are or why you need to bill the client, you have every reason to say, \"I hate to interrupt, but I'm already familiar with both the systems, and I'd really like to get working on this interface issue right away.  Can you please give the the interface specification.\"</p>\n\n<p>Obviously that's pretty specific for the purpose of an example, but by tightening the focus of your questions, you demonstrate your familiarity and competence with the technologies, and present yourself as a \"business-only, get-it-done\" type, which is not necessarily rare, but somewhat unexpected from your age group.</p>\n\n<p>If he's well-meaning, as you said you believe, a couple of weeks of this should change his dynamic with you.  If he's trying to prop himself up at your expense, then he'll soon see you as unsuitable for that purpose, and find a new \"apprentice.\"  Either way, he should stop treating you in the manner that you are frustrated by.</p>\n\n<p>If he does not, then you will have at least laid the groundwork for a complaint to your supervisor that your time is being wasted with \"Computer Science 131.\"</p>\n",
            " <p>My advice, to be blunt: suck it up.  If you like the job and the only problem is that a senior member of staff politely offers you guidance that you don't actually need, you should seriously consider that there is no such thing as a perfect job, and if it isn't this annoyance at the next job, it will be something else.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry to say it but you <em>are</em> still quite young and haven't even been there 6 months.  It will take time to prove your skill and knowledge and value to this team.  If you quit now you'll be the new guy on some other team, and you'll have to prove yourself to them.  </p>\n\n<p>So, get a thicker skin and don't let the fact that this guy doesn't think you know what you're doing bother you.  Answer <strong>politely</strong> with phrases like, \"thanks, I did know that\" or \"yes, I learned that a couple of years ago when working on X\" etc. and resolve not to let it bother you.  You can't control his actions, you can only control your own reactions. Don't get offended.  Just observe to yourself \"hmm, Larry still doesn't think I know how to do X -- that's silly since he knows I did Y at my prior company, which I couldn't have accomplished without knowing X.  Oh well, I guess he just wants to be sure.\"  And then stop thinking about it, don't obsess over it, don't try to get him to stop, don't try to barge in and finish his sentences.  Just let it go.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a mutual boss, you might also go to him/her and say something like \"Larry insists on continually giving me programming pointers that I don't need, and at this point I'm starting to find it a little insulting.  Is there any chance you could encourage him to lay off a bit?\"  If there isn't someone obvious to have this conversation with, revert back to \"suck it up\" and manage your reaction. </p>\n",
            " <p>Reverse it, and start teaching him how to do his job at the most fundamental level. Randomly explain to him what a method is.  When any opportunity arises, explain to him why you'd declare a variable as an int instead of a String. Explain to him the order of operations. Have a heart to heart to him as to why it's good to declare constants instead of having numbers throughout your code. Each time he offers you basic, unsolicited advice make sure you give him 2 ridiculous suggestions that same day. Within a week he'll stop.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: There was some element of hyperbole in there, but I've dealt with the type of people the OP has talked about. He has tried to discuss this head on, and that hasn't worked.We tried the same thing. He would talk down to us truly in our best interests he thought, and he meant well, but no matter what we said he would keep doing it.Finally as a joke someone said let's do the same thing to him, and for a week or 2 everyone would explain to him how to use for loops, the differences between MySQL engines, etc.He got the point and then some. He never fully stopped but for sure it decreased </p>\n",
            " <p>As a Senior / Lead Developer with a management degree here's the best way I've found and tested many times to deal with this sort of situation - assuming the person you're dealing with isn't just being evil.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Walk up to this guy and say \"Do you have fifteen minutes we could chat about something?\".</li>\n<li>Find an area out of the general flow of people (conference room is best if those are available) - Never give this sort of feedback in a public area; he'll get defensive and it won't have the intended effect of curbing the behavior.</li>\n<li>Use this formula: \"Lately it feels like you've been doing a lot of X.  When you do X it does Y.\"  </li>\n<li>In your case its; \"Lately it feels like you've been trying to help me out with a bunch of fundamental things I already know.  When you tell me things I already know, it makes me feel as though you don't value the experience that I do have which makes it harder to improve based on your feedback\".</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Bam.  This generally works for most level headed reasonably not-evil people.  If he is actually being a jerk about it; its time to raise that concern with your manager.</p>\n\n<p>He also may genuinely think you are at that level; which actually talking to him like this may help to change.  A lot of times its hard for seniors or leads to gauge where a developer is at; unless they have personally spent a fair amount of time with the person (or interviewed them for this purpose).</p>\n",
            " <p>The guy is possibly insecure, probably alot less paid than you and frustrated. His behaviour may be genuine but it definitely makes him feel senior to you, especially if someone overhears him 'coaching' you. I've been (and in many ways still am) in a similar situation. I just grinned and beared it for a while but that didn't work. Then I spoke to him about it. That worked for a week. The tipping point came when he actually complained about me as I was ignoring him more and more ( ' I'm too busy etc' ). Fortunately at that moment I'd gathered enough qudos on successful projects with the manager that the guy got shot down and put in his place after the next meeting. At which point I rather condescendingly put the boot in suggesting to my manager that perhaps his lack of professional behaviour was because he is frustrated about his job (which I genuinely believe). He is now known as someone who exhibits unprofessional behaviour and lost alot of respect. I defended his work recently to my manager and he thanked me for it. Which possibly even confirmed my 'seniority' over him, I don't know time will tell. But I also discovered that he has a very good reason to be frustrated, which means I've far more patience with him.</p>\n\n<p>There is no easier way to handle your situation as everyone is different. At the end of the day you've just got to be as professional and polite as possible. That doesn't mean you have to listen, especially if you are busy.</p>\n\n<p>Actually I just thought, maybe its even one of his objectives to 'coach' you!!\nIn that case maybe there is something else you can learn from him and ask him to redirect his 'coaching' to that instead. </p>\n",
            " <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Ask advanced questions.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I know how you feel as I, too, don't like it very much when someone tries to teach me something I <em>believe</em> I can teach others. I'm a dev, too.</p>\n\n<p>Let me sum up my perspective here:</p>\n\n<p>You say you are a dev. Being a dev means one and only one thing for sure: <em>there's always plenty to learn regardless of how much you already know</em>. </p>\n\n<p>You say that your <em>colleague</em> is a senior dev and you aren't yet you are on the same level in the team.</p>\n\n<p>Your colleague doesn't mean it to insult you when he gives you unsolicited advice. You think he means well.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, he is a senior in the company and that should mean that he knows things worth learning - you <em>too</em> want to be a senior dev some day, preferably some day soon. </p>\n\n<p>So, here's what I would do if I were you:</p>\n\n<p>Count to ten and in meantime try to control my anger and hurt feelings. </p>\n\n<p>and finally <strong>ask advanced questions</strong> once your coworker is done with the basics.</p>\n\n<p>My short and simple experiences as a dev tell me that <strong>nothing can gain you respect faster and easier than asking <em>good</em> questions</strong>. If you don't have questions, find a hole in your expertise you want to patch - I'm sure there's more than one. Then start asking.</p>\n\n<p>This will have some positive side-effects: you can get on good terms with your colleague very quickly. The willingness to help out will be used for good, and you'll learn new stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Or you'll come to discover that the basic level of advice is all your coworker is capable of and he'll bother you no more when he's failed to answer two or three well aimed questions of yours.</p>\n",
            " <p>There seems to be a bit of a case of narcissistic injury here. I understand why it might be frustrating to be have someone explain the basics to you when at your level you will have a firm grasp of them. You shouldn't let this turn into irritation towards the person trying to help you however. You do not know everything at this point so you are going to get advice and tips from time to time, a lot of them will be things you already know.</p>\n\n<p>I think the problem with this individual is he doesn't believe you're a professional. I'm sure there is some blame on his end, judging you by your age or not taking the time to learn your experience, but it may be you need to present yourself more professionally as you mentioned. </p>\n\n<p>Should he bring up a basic topic, respond with \"Yes, I've actually worked on this before in a similar situation X years ago.. have you thought about this approach?\" and give an example of your experience (without interrupting him). This will help show the person that you know your stuff and whether they continue to offer simple advice or not it will improve your relationship with them.</p>\n\n<p>It might be they're just the type who likes to offer a lot of advice and doesn't expect people to take offense. You may just have to get used to it and if that doesn't seem like an option you're just going to have to air it out with them, politely ask them to hold back on the advice as you see it as a distraction or unnecessary, being direct without being offensive and avoiding any passive-aggressive or petty responses.</p>\n\n<p>HTH</p>\n",
            " <p>You are describing what could be a paradigm shift: In his mind he may just be trying to be helpful, and he is unaware that he is making you feel talked down to. He may also just have the bad habit of being condescending to less senior people to try to assert his dominance. </p>\n\n<p>He should be paying more attention to your reaction and body langue and see if he is offending you. The fellow may not have highly developed social skills. You might want to try asking someone else what they think of him and they may confirm he is just condescending. </p>\n\n<p>Some people don't like to be given unsolicited advice. Giving poor or unsophisticated unsolicited advice is then adding injury to insult.</p>\n\n<p>This simplest thing to do is to politely and kindly tell him when he talks to you that way, you feel talked down to, and you don't like it. If you become hostile or aggressive during this conversation you may further strain your relationship. When you talk to him watch his face closely. Is he getting mad or frustrated or does he look concerned or apologetic?</p>\n\n<p>If he responds with anything but an apology then he has poor social skills, is trying to exert some lame dominance over you, or he is just condescending.</p>\n\n<p>Really it just sounds like he has poor social skills and is not up to speed on the principles and benefits of engagement. Proceed gently because he is in fact handicapped.</p>\n",

Those things you think are simple and basic - I guarantee there's some 30% of programmers out there that don't believe/agree with them. He may simply be showing agile team leadership by continuing to restate core values. This provides an opportunity for you and the rest of the team to either reinforce (\"Yes, we should always write unit tests\") or open for discussion (\"Well, but actually there is such a thing as too many unit tests\"). </p>\n\n<p>As you are new, he may be making sure to run through all the various existing shared team values to see if you're all on the same page and you are misinterpreting that badly. It definitely sounds like you are younger and value the independence part of the job more than the team part of the job. You should carefully reevaluate his statements through this lens, because from the agile engineering team manager point of view, \"great programmer who doesn't work well with his team\" is \"someone we regret more having to let go.\"</p>\n\n<p>Obviously just having a direct discussion with him about \"hey you keep telling me basic things and it makes me feel like you think I'm a dope, what's up with that\" will bring his real motivations out - I am not sure why you didn't do this within a week of this starting to bug you, and it reinforces my thoughts that something like the above dynamic is really in play here.</p>\n"

If you like the job and the only problem is that a senior member of staff politely offers you guidance that you don't actually need, you should seriously consider that there is no such thing as a perfect job, and if it isn't this annoyance at the next job, it will be something else.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry to say it but you <em>are</em> still quite young and haven't even been there 6 months.  It will take time to prove your skill and knowledge and value to this team.  If you quit now you'll be the new guy on some other team, and you'll have to prove yourself to them.  </p>\n\n<p>So, get a thicker skin and don't let the fact that this guy doesn't think you know what you're doing bother you.  Answer <strong>politely</strong> with phrases like, \"thanks, I did know that\" or \"yes, I learned that a couple of years ago when working on X\" etc. and resolve not to let it bother you.  You can't control his actions, you can only control your own reactions. Don't get offended.  Just observe to yourself \"hmm, Larry still doesn't think I know how to do X -- that's silly since he knows I did Y at my prior company, which I couldn't have accomplished without knowing X.  Oh well, I guess he just wants to be sure.\"  And then stop thinking about it, don't obsess over it, don't try to get him to stop, don't try to barge in and finish his sentences.  Just let it go.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a mutual boss, you might also go to him/her and say something like \"Larry insists on continually giving me programming pointers that I don't need, and at this point I'm starting to find it a little insulting.  Is there any chance you could encourage him to lay off a bit?\"  If there isn't someone obvious to have this conversation with, revert back to \"suck it up\" and manage your reaction. </p>\n",
        "rejected_target": " <p>Reverse it, and start teaching him how to do his job at the most fundamental level. Randomly explain to him what a method is.  When any opportunity arises, explain to him why you'd declare a variable as an int instead of a String. Explain to him the order of operations. Have a heart to heart to him as to why it's good to declare constants instead of having numbers throughout your code. Each time he offers you basic, unsolicited advice make sure you give him 2 ridiculous suggestions that same day. Within a week he'll stop.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: There was some element of hyperbole in there, but I've dealt with the type of people the OP has talked about. He has tried to discuss this head on, and that hasn't worked.We tried the same thing. He would talk down to us truly in our best interests he thought, and he meant well, but no matter what we said he would keep doing it.Finally as a joke someone said let's do the same thing to him, and for a week or 2 everyone would explain to him how to use for loops, the differences between MySQL engines, etc.He got the point and then some. He never fully stopped but for sure it decreased </p>\n"

While the temporary position is only until mid May.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if the start date is too late, they might not be interested in me anymore.</p>\n\n<p>If anything goes wrong I'm very tempted to resign, but again the problem is that I would be still stuck in this role for the three months of notice. The relationship is definitely compromised.</p>\n\n<p>I am looking for suggestions on how to proceed in this situation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To Consider:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>My manager does not gain anything from me moving to the temp role;</li>\n<li>I'd like to stay with this company because every few months there are good positions available in other departments. Not too secondary for me, good company perks.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\nAssistant:": {

    "\n\nHuman: <p>I have been working in an organization for 1 year and few months. After graduation it is my first job. After 1 year they gave me really good increment and recognized me as one of their really good employees. But I am facing an issue there and I'm not sure what to do about it.</p>\n\n<p>Issue:</p>\n\n<p>My team leader does not provide me any negative feedback or constructive criticism. If something is his opinion is not right then he does not point out that thing to me but directly informs about that to his senior, who is project manager.</p>\n\n<p>I am worried that because of this the project manager would be thinking that team lead talks to me but I do not listen to him. Once I was called by project manager and CEO to talk about my interest in the work, and I had no idea what caused those meetings. Apparently team lead had told them that I'm not interested...And project manager also asked me how are my terms with the team lead i.e. is he helpful to me...</p>\n\n<p>It was few months after this that I got a good increment. And obviously that was good feedback of team lead that contributed in that increment.</p>\n\n<p>After those meetings with manager and CEO, I really wanted to ask team lead about this that what am I doing wrong. But I did not, and recently something has happened again that instead of first talking to me, he approached project manager.</p>\n\n<p>I really want to ask team lead about this. And since he prefers to involve manager too, so I wanna talk about it to him too. But I am a straight forward person, I do not know any politics. And I do not have much professional experience. So, I'm afraid that if I'll ask them then things can get complicated for me.</p>\n\n<p>I'll also mention that I'm not a very talkative person. And usually some people think that it is difficult to talk to me because I'm very reserved. But it should not stop a team lead from talking to his subordinate...</p>\n\n<p>How can I encourage my Team Lead to give me the negative feedback directly before escalating management? Should I simply ask team lead to provide me negative feedback? Will it be wise to write it in an email and 'CC' to project manager too?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
        "responses": [
            " <p>The best thing to do would be to have a chat with your team lead. And yes, your talk to your team lead <em>should not include anything about the team lead telling your higher management about you not being interested</em>. Your question should be about your personal development where you ask him/her what you can do to improve your skills. </p>\n\n<p>The best way to prevent these kind of issues in future <em>is to make sure that your lead is comfortable talking to you about your faults</em> (or what he/she presumes are your faults). The expectation that your lead will tell you about your performance might not work out always. Hence, get him/her comfortable by initiating the communication from your side in a positive way. Take it as an opportunity to improve your skills by getting feedback from your lead. This is an interpersonal skill that will serve you well in the future.</p>\n\n<p>PS: As an afterthought, just asking someone to provide negative feedback might not work. I have been asked the same by some teammates and I find it difficult to put up with these requests. Also, shooting out an email with the manager in CC is a nice way to blow up your relations with your lead.</p>\n",
            " <p>In some companies, your team lead provides only technical leadership, such as choosing an architecture, deciding what will be in the next release, and so on. They are not your manager and are not supposed to give you a performance review.</p>\n\n<p>In these companies, the people who do give you performance reviews know that the team leads are closely connected to you (and your peers) and they can ask them \"how is user1204089 doing? How is the skill level, how is the interest level?\" Depending on what they hear from the team leader, they may talk to you and ask you how it's going or what they can do for you. This is <strong>very different</strong> from the team leader approaching them and saying \"hey, user1204089 is just not interested in the work.\" It's even possible that after observing you and talking to you they have already concluded that your team leader isn't very good about providing information about you.</p>\n\n<p>It's important that you know who in the company is assessing and reviewing you. If it's the team leader, you can take steps to make sure that the team leader tells you <strong>as well as</strong> (not instead of, this sounds like you want to get away with bad performance) the higher-ups. If it's one of the higher-ups, you can mention to this person that you'd like more frequent feedback about how you're doing, and even ask whether the team leader is a good person to go to for that feedback.</p>\n\n<p>In other companies the team lead manages you, and is responsible for making you better. Some managers, who aren't good at their jobs, try to set up other people as \"fall guys\" by whispering bad things about them. If you have such a lead, my condolences. But the good news is that your higher-ups don't appear to be fooled. They are giving you salary increases and praise. Work as directly and openly with this lead as you can. For example, you could email the team lead, cc-ing a higher-up, saying \"Ms Higher-Up mentioned today that you are worried I am not interested in learning that new database tool. I'm so sorry you got that impression. I would love to learn it. When can we meet to talk about specific steps and timing?\"</p>\n\n<p>The most important thing to do is to keep doing a good job, and to have the confidence that you are doing so. The next most important thing is open communication with everyone around you. When the higher-ups bring you in for a discussion, see it as a good thing. Hear as much as you can and make sure they know where you stand and how you feel as well. Don't get into secretive or sneaky conversations behind anyone's back. </p>\n",

It could well be that your boss agrees with her, feels there's an implied hierarchy in place that he wants to keep, and in that case the only real solution is to request a 1 to 1 with your boss and explain the situation is making you unhappy (though again, avoid pointing fingers at your coworker and stick to the practicalities when explaining what's wrong.)</p>\n\n<p>If neither of the above approaches work then, short of just putting up with it, your only real solution could be to look for employment elsewhere.</p>\n",

    "\n\nHuman: <p>Two years ago, my boss handed me my first annual salary adjustment letter. It was a substantial increase, retroactive to the beginning of the year.</p>\n\n<p>I filed it away. I noticed a pay bump, but because I also adjusted my 401k and insurance around that time, it wasn't obvious that I wasn't getting the full amount described on the adjustment letter.</p>\n\n<p>Doing my taxes the next year, I noticed my gross income didn't seem to match what I remembered that letter saying. I looked at my paychecks online and found that I was actually being paid <em>$5k less</em> than that amount. Unfortunately, I'd misplaced that letter, and started to suspect that I had just misread it. And it was still a decent increase, after all.</p>\n\n<p>My next annual salary adjustment hailed a \"raise\" of $2k (i.e., less than I originally thought I was making the year before). But again, I couldn't say for sure without last year's letter, and I was embarrassed to think I'd misread that sort of pay increase.</p>\n\n<p>After filing this year's salary adjustment letter, however, I found my original letter from 2017. It really does have that higher salary figure in black and white, and confirmed that number by saying it was \"an increase of $XX,XXX.\" I hadn't misread it after all.</p>\n\n<p>I brought all three salary adjustment letters to HR today and asked what happened. It turns out my manager asked for special permission to give me the larger-than-usual raise. In an email to HR, the CEO approved the smaller raise I actually got, but somehow that change never made it to the letter my manager ultimately signed and handed to me a couple weeks later.</p>\n\n<p>On the surface, it looks like an honest mistake on HR's part. And I should have been more diligent in following up when I noticed the problem, especially now that it's two years (and two salary adjustment letters) past.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Should I mention anything to my manager?</strong> Or just let it go?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:": {
