Being a naive undergraduate, I knocked on proffessor's doors, asking for a supervisor, and one of them, very generously agreed. He suggested a problem I thought was interesting and so I started the research. I originally started throwing analysis at the problem, and started trying to solve some really complex differential equations (which kept me motivated). However I did not make much progress, so after my supervisor marked that I needed to get something, I fully changed my approach and started using some geometric approximations to solve the issue. This generated some results, but was too simple. I'd like to say that my results were inversely proportional to how much effort I was putting in the research.</p>\n\n<p>Time passed, I had multiple potential solutions and a way to evaluate them. On the last week before the final submission I realised there was a bug in my code base that was destroying the results (they were mathematically impossible). I tried to find the error, but the best I could do was identify an area where a mistake could have happened. </p>\n\n<p>Finally I got my evaluation on the course after presenting it. The feedback said the methods were a bit naive and could be improved on, and it was dissapointing that I didn't get numerical results (I had visual results, not numerical), however since I was not a seasoned researcher they decided to be lenient and gave me an A anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I applied to the grad program at my university, and asked the same proffessor to be my supervisor for the grad program. I am in desperate need of financial support until the grad program starts, and so my supervisor said I could do summer research for him and in the meanwhile we could discuss what the grad project could be. What he wants me to do is finish my previous work and get a publication. </p>\n\n<p>The issue is that I legitimately feel that dinking bleach would be more motivating (I am using this metaphor to convey just how much anxiety this is giving me). This research really does not appeal to me in any way or form, and the interesting part is over, all that is missing is finding the bug, which could take more than two weeks to solve and implementing a couple of modifications to make my naive methods less naive if things go well, or complete failure to finish it in the worst case.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to that I have been doing independent research simultaneously as I have been taking courses and doing everything else. Although this independent research still needs a lot of work, it's in a good place, I have already improved many of the papers I have read and have multiple ideas to explore. In an ideal world I would win the lottery tomorrow and I could just support myself while I carry on with this research.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure how to approach my supervisor and tell him I don't want to finish this research, nor how to suggest to do my research instead and get a publication out of that, or even if I should touch on this topic at all.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

If the costs (time invested) of a project outweigh the benefits (results and publication strength), your supervisor may want to abandon the project. It is important to find out how long you still need, and only then (if still applicable - maybe it's a two-week bug fix that doesn't feel like drinking bleach) have a discussion with your supervisor.

The staff member apparently gave her a \"funny look\", which confirmed the postdoc's view that this staff member is abusing their position of privilege. Anyone who points out that this is a total non sequitur is accused of allowing bullying to flourish. </p>\n\n<p>This situation has been building steadily over the last few years and now five or six postdocs keep a running tally of \"microaggressions\" so microscopic that it is very difficult to see how they can exist. For example, one postdoc sits with their back to a door, and a professor came in to talk to another colleague, and didn't acknowledge them. This incident was talked about for weeks as evidence of the professor's \"rudeness\". In other cases, some people are labelled \"creeps\".</p>\n\n<p>To be clear: I absolutely do not condone abuse. I know power dynamics are real, and that many minorities (of which I belong to several) experience daily microaggressions and othering. I have been on the receiving end of workplace bullying myself, and would never wish to silence real problems. I too am a postdoc, so have no additional power and gain nothing from allowing abuse to flourish.</p>\n\n<p>What worries me is that none of these incidents are being raised with any of the staff members in question. Therefore, many junior researchers have accepted as fact that their professors are horrible and selfish people. I'm concerned about this mindset, because in at least three cases, these \"selfish\" professors have some form of autism (I know this as I'm a wellness officer). Perfectly ordinary behaviour is framed as malicious.</p>\n\n<p>Personally I've found it very upsetting. Many of the people on the receiving end of this gossip are very kind, if not socially awkward, people. It scares me that so many people uncritically accept that everyone with a permanent job is some kind of bogeyman; of course, I cannot betray confidentiality by informing my colleagues that many of these incidents didn't occur and indeed it's kind of ableist to assume you can read minds all the time. Abuse and power struggles certainly can, and often do, occur... but if any of these complaints were substantial they should be raised with HR. </p>\n\n<p>The sad truth is that I think my colleagues just get their power from trash talking others, and aren't actually interested in the truth. Dissenting voices get shunned (and accused of being privileged / not being woke). Anyone who isn't in 100% agreement gets immediately shut down. But, also, my colleagues are just upsetting themselves for no reason. They're scared of encountering these \"terrifying\" professors, most of who have done nothing worse than dressing slightly shabbily and being uncomfortable with eye contact. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone have any advice on dealing with this kind of situation?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

Such problems tend to disappear when there is more interaction because people are more likely to attribute a bad interaction to 'must be having a bad day' rather than 'must be a bad person' when they know the person. Would it be possible to encourage more interaction within your department? For example, you could suggest a work-in-progress monthly session where PhD students and postdocs once a year or so talk about their work. If you have 4 people from different groups presenting, then more senior people will turn up as one of 'their' students/researchers will be presenting.</p>\n"

Unless their Bachelor/Masters program specificaly teaches how to work in academia, they will have absolutely no idea. At our university only psychology students actually understand the scientific method, and only molecular medicine/biochem students are prepared to work in their respective fields. The rest learns facts and math. What I mean by that specifically is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They do not know how a paper is structured and why it is done the way it is in your field. What belongs in the introduction? What belongs in the discussion? Andy why? Etc. Take a good paper, and go through it. Then take a couple of bad ones (maybe student submissions), and make them point out mistakes to them.</li>\n<li>How do you find a research idea? (Relevant only after the first project)</li>\n<li>How do you actually research a question? Some might never have used google scholar, and do not even know that you can look up &quot;cited by&quot;. Why should you always try searching for a review? How do you stay up to date in a field? What are the top journals/people to pay attention to?</li>\n<li>What tools are there? They might be obvious to you, but they are not to them. Google Scholar, Connected Papers, Zotero with all Plugins, etc. Whatever you use, show them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, to start them off, give them a clear project, with a clear goal. They have no idea what is relevant in the field, and neither should they.

My prof wanted to see an almost polished version of everything, which meant that I wasted so much time ...</p>\n<p>Once they wrote the first paper, they probably should be able to come up with original ideas and be very productive, and you will not need to guide them, but will be instead working as peers.</p>\n<p>Make sure they are not afraid to come to you with ideas. If they have a very stupid one, explain why it is not feasible, instead of dismissing it. Never use your taste/experience as a reason to dismiss something without a good explanation. If they are afraid to come to you with ideas, they will not be having fun, and you will not be happy, trust me. This also goes for teaching.

You can be reasonably assured that someone - and probably many people - will look at each line item in a submitted budget, so they will need to be sensible, clearly defined, and obviously necessary or highly desirable for ensuring the success of the project.

The forces you are trying to fight are so much bigger and more powerful than you, that unless you are willing to dedicate your entire life to fighting them, knowing that you will achieve either nothing or very little, your only other choice would be to keep your head down, either ignore or join in the cheating, and resign yourself to a life of dissatisfaction and unfulfilled dreams.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry it's pessimistic and depressing, but there it is.

I also have an iPhone and I myself notice that it does not heat up if I am out in the open, but it heats up and drains the battery if I am in the basement of a large concrete building.</p>\n<h2>2. Case?</h2>\n<p>If you have a case for your iPhone, you should expect that it heats up. The case, while it does protect your phone, also blocks some air from coming out and consequently causes the hot air to be trapped inside the phone. This will cause your iPhone to heat up almost indefinitely.</p>\n<p><strong>Possible Solution</strong></p>\n<p>When you are charging your iPhone, take it out of its case. While this may be inconvenient, it will help.</p>\n<h2>3. CPU Usage</h2>\n<p>If your phone is heating up, you may have a lot of applications open. Also, if you were playing a lot of games, then you can expect an increase in CPU usage and temperature as well.</p>\n<p>All of the listed items below can contribute to an increase in CPU Usage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Games</li>\n<li>Data Usage (Facebook, Emails)</li>\n<li>Fetch/Push Data</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Possible Solutions</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Do a <code>Network Connections Reset</code> (Go to Settings =&gt; General =&gt; Reset =&gt; Reset Network Settings, then reboot (you will lose WiFi passwords)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Try disabling the following apps (in Settings =&gt; General =&gt; Restrictions): Multiplayer Games, Ping, App Store, iTunes Store. Then reboot.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>4. Defect</h2>\n<p>If nothing else works, then it is also quite possible that your iPhone is defective and if this continues to occur as you have stated, I would take it to an Apple Store.

You may want to add an entry in <code>fstab</code> with the added parameters <code>noauto</code> to prevent the OS from remounting the drive.</p>\n<p>I use <code>rdisk-disk2.vmdk</code> for the name, because this virtual machine is just a pointer to this device. After reboot, the situation could change e.g. a device might be assigned a different number especially if you unplug things and move things around.</p>\n<h1>Start Virtual Box Manager with Root Privileges</h1>\n<p><code>sudo /Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/MacOS/VirtualBox</code></p>\n<p>Because devices are all owned by root, you need to start VirtualBox with root privileges. This has consequences. Your home context (home folder and preferences) will be changed to root. Your other virtual machines will not be visible. If you open a file browser, you will see the root's home folder by default.</p>\n<p>Another option is to change the permissions of the device (not recommended) as you have done.</p>\n<p>To confirm permissions of devices, you can run <code>ls -l /dev/disk*</code></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add New Machine, provide name: /dev/disk2, type: linux, version: arch linux (64-bit)</li>\n<li>Give it some memory (whatever you can)</li>\n<li>Select existing drive using VMDK created above.

If using <code>grub-mkconfig</code>, the name of the efi file is grubx64.efi (assuming 64 bits). VirtualBox is finicky about where it looks for a boot file. The default will not do.</p>\n<p>Rename <code>grubx64.efi</code> to <code>bootx64.efi</code></p>\n<p><code>/boot/EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi</code></p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Notes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>tip: get yourself iterm 2</li>\n<li>This is super useful for Macbooks when installing Arch Linux, because the default ISO does not load the wlan card drivers.</li>\n</ul>\n"

It removes everything in a given directory and the directory itself, so if you give it path <code>$HOME/directory_1/directory_2/</code> the <code>directory_2</code>  will be gone along with its files. The rest of the path will be safe. Heres' an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ tree somethings/                                     \nsomethings/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 subdirectory_1\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 a\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 b\n\n1 directory, 2 files\n$ rm -rf somethings/subdirectory_1/                    \n\n$ tree somethings\nsomethings\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So as far as your commands go:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>rm -r \"$HOME/.wine\"</code> only removed <code>.wine</code> directory</li>\n<li><code>rm  $HOME/.config/menus/applications-merged/wine*</code> only took care of all files starting with <code>wine</code> string in <code>$HOME/.config/menus/applications-merged</code> folder</li>\n<li><code>rm -r \"$HOME/.local/share/applications/wine\"</code> removed the <code>wine</code> folder only</li>\n<li><code>rm $HOME/.local/share/desktop-directories/wine*</code> got rid of the files starting with <code>wine</code> in  <code>$HOME/.local/share/desktop-directories</code> folder</li>\n<li><code>rm $HOME/.local/share/icons/????_*.xpm</code> nuked all <code>.xpm</code> files.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In other words they're sufficiently safe.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>What me and Rinzwind have discussed in the comments and Ask Ubuntu chatroom, is that it's possible to alter <code>$HOME</code> variable. Yes, it is possible, but if you intentionally alter <code>$HOME</code> , you need to keep that in mind; otherwise, it's not <code>rm</code>'s fault and let's be honest - it's plain stupid from user's point of view. Commands work only on the path you give it, so give the commands proper path.</p>\n\n<p>Other potential issues is spaces. If you have space in your home folder name, like <code>/home/My User</code>, then without quotes around <code>$HOME</code> the shell will think you're giving it two arguments, <code>/home/My</code> and <code>User</code>. This effect is known as word splitting. So always quote your variables like <code>\"$HOME\"</code></p>\n"

For me it hanged scanning dm devices which it seemed to do in decreasing order by number, this led me to suspect an external USB drive. The drive had opened LUKS on it but was not mounted. Previously having it attached had been fine. Closing it with cryptsetup also hanged so I disconnected it physically. After that running mdadm scans worked fine and updating initramfs also worked.</p>\n<p>If you have this problem and need mdadm try running <code>sudo /sbin/mdadm -vv --examine --scan --config=partitions</code> and see if that hangs (the extra -vv is for more verbosity). If it does, check <code>ls -l /dev/mapper/</code> if that points you to a drive that might be causing trouble.

For example you will need it for disks that are larger than 2 TiB.  But not all operating systems recognize it (especially older OS, like Windows XP, but linux distros from a couple of years ago too), and teh same is true for soem utilities, so using MS-DOS partitioning is better if you don't know beforehand what computers you need to connect to, or what applications you are going to use.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, when you need to exchange data with Windows or Mac OS X users sometimes, it's probably best to use NTFS or even FAT32.  Personally I solve this by having multiple partitions on my portable disk.  That way I can use the FAT32 partition for when I need to exchange files, and the ext3/4 partition for \"personal usage\".  If you only use them as storage for Ubuntu systems, I'd suggest you use a linux filesystem (e.g. ext3/4) because it will be faster &amp; more stable.</p>\n"

(Note that the noun forms of these adjectives won't work: <em>goodness</em> has a very wide range of meanings; <em>virtue</em> refers to qualities inhering in a person and carries no connotation of action unlike <em>virtuous act</em> which does, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>As you're writing for an Indian audience, the word you have in mind that's already familiar to your audience (<em>pun&#803;ya</em>) is a perfectly good choice to use.

In a non-religious framework for ethics, of course, there is no such thing as sin either; though certain acts may still be called <em>unethical</em> or <em>wrong</em> or by other terms.</p>\n\n<p>I'm no expert on Christian theology, but it seems that according to that framework, one is born in a state of some sin, and although one can commit further sins (acts against God's commandments), one cannot automatically reduce the effect of those sins simply by performing other good acts. Judaism has a concept of <em>mitzvah</em>, an act that carries out a commandment of God, which may be an opposite of <em>sin</em> in that sense. The concept you may be getting at, prominent in Indian religions (Hindu/Buddhist/Jain/Sikh) comes from a different model, in which there's something like a moral bank balance (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma\"><em>karma</em></a>) in which you can either lose credit through sin (<em>p\u0101pa</em>, acts against some cosmic order of right and wrong) or gain credit/merit through good deeds (<em>pun&#803;ya</em>).</p>\n\n<p>All that is not important, but if by the opposite of <em>sin</em> you're referring to something like the latter concept as informally understood by your audience\u2014with a slight theological connotation as something that brings merit to the doer\u2014then the term <em>pun&#803;ya</em> you were thinking of is precisely the right term to use. Using a generic phrase like \"good deed\" may not convey the intended meaning unless the context is understood (such as in translations etc., where \"good deed\" and \"meritorious act\" are indeed used).</p>\n"

                "content": "\n\nHuman: <p>In a documentary film on the Russian Revolution the narrator used the phrase \"within a generation\", and I'm not exactly sure what it means.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Socialism promised peace, prosperity, and equality for all peoples of the world. But the social experiment failed. Millions were killed, and <strong><em>within a generation</em></strong> almost one third of the world's population was living in the shadow of communism.<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wanted to check a few figures about how many people lived under communism, but the phrase \"within a generation\" left me wondering at what period I should be checking populations figures. Generally I've had the habit of considering roughly 20 years for a generation. In some dictionaries and other sources it says a generation for humans is about 30 years. It also mentions this on Wikipedia.<br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>generation<br>\n  2.the term of years, about 30 among human beings, accepted as the average period between the birth of parents and the birth of their offspring.<br>\n  <a href=\"https://www.thefreedictionary.com/generation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Random House Kernerman Webster's College Dictionary</a> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Anyway, in terms of that particular use of \"generation\", couldn't \"within a generation\" mean something closer to a person's average lifetime, say, 50, 60 or 70 years? The reason I'm wondering this is because, for example, say a group of people are born in 1960. Couldn't you say the 9/11 terrorist attack occurred within those people's generation? Even if they were 41 years old at the time it happened, and also notwithstanding that by that time another younger generation had been born? </p>\n\n<p>Is that a reasonable use of \"within someone's generation\"?</p>\n\n<p>Even if we take 30 years to mean a generation, the narrator's statement would mean that by about 1947 nearly a third of the world's population lived under communism. This just doesn't seem right. In 1947 the world's population was about 2.5 billion. One third of that is about 830 million. But we can't even include China (roughly with a population of 500 million), because it didn't become communist until 1949. Similarly the British Empire and/or India (it doesn't matter because independent India was never communist anyway) had a population of over 500 million, and when you consider the other most populous countries that were never communist this figure of \"almost one third\" really doesn't sound right. That is, of course, unless \"within a generation\" can be understood to mean what I mentioned earlier, roughly a group of people's lifetime, meaning it can extend to 40, 50, or 60 years. In that case I can imagine China's population explosion, along with other communist revolutions just maybe might bring it to the \"nearly one third\" measure used in the film. </p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

If there was any intent of being precise, they'd have used the actual numbers - instead of a generation, they'd have said 32 years, from 1917 to 1949.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that there is indeed a difference between \"a generation\" and \"a lifetime\". </p>\n\n<p>A generation is used to express the average time between the birth of a population mass and the birth of this population's offspring, so that's about 20-30 years. You often see this when you see articles about the cultural differences between the so-called \"baby boomers\", \"generation X\", \"Millenials\" and \"generation Z\", which are 4 populational groups separated by roughly 20-30 years in age. Another application of the common meaning of \"generation\" is when you're talking about ancestry when you have migratory movements - e.g. \"I'm a second-generation Japanese\" when referring to having Japanese ancestry when not being born in Japan.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, \"a lifetime\" is a person or a population's lifespan, and it can span multiple generations, since people now live enough to have grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</p>\n"

The fog of all lust had been swept away leaving nothing but this dreadful lucidity. Oh, she had changed! Her complexion was now that of any vulgar untidy highschool girl who applies shared cosmetics with grubby fingers to an unwashed face and does not mind what soiled texture, what pustulate epidermis comes in contact with her skin. Its smooth tender bloom had been so lovely in former days, so bright with tears, when I used to roll, in play, her tousled head on my knee. A coarse flush had now replaced that innocent fluorescence. What was locally known as a <strong>\"rabbit cold</strong>\" had painted with flaming pink the edges of her contemptuous nostrils. As in terror I lowered my gaze, it mechanically slid along the underside of her tensely stretched bare thigh\u2014how polished and muscular her legs had grown! </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The way it's dashingly described, the condition is instantly recognizable in the sentence (let's give the author that, he is an artist, not just a linguist). </p>\n\n<p>But. Is there a more common term for it?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NiAHZ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NiAHZ.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong></p>\n\n<p>\"Locally known\" would mean New England, or, to be more precise, Massachusetts, where the novel's \"Beardsley School for Girls\" is located, according to some reputable sources, including, but not limited to, the fellow who authored <em>The Annotated Lolita</em> (a volume that includes the novel's text and an index and comments whose length exceeds that of the novel).</p>\n\n<p>A bright gal published an essay on the web in which she claimed she had definitely gone to the school that is described in the novel. The essay includes this photo:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/W8hY2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/W8hY2.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In the French translation of the novel the \"rabbit cold\" is referred to as \"<em>le rhume des lapins</em>\" (courtesy of @Graffito): word-for-word, and just as puzzling as the original. The Russian translation of the same novel (penned by Nabokov himself) has it as \"\u043a\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u044c\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0430\", which, I'm told, is the exact same thing, and a quick google search on it turns up the exact same useless slew of references to sick rabbits and various methods of treating them as the original. </p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

If you dropped down to 700 SR, chances are you probably belong somewhere around that level, plus or minus a couple hundred SR. (Not trying to be rude, just stating how the system is supposed to work.) It might be tough, but if your actual skill level is higher than that, you should eventually climb out on your own. Buying a new account risks you paying extra money just to go through the exact same frustration when you drop lower again. </p>\n\n<p>At the start of every new season, there is a soft-reset of all player's ranks (normalized to the average player rank, which I think is somewhere in silver or gold). I don't know if this also affects MMR, but it should give you a chance to place higher than you might have gotten in the previous season. </p>\n\n<p>Loss streaks happen, and the matchmaking system realizes this. Chances are your MMR is probably not all that heavily affected. You're probably still playing with people of a similar skill level as before, but because your visible rank is lower, you focus more on how \"bad\" your teammates are <em>now</em> as opposed to how they played before the loss streak. </p>\n\n<p>Even if your MMR is lower now... that's how it's supposed to work.

Let's look at Gangplank for example. Gangplank is generally considered a pretty squishy champion unless he builds health and armor/magic resist. He is one of those champions that people build as a glass cannon sometimes, someone who does a lot of damage but dies easily. However lets look at his base stat. He starts out with 495 + 81/level. That's a starting health of 576 plus any health that his starting item might have given him. That's quite a lot for someone who is considered a relatively squishy champion.</p>\n\n<p>Now lets look at a champion that is normally considered tanky. Lets look at Udyr. Udyr's health is 427 + 99/level so he starts with 526. That is 50 less health! But Udyr has much higher health gained per level than Gangplank does. This means Gangplank has a stronger earlier game(in terms of health). You can take this thought process and apply it to the armor and magic resist  and other statistics.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Skills and Passives optimized for level 1</strong></p>\n\n<p>This should be a philosophy that should apply to late game too but it is especially important early game because each of your teammates will only have on skill available to them instead of all 4. Choose a team that is balanced. You need a good balance of crowd control plus damage. A team that focuses too much on damage but has no crowd control will not be able to focus down on a single target enough to kill them. With the use of a snare or a stun, it provides a definite bull eyes sign for all your teammates to focus, usually screwing up their team formation and it will also prevent the enemy from getting away from the damage by preventing them from flashing away and making them become easier targets for skillshots.</p>\n\n<p>Damage:</p>\n\n<p>Generally casters are a lot weaker at level 1 because they are limited to one skill and their base attack damage and attack speed are very low! This will lower the amount of damage they can deal. </p>\n\n<p>When choosing a strong early game damage dealer, take a look at their base attack damage and their skills. A champion like Ganglank, has a strong early game because he has multiple sources of damage. His auto attacks can proc his passive that can not only deal additional damage but provide a slow, AND his Parrrley which has a relatively low cooldown can add a lot of additional damage.</p>\n\n<p>Crowd Control:</p>\n\n<p>Generally a team that is able to stop a enemy from running away or actually brings the enemy to the team will have the upper hand in team fights. Morgana's Dark Binding starts out with a 2 second snare. That is quite a bit of time to stand still. Blitz who takes his grab at level 1 will literally serve one of the enemies on a platter if one of them is pulled into your team.</p>\n\n<p>Passives:</p>\n\n<p>Not only do we have to look at the skills a champions have but also their passives. Some champions passives will be way more useful in level 1 fights than others. For example, Volibears passive will let him regenerate 30% of his health back when he reaches a certain threshold on his health bar. Or Anivia who turns into an egg when her health bar reaches 0. Contrast that to Ryze who gets a 1 second cool down reduction for each spell he casts. But that reduction can't be utilized at all since he can only use one skill at a time. Or Ahri who gains life steal for one attack after hitting 9 targets. This is great in all for sustain but during the course of a team fight, the passive will not really play a big factor.</p>\n\n<p>Non-target skillshots:</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes in a level 1 fight, you get to an impasse where neither teams are willing to iniate and are just standing just out of range. Having a champion with a long non-target skillshot harass will generally mean an easier team fight OR allow you to push them back if you are indeed trying to invade their jungle. These skills include Nidalee's spears, Lux's Lucent Singularity(which not only damages but also provide vision for 5 seconds if she does not detonate), and Ezreal's Mystic shot. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Vision</strong></p>\n\n<p>If there is a support on your team, ask them to take Clairvoyance and to buy wards(technically, you shouldn't need to ask them if they are playing support). Vision is very important especially in early games because a champion can be focus down very fast if you can see them. If you are invading their blue, or if your blue is being invade, throw a ward onto the bush right next to where the golem spawns. Once the team fight starts, the support should throw the Clairvoyance right behind where the enemy is so provide vision of all of them. Vision in the jungle is very limited because, the bushes and the corners in the jungle will inhibit vision.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Initiation and Team Formation</strong></p>\n\n<p>Because in level 1 fights the tanks have not begun building tanky items yet, there really isn't a tank per se. Anyone who runs into the fray can easily be focused down in seconds. Because of this, it is better to stay in formation (champions with higher defensive base stats in the front, and champions with lower defensive base stats in the back), and play reactively. If one of them charges in, then focus that champion down. Generally it is smart to have your \"formation\" near a bush so the squishy targets can utilize that to avoid being a initial target in the fight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Items</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since Champions start out with 475 gold or 515 gold(if you put the two points in the ultility tree), items do not play as big of a factor. However generally buying Dorian items will give you more bang for your limited buck and give you an early game advantage.</p>\n"

Where rigorous results are folkloristically employed to achieve some result which, actually, would need much more care in deriving it... But presumably, mathematical details would not change the physical picture. Here the difference between <em>theoretical physics</em> and <em>mathematical physics</em> evidently shows up.   </p>\n\n<p>Actually, that uniqueness theorem is not properly used in the example you mention. As it stands in your initial statement, the uniqueness property holds when $\\Omega$ is an open and <strong>bounded</strong> subset of $\\mathbb R^n$ and $\\varphi$ is continuous in $\\overline{\\Omega}= \\Omega \\cup \\partial \\Omega$ and it is $C^2(\\Omega)$ satisfying Poisson's equation $\\Delta \\varphi = \\rho$ in $\\Omega$ itself. </p>\n\n<p>(The proof of uniqueness is a trivial consequence of a celebrated theorem on harmonic functions $\\phi$ in $\\Omega$, i.e., functions verifying $\\Delta \\phi =0$ in $\\Omega$, which are  continuous in $\\overline{\\Omega}$. That theorem  establishes that, if $\\Omega$ is open and it closure is compact, $\\max_{\\overline{\\Omega}} |\\phi|$ is reached in a point of $\\partial \\Omega$. Thinking of $\\phi$ as the difference of two solutions of Poisson's equation filling the same boundary conditions, the uniqueness property easily arises.)</p>\n\n<p>When $\\Omega$ is <strong>not</strong> bounded, as in the mentioned example, where $\\Omega = \\{(x,y,z) \\in {\\mathbb R}^3\\:|\\: z&gt;0\\}$, one must add further requirements on the behaviour  of $\\varphi$ for $||(x,y, z)|| \\to +\\infty$, and there are a number of possibilities.</p>\n\n<p>However the mentioned example suffers for another problem. In the above mentioned uniqueness result, $\\rho$ is continuous because $\\Delta \\varphi$ is.\nIn the considered example instead $\\rho$ is singular, properly speaking is a Dirac delta. There are several possibilities to deal with this problem. \nThe simplest one is replacing the point charge with a given spherically symmetric distribution - with total charge $q$ and confined in a bounded spherical small region - and continuously vanishing at the boundary of that region. In the rest of my answer I assume it.\nAnother possibility, technically more complicated is to remove the point occupied by the charge from $\\Omega$. In this case the uniqueness result cannot be exploited as it stands because $\\Omega$ acquires another part of boundary, where the potential diverges. Other approaches based on Green's identities instead of the maximum principle could be implemented in that case.  </p>\n\n<p>In this case in $\\Omega$ the charge is $q$ (that is the $\\rho$ distribution you mention) with distance $d$ from $\\partial \\Omega$ and $\\varphi=0$ on $\\partial \\Omega$ because $\\partial \\Omega$ is a grounded conducting plane. The value of $\\varphi$ on $\\partial \\Omega$ is constant, we are free to assume that it is $0$. <em>The true boundary condition here is that $\\varphi$ attains on $\\partial \\Omega$ the same value it attains for   $||(x,y, z)|| \\to +\\infty$.</em></p>\n\n<p>Let us pass to consider the situation where two charges stay at the reciprocal distance $2d$ along the $z$ axis, focussing on what happens in $\\overline{\\Omega}$ (not outside it) regarding charge distributions and boundary conditions of $\\varphi$. </p>\n\n<p>The $\\rho$ distribution  in the half space $\\Omega = \\{(x,y,z) \\in {\\mathbb R}^3\\:|\\: z&gt;0\\}$ is the same as in the previous case: There is the charge $q$ at distance $d$ from the plane at $z=0$.</p>\n\n<p>Also the boundary conditions of $\\varphi$ on $\\partial \\Omega$ and for  $||(x,y, z)|| \\to +\\infty$ are the same as for the other case: The plane at $z=0$ is equipotential in view of the symmetry of the problem and the value of $\\varphi$ thereon is the same as the value of $\\varphi$ for  $||(x,y, z)|| \\to +\\infty$. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, applying the uniqueness property in $\\overline{\\Omega}$, we are committed to conclude that  the potential $\\varphi$ in the region $\\Omega \\cup \\partial \\Omega$ is the same in both cases.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ADDENDUM</strong>. Actually one can use an argument arising from the theory of elliptic regularity to deal with uniqueness in situations where in a bounded region are present point charges described by Dirac deltas. The idea relies upon the following elliptic  regularity result. </p>\n\n<p><em>If $\\phi$ is a distribution verifying $\\Delta \\phi =f$ (in weak sense)  for a smooth ($C^\\infty$) function $f$, then $\\phi$ is a $C^\\infty$ function up to zero measure set.</em></p>\n\n<p>(It is worth stressing the the above result immediately entails the fantastic fact that harmonic functions are always $C^\\infty$ and not only $C^2$, actually it is possible to prove that they are <em>real analytic</em>.)\nThis result leads to the following uniqueness theorem which can be improved making weaker some hypotheses on the behaviour of the function on the \"regular\" boundary.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theorem</strong>. <em>Suppose $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb R^n$ is non-empty   open and $\\overline{\\Omega}$ is compact. Let $p \\in \\Omega$ and consider  the problem:</em>\n$$\\Delta \\varphi(x) =\\rho \\quad x \\in \\Omega \\setminus \\{p\\}$$\n<em>with boundary conditions</em>\n$$\\varphi|_{\\partial \\Omega} = f$$\n<em>where</em> \n$$\\varphi \\in C^2(\\Omega \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\cap C^0(\\partial \\Omega \\cup  \\Omega \\setminus \\{p\\} )$$ <em>and $f \\in C^0(\\partial \\Omega)$ and $\\rho \\in C^0(\\Omega \\setminus \\{p\\})$ are assigned.</em>\n<em>If both $\\varphi_1$ and $\\varphi_2$ are solutions of the problem and</em> $$ \\lim_{x\\to p} (\\varphi_1(x)-  \\varphi_2(x))=0\\:,$$ \n<em>(where the limits can diverge or not exist, if considered separately in order to embody the case of a point charge at $q$) then</em>\n $$\\varphi_1 = \\varphi_2\\:.$$</p>\n\n<p><em>PROOF</em>. With the given hypotheses, evidently $\\phi:= \\varphi_1-\\varphi_2$ is continuous on $\\Omega$, therefore it is a distribution for test functions, $h\\in C_0^\\infty (\\Omega)$. If $B_\\epsilon$ is a small ball around $p$ with radius $\\epsilon$, using continuity of $\\phi$ in particular, integrating by parts and defining $\\Omega_\\epsilon := \\Omega \\setminus B_\\epsilon$, we have\n$$\\int_\\Omega \\phi \\Delta h d^nx = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+}\\int_{\\Omega_\\epsilon} \\phi \\Delta h d^nx =\n\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\int_{\\Omega_\\epsilon} (\\Delta \\phi) h d^nx = \n\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\int_{\\Omega_\\epsilon}(\\rho-\\rho) h d^nx$$ $$= \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+}  0 = 0\\:.$$\nAll that means that $\\phi$ is a distribution solving $\\Delta \\phi =0$ in distributional sense. Therefore, in view of the mentioned elliptic regularity property, it is a smooth function up to a zero measure set. Since $\\phi$ is continuous on $\\Omega \\setminus \\{p\\}$ and extends to a continuous function at $p$ (which has zero measure), $\\phi = \\varphi_1-\\varphi_2$ is a smooth function everywhere in $\\Omega$. In particular, by continuity of second derivatives the smoothly extended function $\\phi$ verifies $\\Delta \\phi =0$ in the whole set $\\Omega$ in the <em>proper sense</em>. By construction, we end up with a function $\\phi$ which is $C^\\infty(\\Omega) \\cup C^0(\\overline{\\Omega})$, satisfying $\\Delta \\phi =0$ in $\\Omega$ and $\\phi =0$ on $\\partial \\Omega$. In view of the standard uniqueness result, $\\phi=0$ in $\\overline{\\Omega}$, i.e. $\\varphi_1= \\varphi_2$ in   $\\overline{\\Omega}$. QED</p>\n"

My question is in regards to the part where we utilize the fact that the Hamiltonian conserves the total spin to block-diagonalize it. In this explanation it says that \"block-diagonalization just amounts to including states with only given $m_z$,\" and the process is to simply compute individual blocks with different total magnetization. </p>\n\n<p>My question is, how is this different than simply rearranging the order of the states?

It seems to me that if I reorder the states such that all those with the same $m_z$ are adjacent then the resulting matrix should be block diagonal.</p>\n\n<p>I have written a code to swap rows and columns of the Hamiltonian such that they are ordered from maximum $m_z$ to minimum $m_z$, but the resulting matrix is not block diagonal.

Work is defined as the change in energy of an object, and can be calculated as the net force times the distance over which the force is applied. If the object does not move, that distance is zero, so zero work is done on the object.</p>\n<p>The biomechanics of the human body make it so that you do get tired from holding a heavy weight, so a biological system typically does consume energy holding an object in place. But this is because muscle fibers are constantly relaxing and contracting by very small amounts, even when attempting to hold an object still. When you hold a weight, you are constantly doing small, nearly imperceptible amounts of work which will eventually tire you out.</p>\n<p>A table, on the other hand, does not consume any energy or perform any work at all to hold an object in place. A weight can sit on a table forever, and the table does not require any source of energy to keep the weight in place. What the table does provide is a normal force which exactly balances the force of gravity, meaning the weight experiences zero net force and does not move, which indicates that zero work is being done.</p>\n<p>The key difference here is that the table relies entirely on intermolecular forces to hold the book in place. This is what gives rise to the normal force, which occurs &quot;automatically&quot; when two surfaces come in contact. Your arm, on the other hand, relies on muscle power to hold a book in place. If you relax your muscle, your arm will fall, because your muscles do not naturally &quot;lock in&quot; to place - constant tiny adjustments are needed to keep a muscle in place. You could pile books on a dead body and they would be held up by the normal force from intermolecular interactions just like a table does, but to hold them up by muscle power requires some input energy to hold them in place.</p>\n<p>As an interesting biological counterexample, we can look at the three-toed sloth's grip. The connective tissue of their claws is structured such that the natural grip position is closed, and requires energy to open. Because of this, sloths can hang from branches <em>even after they're dead</em>, clearly requiring no energy and performing no work to maintain their position.</p>\n"

This guy is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serge_Haroche\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Serge Haroche</a>, and he earned a Nobel prize for his work. What he did was to design a cavity that can capture and hold a single (or a few) photons. Then he sends highly excited atoms through the cavity and afterward makes measurements on those atoms. The way these atoms evolve while passing through the cavity depends on whether the cavity contains a photon or not. This way he could detect the existence of photons in the cavity.</p>\n\n<p>Also, what Haroche showed is that a single photon does have an electric field and a magnetic field (contrary to what <strong>anna v</strong> says in her answer), because the reason why the excited atom evolves as it does when it passes through the cavity is because of the effect that the electromagnetic field of the photon in the cavity has on the atom.</p>\n\n<p>This is still very different from measuring the effects of a passing photon though. However, we can say a few things about a photon. Firstly, it is not like a little ball of light propagating in the beam of light.

This is the principle behind various kinds of radiation therapy: you irradiate a tumor from multiple directions; the treatment volume is exposed to the sum of all the radiation while the surrounding tissue gets only a fraction of the exposure (since the treatment beam only passed through the region for part of the time). Furthermore, by fractionating the treatment (maybe 1/30th of the total radiation needed in a single treatment session, and some time between sessions for the surrounding tissue to \u201crepair\u201d) the effect can be more localized.</p>\n\n<p>These things suggest two things: gamma rays deposit their energy over larger areas (lower dose per unit volume) and below a certain threshold the body is capable of repairing itself (note - for radiation protection purposes the latter point is often ignored: in that field, 0.001 mSv / hour for 1000 hours is considered to be as harmful as 1 mSv/hr for one hour. Radiation treatment protocols suggest that is not quite true).</p>\n\n<p>Contrast this to a beta particle (an electron). The stopping distance in tissue is extremely short, so it will do very local damage. All the ionization will be confined to just a few cells - the ability to correct the errors introduced is limited. By the above argument that would be problematic.</p>\n\n<p>Of course a single particle is not likely to hurt the body. But if you aimed a narrow beam of N particles (gamma or beta) all with energy E at one part of the body (say, a spot on the hand), then the local ionization damage of the beta (deposited energy per unit volume) would be greater.</p>\n\n<p>This is the principle behind certain cancer treatment protocols where microspheres or targeted molecules labeled with (for example) Lu-177 or Y-90 are deliberately implanted into a tumor: the beta radiation from the particles kills cells in the immediate vicinity without affecting tissue further afield (although the Bremsstrahlung of the decelerating electrons creates some secondary Xrays which do throw the energy to a larger region; they also allow visualization of the treatment with, for example, a gamma camera so the physician can ensure that the target volume is actually reached as intended).</p>\n\n<p>This is a complex answer - bottom line is that a narrow beam of beta particles of a certain energy will deposit this energy in a smaller region, and because of the nonlinear effect of ionizing radiation on the body, this produces more significant local damage.</p>\n\n<p>But one could write entire books on the subject to cover all the cases, exceptions, provisos. I hope the above is a useful start.</p>\n"

With a significantly larger atmosphere, the rays would not be able to pass through Jupiter, or even penetrate very far through the most upper regions of it. Furthermore, having a rocky planet-part (as is believed most gas-giants have) at the core, the gamma rays would have an even more difficult time penetrating through that.\nIn theory, high enough energy gamma rays <em>could</em> penetrate through to the other side of Jupiter; however, we do not possess the capability of creating rays with that much energy.</p>\n\n<p>In short, yes we can use gamma rays for science, but not to make tomographic maps of planets.</p>\n"

Indeed, if you apply equal and opposite forces to opposite ends of a rod, even though summing them would give you zero, you will create a torque that will rotate the rigid body around its centre of mass.

Instead that  phase is a label for some combination of real force to take on the role of causing the inward acceleration that must be present for curving motion to occur. What combination of forces varies from problem to problem and even from time to time in a single situation. What that combination <em>is</em> is something that you have to discover in each problem. </p>\n\n<p>But you do have one hint. The simple kinematics of the motion tell you what the magnitude of acceleration must be.</p>\n\n<p>In this case $F_c = |\\text{gravity times mass}| - |\\text{normal reaction force}|$. This is a specific case of the general rule that centripetal force is the sum of the inward pointing forces (or components of forces) minus the sum of the outward pointing ones.<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n<p>Secondly, you need to know that a bathroom scale measures the normal force between the person and the ground. This gives us a different understanding of \"weight\" than $mg$ (and it is one that works right when we say a astronaut in orbit is \"weightless\").</p>\n\n<p>So, \n$$\\text{weight} = \\text{normal reaction force} = mg - m\\frac{v^2}{r}\\,,$$\nis the expected reading on the scale at the equator.<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To expand a little on the \"why\" of this approach, I want to start by talking about equilibrium.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have identified that some object is in equilibrium then you know something about the forces acting on it in aggregate: they add up to zero. That doesn't tell you about any single <em>a priori</em>, but if you know all the other force (or know that there is only one force) then it lets you finish.</p>\n\n<p>The \"centripetal force\" is very much like that: because the object is in curving motion you know that it is <em>not</em> in equilibrium but accelerating, and furthermore you know that the component of its acceleration that points to the (instantaneous) center of curvature is $a_c v^2/r = r\\omega^2$.</p>\n\n<p>And <em>that</em> tells you that the total of all the radial forces acting on it must be $ma_c$ (and again, this is something you know about a collection of forces). But before you can use this knowledge to your advantage you must identify which forces (or components thereof) should be combined before being set to that total. </p>\n\n<p>So an early step in working problems that involve \"centripetal force\" is asking <em>\"Which of these force point toward the center and which point toward the outside?\"</em> The former enter into the sum with a positive sign and the later with a negative sign.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> You should note that because these are the only forces acting on the person at the equator and they <em>do not</em> cancel out because that person is <strong><em>not</em></strong> in equilibrium. But you knew that: they are moving in a circle, right?</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> Except that we have forgotten to account for the Earth's non-spherical mass distribution. But that is another story.</p>\n"

Since planetary systems originate from a rotating disk of matter, and since binary stars may also originate that way, the possibility of ending up with two stars and one or more planets all orbiting in a common plane seems intuitively plausible, and some candidates have been reported. The paper [1] says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Following the first detection of a circumbinary planet with the Kepler space telescope, namely Kepler-16b, eight more binary star systems with a planet on a P-type orbit have been discovered. All these systems show striking similarities. They are all very flat, meaning that the binary and the planet orbit are in the same plane, suggesting that these planets formed in a circumbinary disc aligned with the orbital plane of the central binary. Furthermore, in all systems, the innermost planet (so far only Kepler-47 is known to have more than one planet) is close to the calculated stability limit...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another theoretical analysis of instabilities in the orbits of circumbinary planets is presented in [2], whcih says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Consider a planar three-body system of gravitating bodies: a central massive binary and a much less massive particle orbiting around the binary. Thus,\n  the particle\u2019s orbit is circumbinary. ... the circumbinary orbits cannot be permanently circular. This phenomenon provides a natural universal mechanism of internal tidal friction and heating in circumbinary planets (CBP)... In this article, we describe and consider the planetary escape process that takes place as a result of this shrinkage. Indeed, a particle in the slowly shrinking circumbinary orbit enters eventually the chaotic zone around the central binary, and therefore escapes. Once in the zone, the particle escapes inevitably... We show that the effect of tidal decay may explain, at least partially, the observed lack of CBP of close-enough (with periods &lt;<span class=\"math-container\">$ 5$</span> days) stellar binaries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A recent search for circumbinary planets is reported in [3], which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We present the full survey results of the Search for Planets Orbiting Two Stars (SPOTS) survey, which is the first direct imaging survey targeting CBPs. The SPOTS observational program comprises 62 tight binaries that are young and nearby, and thus suitable for direct imaging studies... Results from SPOTS include the resolved circumbinary disk around AK Sco, the discovery of a low-mass stellar companion in a triple packed system, the relative astrometry of up to 9 resolved binaries, and possible indications of non-background planetary-mass candidates around HIP 77911. We did not find any CBP within 300 AU...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>An older report [4] says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ranked near the top of the long list of exciting discoveries made with NASA's Kepler photometer is the detection of transiting circumbinary planets. In just over a year the number of such planets went from zero to seven, including a multi-planet system with one of the planets in the habitable zone (Kepler-47).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some other recent references are cited in the the introduction of [5], which says this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One of the exotic type of planetary systems detected by the Kepler mission are transiting circumbinary planets (CBPs), i.e., planets in nearly-coplanar orbits around a stellar binary (and nearly coplanar with the plane of the sky), temporarily blocking the binary\u2019s light and giving a generally complex light curve [references]. Currently, 10 confirmed Kepler CBPs are known in 9 binary systems (see Table 1 for an overview [with references]). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p>[1] \"Migration of planets in circumbinary discs,\" <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00314\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00314</a></p>\n\n<p>[2] \"Tidal decay of circumbinary planetary systems,\" <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02090\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02090</a></p>\n\n<p>[3] \"SPOTS: The Search for Planets Orbiting Two Stars.

(More precisely: in every infinitesimally small volume element.) Each charge element experiences the force as determined by the vector field value at the point. The force on the object is the vector sum of all those contributions. </p>\n\n<p>It is possible to find one point that has the property that the translational motion of the object acts as if the total charge on the object is concentrated at that point.  One might call it \"center of charge\", but as you point out, one does not often hear of such a thing.  That is, take that charge at that point (which turns out to be the <em>total charge</em>), and multiply by the value of the electric field vector at that point, and you will obtain the force on the object as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that there might be one point that can be considered to be \"where the force acts\" is a consequence of summing, is not fundamental and has some limitations. In a sense it's an illusion. It works only if you can afford to model your object as a point particle. For example, you can't use it to calculate torque.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine that your object is a cube that is uniformly positively charged on its \"left\" half, and is uniformly positively charged on its \"right\" half, and has total charge zero.   In a uniform electric field there will be no force on the object.  The \"center of charge\" will have $q=0$.  The same result obtains by summing the forces on all the charge elements in the cube.</p>\n\n<p>However, the cube will spin!  There will be a torque on the cube.</p>\n\n<p>Now, you may not care that it spins.  If all you care about is the trajectory of the object, all you care about is the force.  In such a case, you can afford to model the object as a point, and the \"center of charge\" approach will give you what you want.  But if you care about rotation, you cannot afford to model the object as a  point, and you cannot use the point particle model.

I'm taking this jump for granted since as I understand it, it was arrived at from experimental results on electromagnetism at the end of the 19th century.</p>\n\n<p>Now in line with Gauss, it seems like it would be extremely natural to speculate about replacing the flat metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$ by one with non-vanishing curvature (and in the same spirit also considering more exotic topologies for the underlying manifold).</p>\n\n<p>Given that then we would have to ask exactly which metric we are looking for, it seems natural to say that there should be a Lagrangian term corresponding to the metric. The Einstein-Hilbert functional is probably the simplest one to try. And so we get the Einstein equations.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively (as I heard from someone is the actual history) you could observe that the energy-momentum tensor is of course a 2-tensor, and so for an Euler-Lagrange equation the most natural metric-dependent expression would be $\\operatorname{Ric}=T$. Since $T$ is always divergence free it would be natural to replace $\\operatorname{Ric}$ by $\\operatorname{Ric}-\\frac{1}{2}Rg$ just from taking the contracted second Bianchi identity into account. And so again we get the Einstein equations.</p>\n\n<p>I've often heard it said that if Einstein had not come up with special relativity, someone else probably would have in the next five or ten years. However if he had not come up with general relativity, it would have taken much longer to discover. <b>Why is this?</b> I feel that I must be missing something here.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

Then we can ask ourselves how to include gravity without violating causality, which is mandatory by the finite velocity of light.</p>\n\n<p>The idea is to consider Einstein's elevator. Namely that there is no local experiment which can be done that can differentiate between bodies in free fall in a constant gravitational field and the same bodies uniformly accelerated. That's because gravity affects everything the same way. A somewhat formalization of this is called Einstein's equivalence principle (in contrast with Galileo's, that say about coordinate transformation by constant velocities).</p>\n\n<p>Note first that this is not the case for eletromagnetism. One can always use test charges to determine the electromagnetic fields, and it is impossible to do away with them using accelerated frames. Also, the equivalence principles is strictly local. If you look at extend regions gravity will appear through tidal forces.</p>\n\n<p>So, if you think that special relativity is a particular case of general relativity (because it's just the same without gravity) the question is: what looks locally like special relativity but not globally? The answer is curved lorentzian manifolds, that locally are Minkowski.</p>\n\n<p>But, as Jerry stressed, if you think in curved manifolds as generalization of flat ones, that does not, in principle, say anything about gravity. Only by noticing it is a force unlike any other, and formalizing it through the equivalence principle, one can justify the physics behind it, that is the use of curved manifolds. For instance, you suggest it is natural to generalize the situation by allowing curved spaces, but from the mathematical point of view one could just as well argue that there are other forms of generalization, e.g. we could instead try to projectify Minkowski. This is indeed usefull in other contexts, but it has nothing to do with gravity. So for a physicist is important we have \"conceptual insights\" to guide the process of \"generalization for comprehension\", or in other words we need principles with physical content.</p>\n\n<p>I'm really unsure about what Gauss could be thinking regarding the metric. He did try to formulate classical mechanics in a differential geometrical way (Lanczos \"Vartiational principles of classical mechanics\" discusses it), but if that's what you're referring to, then it had nothing to do specifically with gravity.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Oh boy, that last sentence is very misleading, I'm sorry. I had a look at Lanczos' book and realized that while Gauss pushed for a different formulation of classical mechanics, it's called Principle of Least Constraint, page 106 in Lanczos, it was only after some time that Hertz gave the principle the geometrical interpretation. So really not relevant to you question. I won't erase the paragraph though, in case anyone is interested.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the equivalence principle argument says nothing about the field equations, and would be true even if the correct equations were different. As a matter of fact, a lot of general relativity independs of Einstein Field Equations, like the causal structure and (to some extend) the singularity theorems. This is why the equivalence principle was formulated as early as 1907 but the field equations came only in 1915.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not a big fan of \"what if\" questions in history, majorly because they don't seem to have answers, but while Poincar\u00e9 had the Lorentz trasnformations and a lot of understanding of special relativity, I never heard of anyone who anticipated the equivalence principle. So I hope this makes plausible that while  others could have done SR, it did not seem likely that GR was coming, because first it was needed to understand what gravity is. Nordstrom's theory is an extension of ideas of eletromagnetism and was bound to failure. Hilbert indeed got the field equations right on his own, but would not get there without the motivation of curved spacetimes</p>\n"

If you read a literature on the subject, you'll find a lot of beautiful results, I'll describe the basic idea below.</p>\n\n<p>The geometric quantization works with a phase space rather then configuration, i.e. you start with a symplectic manifold. It's actually a more general case because once you have the configuration manifold, the corresponding symplectic manifold is just its cotangent bundle with natural symplectic structure.</p>\n\n<p>You should fix extra geometric data -- a polarization. It's a half-rank integrable distribution, so locally on the phase space you have a foliation, which defines what direction corresponds to \"coordinates\" and what -- to momenta. For example in the usual \"p,q\" case you take half-rank distribution, i.e. half-rank subbundle of tangent bundle, generated by ${\\partial\\over\\partial p}$, so it generates \"momentum direction\" and the transverse direction corresponds to \"coordinates\".</p>\n\n<p>Then you build a prequantization line bundle, which is a hermitean line bundle with hermitean connection, such that its curvature is proportional to the symplectic form (the usual normalization ${i\\over 2\\pi}R = \\omega$, where $R$ -- curvature, $\\omega$ -- symplectic structure), so that symplectic form is just the first Chern class of this line bundle. You do not need polarization for this step. But you actually need the first Chern class of the bundle to be integer, which can be considered as a general case (which corresponds in the compact case to the condition that the phase space has integer volume in the units of $(2\\pi\\hbar)^{dim/2}$).</p>\n\n<p>Then you consider the space of sections of this bundle and take it's subspace, annihilated but the connection (covariant derivative), taken along the polarization. What obtained (or, more precisely, $L^2$-closure of square-integrable sections from the obtained subspace) is defined to be the Hilbert space of the problem. In the standard example, you take functions on the phase space, annihilated by ${\\partial\\over\\partial p}$, which are just functions $\\psi(q)$ depending on coordinates only, and then consider square-integrable functions of coordinates.</p>\n\n<p>Next for each (smooth) function on the manifold you build operators on that space. There are different existing prescriptions for that, I'll not cover it here.</p>\n\n<p>Should also note that there exists another version of geometric quantization -- Berezin-Toeplitz quantization -- where you don't need polarization in a sense described above. Instead you define the Hilbert space either as as a kernel of the $Spin^c$ Dirac operator, or as a kernel of the \"renormalized Bochner-Laplasian\" operator. This approach is pretty computable, especially in the case when the symplectic manifold is actually Kahler (in such case standard geometric quantization works well too, since there is a canonical holomorphic polarization).</p>\n\n<p>Also have to add, that since there is no global notion of coordinate in general case, there is no \"coordinate operator\", instead you build operators, corresponding to smooth functions on the manifold.</p>\n\n<p>And one more comment -- it is tentative to say, that path integral could provide such a coordinate-free description. But in fact path integral is not a well-defined notion by itself, there's no well-defined and invariant notion of integration over the infinite-dimensional space of paths in general. To define path integral you need to fix some additional data, you need to \"regularize\" it (discretize, mode-expand, whatever). In many cases that will include fixing coordinates as well. Also, in general case this regularization can break coordinate invariance of the phase space.</p>\n\n<p>Path integral can't be considered as an honest prescription. In general it's just a heuristic instrument used by physicists in cases, when they have no better tools to use. Though in some particular examples path integral can be justified.</p>\n"

Encryption, digital signature, decryption, and signature verification are all done at the <em>endpoints</em> by the <em>client software</em>.  The intervening e-mail servers and service providers have nothing to do with this, as the messages get passed along just like any other.  Further, and perhaps most importantly, S/MIME must be supported by both the <em>sending and receiving clients</em> in order to work.  This is beyond the ability of any single e-mail provider to ensure.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, I'm not aware of any common freemail provider (i.e.: GMail, Yahoo, Hotmail) that is currently facilitating S/MIME in their browser-based clients.  Certainly none of them are, nor would they want to be, enabling it as a default.</p>\n\n<p>The reason this cannot work at the service provider level is because of the requirement for both endpoint clients to support the protocol.  Since the service provider of the sender has no control over the client software used by the recipient, enforcing S/MIME use on outbound messages would result in many (if not most) recipients not being able to read the sender's e-mails.</p>\n\n<p>The only conditions under which S/MIME will work are when all participants in the e-mail conversation have S/MIME-compatible clients, and everyone has (and has verified) each others' public keys.  Again, this is not something that any individual e-mail service provider can effect.  They may conceivably be able to facilitate this between their own users, but they do not have the same power to protect e-mails going to/from external endpoints.</p>\n\n<p>SSL/TLS are technologies commonly used to secure communications between clients and servers and from server-to-server.  However, here we again run into a similar situation as with S/MIME - both parties to the conversation must support it.  While some service providers may do this, no service provider can guarantee you that SSL/TLS will be applied to every message you send because they do not have control over what the receiving server is configured to support.</p>\n\n<p>To address your concerns more concisely, point-by-point:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>None of the above use S/MIME.  While it would be a nice feature for them to support in their web clients, it would be infeasible for them to guarantee that it will work for all recipients.  You can get around this to some degree by using your own e-mail client with S/MIME support, instead of using the web interfaces.  However, again, this will only work where you have coordinated this with your intended recipients.</p></li>\n<li><p>SSL/TLS is commonly used to protect the web sessions by which e-mails are composed, and the client connections by which they are sent.  It's also used to protect server-to-server communications along the way, but no service provider can guarantee that every recipient's e-mail servers or client will support and maintain that protection along the way.</p></li>\n<li><p>Many providers do use SSL/TLS, but you should check with yours yourself if you're concerned.  Again, though, this cannot guarantee that your e-mail is protected through transmission and storage every step along the way to every recipient.</p></li>\n<li><p>Any time you are sending/receiving e-mail which is not protected by S/MIME, PGP, or a similar end-to-end encryption solution, you must assume that the message has been transmitted or stored in the clear, or in another form readable by a third-party, <em>somewhere</em>.  </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The last point touches on an issue I've not yet addressed - e-mail storage on the server.  All e-mail service providers, by the nature of their service, must store e-mails exactly as they were received or by using some form of encryption that they themselves can reverse.  Otherwise, they will not be able to forward the e-mail on in a readable format to others or display it to you in your web browser.  If you're not using end-to-end encryption, that means your e-mail is being effectively stored in the clear.  This leaves it vulnerable to malicious insiders, or anyone who manages to hack into your e-mail account or the server's database.</p>\n"

If it could be audited and enforced by the VPN (quarantine &amp; remediation) that'd be even better.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

Once you understand how it works, and you have the appropriate skill-set, you can defeat it quite easily. If it's your <em>own</em> malware and viruses, then it's really quite simple: you know exactly what <em>your</em> malware does, and how to defeat it, correct? After all, you programmed it.</p>\n\n<p>While yes, I agree in general with the use of a Virtual Machine, it isn't 100%. Nothing is 100%. You can infect your own machines, whether they're online or offline, and do interesting things with them. </p>\n\n<p>You can observe how the malware interacts with your environment through many different methods. Here are some notable examples:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Observing all changes to the file system, and/or hard drives.</li>\n<li>Observing memory</li>\n<li>Debuggers such as <code>OllyDbg</code>, or <code>IDA Pro</code>.</li>\n<li>Network packet-capturing tools such as <code>Wireshark</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Disable the Virtual Machine's internet connection for best results</strong></p>\n\n<p>While others talk about malware \"possibly escaping\" the <code>Virtual Machine</code>, it isn't very likely, though it is possible. Even if the malware could detect that it's running inside a virtual machine, that doesn't help much unless the malware <code>self-destructs</code> upon detecting a virtual environment.  </p>\n\n<p>Even if a VM isn't detected, a piece of malware could simply <em>try</em> to escape it by assuming it may be there. So methods to prevent the malware from detecting it's inside a VM may not work, unless it's the type that self-destructs when detecting it. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding the \"attacks\" you've mentioned, let's take a look at the results of them, assuming you can remove the infections:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Zip bomb</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A zip bomb, also known as a zip of death or decompression bomb, is a malicious archive file designed to crash or render useless the program or system reading it. It is often employed to disable antivirus software, in order to create an opening for more traditional viruses.</li>\n<li>After removing the infection, the left-behind zip-bomb can be nullified by deleting the files. If you made this yourself, simply make a cleanup routine. If you didn't make it yourself, simply make a cleanup routine. If the program is still forcibly running, you can reboot. </li>\n<li>Won't cause physical problems with your hardware.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Fork bomb</strong> \n\n<ul>\n<li>In computing, a fork bomb (also called rabbit virus or wabbit) is a denial-of-service attack wherein a process continually replicates itself to deplete available system resources, causing resource starvation and slowing or crashing the system.</li>\n<li>Won't cause physical problems with your hardware.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Folder blaster</strong>.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Same concept as the zip bomb, but with folder spam. Just write a routine to delete them. </li>\n<li>Won't cause physical problems with your hardware.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Better yet, if you have a <code>virtual testing environment</code>, you can delete these automatically by saving the state of a virtual machine before the infection, and restoring it after you're done studying the output. This is the easiest, most efficient method by far. </p>\n"

The <code>Set-Cookie</code> header will only be sent once, so if there are two browsers logged into the same session, one of them will be using the old, invalid session. You could have a small overlap where both sessions are valid to avoid problems with requests for resources that the browser has yet to request (e.g. an AJAX request that has just been sent awaiting a connection, while the server has responded with a new ID to the main page request). This gives a good balance of usability whilst fulfilling your single session requirement as the browser that does not receive the new cookie will be logged out.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to do this is to go for a stricter method, as employed by some banks. Rather than store the Session ID in a cookie, it is stored in the page itself. This also ensures that the user follows a set route through your site and cannot jump to pages out of sequence. The way this works is that there is a hidden field within the page and each navigation action is a HTTP POST to the next page. e.g. you could have a single handler at <code>https://www.example.com/loggedInAction</code> and each form POSTs to that:-</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;form method=\"post\" action=\"https://www.example.com/loggedInAction\"&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"requestId\" value=\"123456\" /&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"action\" value=\"navigateToMyAccountPage\" /&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The idea here is that the Request ID is regenerated after each navigation action, and the server uses this Request ID to keep track of each session. Session sharing is not possible as the ID is stored in the form rather than the cookie, although it can be combined with a cookie if you wish to keep session ID and the request ID separate. If another user did copy the request ID and edit their request, only the first user could continue as each Request ID is expired once used. This approach will also prevent use of the back button on the site, and it is really an approach that needs to be designed into the system from the start.</p>\n"

From the outside, the role of the password manager is to store the passwords and show them only to duly authenticated entities, so that the stored passwords may be used with third-party systems which are completely unaware of how the passwords are remembered by users.</p>\n\n<p><em>Encryption</em> is a mechanism which can be used to ensure data confidentiality within certain conditions. In the case of a password management database, the use or non-use of encryption makes a difference only with regards to partial breaches by attacker. Since RatticDB must be able to produce the stored passwords on demand by the right user, a complete hijack of the machine necessarily allows the attacker to obtain all passwords, regardless of encryption. However, if a backup file for the database component is stolen, then encryption matters: if the data was encrypted with a key that was <em>not</em> stolen, then the breach does not reveal the passwords.</p>\n\n<p>From an engineering point of view, RatticDB's stance is understandable: as an application-level piece of code, it may consider that database encryption is best dealt with at the database level, out of the scope of RatticDB itself. Indeed, whether encryption brings benefits or not depends on contextual characteristics such as the local backup policies. A comprehensive database encryption system would be <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparent_Data_Encryption\" rel=\"nofollow\">TDE</a> (as implemented by Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server), which is done on the database, regardless of the application.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Another model</strong> where encryption could be applied, and would become relevant, would be a password manager which stores only encrypted passwords that the manager <em>cannot decrypt</em>. In a way, this is how most \"password wallet\" applications work, when included in your browser (e.g. <a href=\"http://keepass.info/\" rel=\"nofollow\">KeePass</a>): data is ultimately encrypted with regards to some user secret (e.g. a \"master password\") and decrypted right on the user's machine, even if the encrypted passwords are physically stored in another machine. This sort of thing can work only if the client system (the one closest to the human user) is able to do decryption, something which is not a given in a Web context (basically, it needs a browser extension). RatticDB appears to follow another model, which supports dumb clients (Web browsers with no extension).</p>\n"

But this can be made more transparent to the user if the user explicitly trusts the DPI appliance.</p>\n\n<p>For the details to this see <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/133254/how-does-ssl-proxy-server-in-company-work\">How does SSL Proxy server in company work?</a>, <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/105683/deep-packet-inspection-ssl-how-dpi-appliances-prevent-certificates-warnings\">Deep Packet Inspection SSL : How DPI appliances prevent certificates warnings?</a> or <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/107542/is-it-common-practice-for-companies-to-mitm-https-traffic\">Is it common practice for companies to MITM HTTPS traffic?</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why can't the VPN provider just use a similar box to decrypt it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It actually could do this.</p>\n\n<p>Only, in theory users would need to explicitly trust the VPN provider for inspecting SSL traffic similar to what is done in companies. But, if you for example install the VPN software provided by the VPN provider, this software could actually silently trust the computer the VPN provider for SSL interception so that you don't realize that the provider can sniff and even modify the encrypted traffic. This silent installation of trusted certificate authorities is actually what many antivirus products do, so that they sniff encrypted traffic and protect the user from attacks delivered inside encrypted connections.</p>\n\n<p>One could in theory find out that the provider is doing this by looking at the certificate chain for each SSL connection and comparing it to the expected one. Or one can look at the locally trusted certificate authorities and see if there was one added. Still, if you install software from the VPN provider the provider could also change parts of your system like the browser in order to hide the inspection from you. And this is not restricted to software given by the VPN provider - any software you install could actually make such changes.</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/119364/how-can-i-detect-https-inspection\">How can I detect HTTPS inspection?</a>.</p>\n"

                "content": " <p>There are two parts to your concern about password length, the threat model and the rationale behind longer passwords.  As you state,  a lot of websites have protections against common attacks, and if the password database hasn't been leaked, your password isn't easily guessable, and online protections against brute-force protections are in place, longer passwords don't make much of a difference.  When those assumptions fail, long passwords can make sure your password is too expensive to crack, as demonstrated in research.  The more general case of this question, \"Why have strong passwords at all?\", is covered in <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/52031/why-does-password-strength-matter/52039\">this question.</a></p>\n\n<h2>Threat Model</h2>\n\n<p>The threat most password policies are concerned with is an attacker trying to crack the hash of the password which has been stolen or leaked from the system, also known as an offline attack.  This usually has some of the strictest requirements. However, these offline attacks aren't the only threat model.  You password could be compromised in other ways, like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Brute-force on the website itself, as you mentioned:  Most secure websites have protections against this, which are further discussed below. Long passwords do help you from online brute-force attacks, although the cost/attempt is much higher than an offline password cracker.  These kind of attacks are somewhat common.</li>\n<li>You reused a password and the password was compromised elsewhere:  The only prevention here is to not reuse passwords. Password length won't help here and too stringent of password requirements might even discourage users from setting a different password for each site.</li>\n<li>A friend, colleague, or social engineer is trying to guess your password based on their knowledge of you: While password length helps here, you don't need very long passwords to stop this attack, and often services are rate limited to only a few attempts per hour per computer.</li>\n<li>There are also methods like phishing, exploiting the password reset, and stealing a plaintext database. In all of those threats it doesn't matter how complicated your password is; it's gone anyways.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Focusing just on online attacks and limiting log-in attempts is bad practice because password database leaks do happen.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkj3n7/myspace-data-breach-427-million-passwords-available-online\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MySpace</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/07/adobe-password-leak-can-check\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Adobe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/31/dropbox-hack-passwords-68m-data-breach\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dropbox</a>, and others have all had password hashes stolen. You can check if you appear on any public leaks <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Don't Websites Block Online Brute-Force Attempts?</h2>\n\n<p>A major part of your question appears to be why password requirements are such a big deal if protections against brute-force attacks are in place.  PCI compliance, for example, requires account lock-out for at least 30 minutes after 6 failed attempts. The biggest problem in preventing these attacks is working against botnets with thousands of computers without causing a denial of service.  How do you prevent thousands of computers each trying to log in a few times without also locking out the user when they mistype their password while using a new computer, or using the same proxy as the botnet?</p>\n\n<p>There are other ways other than lockouts to <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/42271/how-can-you-i-detect-low-frequency-brute-forcing-over-multiple-connections\">rate-limit attackers, like asking for CAPTCHA</a>. However, there are <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448963/has-recaptcha-been-cracked-hacked-ocrd-defeated-broken/549859#549859\">some ways to work around CAPTCHA</a>.  This <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blocking_Brute_Force_Attacks\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OWASP page</a> discusses more of the best ways to block brute-force attacks.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Longer Passwords Help</h2>\n\n<p>A few decades ago when Unix was king, it was considered that five-character passwords <a href=\"https://spqr.eecs.umich.edu/courses/cs660sp11/papers/10.1.1.128.1635.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">were pretty good</a>.  Now the stakes are higher, advanced hardware is cheap, and hashes can be broken faster than ever so the requirements for good passwords are higher.  This is part of the reason more companies are pushing for longer passwords.</p>\n\n<p>Longer passwords help because the difficulty of password cracking goes up exponentially with password complexity.  <strong>Just adding one random word to your password can make it thousands of times more expensive to guess</strong>- the difference between seconds and hours of cracking time.  Adding another random word turns those hours into years.</p>\n\n<p>Many people advocate for using symbols and creating passwords from larger and larger character sets to make passwords more difficult to crack.  However, <a href=\"http://www.guanotronic.com/~serge/papers/chi11b.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">several</a> <a href=\"http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2012/papers/4681a523.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">examples</a> in <a href=\"http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2012/papers/4681a523.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">research</a> show that requiring longer passwords instead of very complex passwords leads to harder-to-crack passwords (and is more user friendly).  The longer passwords side was also famously supported by xkcd's <a href=\"https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/936:_Password_Strength\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"correct horse\" method to generate passwords</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One caveat is that longer passwords aren't always more secure since extra characters can make a password more predictable.  \"orrect horse battery staple\" is more secure than \"correct horse battery staple\", although the latter is much more memorable.  Good password meters like <a href=\"https://telepathwords.research.microsoft.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Telepathwords</a> or zxcvbn take this into account and will warn you when the extra characters are predictable.</p>\n\n<h2>How Long Should Passwords Be?</h2>\n\n<p>The specifics of how long your password has to be, and how hard it is to crack, can't be answered without knowing how your password is generated, how the password is hashed on the server, and the attacker's resources. For <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/144/how-long-should-the-password-be\">more details see this question</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I'll warn you, that password policy is a matter of opinion.  I've tried to show the best solution based on research, but there are some experts who disagree with me.</p>\n"

You can generate the server's keypair and start deploying it to clients immediately.</p>\n<p><strong>Downside</strong>: Recovering from a key compromise is difficult or impossible because there is no mechanism for the server to notify clients of a key compromise, except by pushing a new keypair to all clients. Consider that an attacker has the server's private key and can intercept traffic between the client and server (both to block the updated keypair push, and to man-in-the-middle the client's connection to the server). The client will trust the attacker and believe that it is talking to the authentic server and there is nothing you can do to prevent this because at a fundamental level, pre-shared secrets have no revocation mechanism.</p>\n<h2>Certificate</h2>\n<p>Yes, it's annoying (and sometimes expensive) to get a certificate, but the trust no longer depends on your ability to push the pre-shared key to the clients.</p>\n<p>Part of the validation process for a certificate is for the client to reach out to the CA and ensure that the certificate is not revoked and if it fails to reach the CA, this counts as a failure. Spoofing this revocation check requires the attacker to compromise not only the server's private key, but the CA's private key as well. If the server realizes that it's keypair has been compromised and asks the CA to revoke it, all clients will know immediately because the online revocation checks will fail.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Revocation is the main reason to use certificates here, but also consider that an attacker can intercept the initial public key push and replace it with their own public key. Maybe you are the network admin and can guarentee to deploy the public keys securely, but certificates make this a moot point because even if the attacker can intercept the certificate deployment, spoofing a cert requires compromising the CA.</p>\n"

All communication occurs over HTTPS and a random 32 bit integer identifies the user.

But I have no reference point... what kind of adversary would the current system fail against? What kind of adversary would my idea fail against?</p>\n\n<p>The argument in support of the current system is that we are a small player with small customers in a large world so we're not expecting to be attacked, and if we are attacked we do have some level of security. My thought is that security threats are becoming more numerous and more sophisticated pretty quickly, and we do happen to be in an industry where security is a concern. I don't want to give specifics here just because I may be pointing out the existence of a poorly secured live system, but perhaps someone knowledgeable could speak to current trends in security threats?</p>\n\n<p>I would appreciate any input on this topic, and if for some reason my question is inadequate please let me know so I can update it accordingly rather than marking it to be closed!</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

In that case, the best an attacker can do is to try potential user IDs (32-bit values) in any order until a proper one is found. If there are <em>N</em> valid user ID, then the average number of tries that the attacker will need to perform will be close <em>2<sup>32</sup>/(N+1)</em>: if there are one thousand of users, then the attacker will need to connect about 4 million times to your server before being granted access. Once the attacker gains access, he can reuse the ID at will.</p>\n\n<p>Your only defence in that case is to try to detect such brute forcing, e.g. by banning IP addresses from which come too many failed attempts. This has limitations; in particular, when many people are behind some kind of Web proxy or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation\">NAT</a>, they may, from your point of view, share the same IP address, so you risk disabling a lost of users with a lockout strategy. Conversely, attackers can rent botnets in order to perform their one-time brute force from a lot of distinct IP addresses.</p>\n\n<p>One way to look at it is indeed to consider the user ID to be some kind of password; in that view, the attacker can attack the passwords for all users simultaneously. The security level is thereby lowered when there are more users, as can be seen in the mathematical expression above: more users means more targets for the attacker, without increasing the search cost.</p>\n\n<p>A login+password strategy is what most people do. This is much better: when trying to brute force a password, the attacker must select a specific user name, and will be able to break only that specific password. The \"user name\" is a non-secret piece of information that is specific to each user. With user names, the attacker's task is no longer a thousand times easier when there are a thousand of users. As for a \"session token\", well, there are several methods which are more or less equivalent (token in the URL, token as a POST parameter, token as a HTTP header -- also known as a \"cookie\" --, and so on); SSL itself has its own notion of session and you could reuse that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> the \"secret user ID\" with no user name strategy <em>can</em> be secure, but only if the space of possible user ID is large enough to defeat brute force, even if there are many valid user ID. This requires large user ID which <em>must</em> be selected randomly and uniformly. 128 bits would be enough. 64 bits would make me quite nervous. 32 bits are way too small.</p>\n"

                "content": " <p>To answer your first question: No, I don't believe you have much to worry about. In particular, they <em>are</em> authenticating themselves, and I think you have some confusion in terminology going on here. The fact that the auth token is in the request body doesn't change anything about authentication. Many API calls work this way (although passing the auth token in the header may be more common). If you contacted them and tried to address the lack of authentication (like you are here) I'm sure they would have dismissed your concerns, because they are in fact authenticating themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding your concerns over DDOS, the difference between getting an auth token out of a header (which is probably the only other place it can live) and parsing it out of a JSON body is very minimal from the perspective of CPU usage. I don't expect it to make any practical difference in helping an attacker succeed in a DDOS attack. In all likelihood you have much more CPU intensive pages than this anyway, so if someone were to perform a targeted attack against your system and take the time to try to find the weakest endpoint, there are probably many much more tempting pages to be found.</p>\n\n<p>However, even that isn't a real concern. Most DDOS attacks these days work by simply throwing as many requests at the target as possible to saturate their network bandwidth.  As a result, the actual endpoint doesn't even matter, and the requests the attackers send are very rarely valid requests anyway. I doubt many attackers would bother doing more than looking up the IP address of your server(s), and there are probably very few circumstances in which they would first spend time looking around your website trying to find the most vulnerable page.</p>\n\n<p>If you are concerned about DDOS get a DDOS mitigation partner like cloud flare. As Josef mentions, you can also try IP address limits on the page. However, there are much more effective ways to spend your time to protect your site against DDOS then trying to change the API structure of a third party service when your application has plenty more endpoints for an attacker to hit anyway.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Clarifications</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the security world no answers are especially helpful without good threat modeling.  As a result, it's worth breaking down the \"threat model\" you are concerned about.  Having a request that passes the auth token in the body is important <strong>if</strong>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Someone is targeting your system for DDOS attack</li>\n<li>They don't have enough bandwidth at their disposal to simply overrun your network resources (<a href=\"https://www.incapsula.com/blog/new-ddos-attack-method-demands-a-fresh-approach-to-amplification-assault-mitigation.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DDOS of network resources via amplifications attacks alone accounts for ~half of all DDOS attacks</a>)</li>\n<li>They therefore decide to target particular endpoints in your system that are resource-intensive</li>\n<li>They happen to stumble upon this unpublished endpoint and are able to figure out how the API call works</li>\n<li>They don't find another endpoint in your system that is more resource intensive</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If all of those conditions are met, then indeed, someone might use this endpoint to DDOS your system, and the difference between authentication in the header and in the body may in fact matter.  However, in case it isn't clear, <strong>these conditions are never going to be met</strong>.  If someone wants to DDOS your systems they will probably just go off and <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3180246/data-protection/hire-a-ddos-service-to-take-down-your-enemies.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rent a DDOS</a> that will flood your systems with meaningless network traffic.  It is both easier and more effective then trying to identify an actual weak point in your system.  This is the primary reason why this doesn't matter from the perspective of a DDOS: the DDOS attack you are worried about is never going to happen because there are easier and faster ways to DDOS a website than this.  The only way to protect against realistic kinds of DDOS attacks is with a DDOS mitigation provider.</p>\n\n<p>This is why threat modeling and understanding real world threats is so important.  You can spend weeks working with a third party provider to change their API in a way that minimizes CPU time on your end, only to then have your systems knocked out by a DDOS that blindly sends invalid requests into your network and overwhelms your network capacity.  If you spend your time protecting against the wrong kinds of threats, you can end up wasting a lot of time and (more importantly) implementing the wrong kinds of safe guards.</p>\n"

It fills an array with the time of mouse movement events in the even cells and the mouse position in the odd cells, sprinkles some magic shuffling over it (shuffling memory, xoring fields), and calls some RSA/DSA/EC* key generator with the array as argument. Whether there is serious evidence that mouse movement is a good entropy source is quite important for such use-cases. Note that this is different from using it as an <em>additional</em> source, such as in the Linux kernel, which will only increase the quality even if it's a mediocre source.</p>\n\n<p>I have a hard time believing nobody ever looked into this.

                "content": " <p>I do not believe there are any research papers that describe the unpredictability of the neuromuscular system in the context of computer security and at the sample rates that are relevant, so I can't link the research papers you want. However, I <em>can</em> explain at least a few of the reasons why human movement is so stochastic and unpredictable. It all boils down to a simple fact: Living tissue is a really, really sloppy medium for information transmission. This has been known for a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392564/pdf/jphysiol01439-0123.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">very long time</a> and has constantly been a thorn in the side of computational neuroscientists and anyone trying to make mathematical models of neuron groups. Biological neural networks are terrible computers.</p>\n<p>The transmission speed of neurons varies, sometimes significantly. Even within a single neuron, the speed is variable. In addition, the number of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">action potentials</a> (electrical signals that propagate down the axon) sent in succession is dependent on the probability that microscopic ion channels will open at any given time. Additionally, muscles have a high amount of jitter. The force from a muscle does not come from a gradual increase in activity, but from discrete bunches of muscle cells, called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_unit_recruitment\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">motor units</a>, being activated. Even if we flex as hard as we can, we never activate 100% of the muscle's motor units (if we did, it could cause physical damage to the tendon). This random motor unit recruitment leads  to the twitchy vibration typical of voluntary skeletal muscles.</p>\n<p>The combination of the <em>extremely</em> stochastic behavior of neurons and the probabilistic activation of muscle cells leads to minute variable delays in timing. While these delays are imperceptible to a human, a computer ticking away at billions of times per second (yeah, I know this is actually limited by the speed of the keyboard microcontroller, among other things) quickly notices this. Millions of cycles can pass by due to the random delays intrinsic to neural transmission, and these random delays can be measured and used as a source of entropy. While we do not have any research showing exactly how many bits of entropy each action potential will generate, we can make an extremely conservative guess and say that the entire process, from brain to muscle to keystroke, leaves us with around a single bit of entropy. All it takes then is a few hundred keystrokes to obtain a cryptographically significant amount of entropy.</p>\n<p>The stochastic behavior of the human brain is described quite well <a href=\"https://human-brain.org/n-brain-symbols.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (see sections 3 and 4).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Entropy from keystrokes or mouse movements thus comes from two sources:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Individual variations in people due to a unique number neurons and unique neural circuits.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Time-dependent variations in action potential transmission speed, motor unit recruitment, etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All of this results in random delays that, while irrelevant to everyday tasks, is quite visible to a computer with sometimes even sub-nanosecond temporal resolution. If we sample the time of events (not just data like mouse pointer position or key being pressed), we can safely say that it contains at least a nominal amount of entropy. After all, given all this stochastic randomness, it should become obvious that it is impossible to guess, within nanoseconds, how long it will take a signal originating in our brain to trigger a muscle to contract to depress a key.</p>\n<p>However, it's important to know that it's easy to get entropy collection wrong. You can't just sample mouse movement and use system time as a clock. You need to trigger the sampling <em>immediately</em> when the event occurs. This means collection must occur within the kernel, typically within an interrupt handler that is executed instantly when an interrupt occurs. Otherwise, it's very possible that predictable scheduling delays will taint the collected entropy. After all, what's the good of a random keypress event if it's buffered as soon as it occurs and is only released to userspace in predictable intervals? You should always leave entropy collection to the OS itself.</p>\n"

Doing iisreset everytime I edit something, but without any luck.</p>\n\n<p>It feels like the class names and id's in the xml and xsl files aren't present in the actual page, and the other way around.</p>\n\n<p>So I was wondering if anyone in here had done the same earlier, because I'm running out of ideas on where to edit these files to make the changes appear on the page.</p>\n\n<p>I made a new ViewStyle in the xml file (copied from the \"ViewStylePicLibDetailsName\" style) and copied the same ID in the xsl file and gave both new ID's and a new name for my ViewStyle. That seems to work well, but none of the changes I make appear on the page.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the ViewStyle in my vwstyles.xml file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ViewStyle ID=\"21\"

It's simple enough to create a variable for the path to insert into the filter, but when it comes to the username, passing a variable in its place does not seem to work using any method I have tried. CAML (or at least the pseudo-CAML used in filters) likes the user's name to actually be the name <strong>field</strong> (in this case, pulled from AD) not the <strong>account</strong> name. So after a little playing around I figured out how to turn that into a variable to pass into the filter like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>string userName = vUser.Name;\nstring oFilter = (\"&lt;Query&gt;&lt;And&gt;&lt;Or&gt;&lt;Eq&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='ItemFullUrl'/&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + fullPath + \"&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Eq&gt;&lt;BeginsWith&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='ItemFullUrl'/&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + fullPath + \"/&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/BeginsWith&gt;&lt;/Or&gt;&lt;Neq&gt;&lt;Value type='string'&gt;\" + userName + \"&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name='Editor/New'/&gt;&lt;/Neq&gt;&lt;/And&gt;&lt;/Query&gt;)\");\noAlert.Filter = oFilter;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The user.Name property outputs a name that matches the format in the CAML filter of a working alert I examined. If I type the name directly into the filter it works fine, but when I try to pass it as a variable it breaks, even if I explicitly set the variable to \"User Name\".</p>\n\n<p>Is there some part of how the filter/string works that I'm not accounting for? Every search I've done online has said this method should work, in theory. My goal is simply to make the alert apply only to changes made by other users, is there perhaps another way to accomplish that?</p>\n\n<p>Any advice is greatly appreciated!</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

There are also automatically available metadata, such as the modified/create properties, but everything depends on how you need to filter the calendar. </p>\n\n<p>Once you have your metadata in place, filtering may begin. Filtering can be done with whichever semi-complex ajax/REST calls you'd imagine, but SharePoint has OOTB fairly well working web parts for the job. I should note that if you still decide to create a filter with e.g. a REST API call, you would need to <em>hardcode</em> the property (i.e. a column) of a calendar list item to your call.</p>\n\n<p>So what I'm saying is you could do this in a <strong>REST API call</strong> such as</p>\n\n<pre><code>$.ajax({\n    url: _spPageContextInfo.webAbsoluteUrl + \"/_api/Web/Lists/GetByTitle('Calendar')/items?$select=Title,Column3&amp;$filter=(Column eq '\"+customVariable+\"')&amp;$top=40\",\n    type: \"GET\",\n    dataType: \"json\",\n    headers: {\n        Accept: \"application/json;odata=verbose\"\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but I would suggest you to not rush into a custom code solution.</p>\n\n<p>Instead a more straight-forward implementation can be done by using the OOTB <strong>filter web parts</strong> namely <em>Choice Filter</em>, <em>Date Filter</em>, <em>Text Filter</em> or another fitting to your needs.</p>\n\n<p>Filter web parts are added to your page where the calendar's view has been added too. The web part connection is done from the filter web part's properties at the <em>Connections</em>-section by defining the Calendar in the <em>Send Filter Values To</em> selection.</p>\n\n<p>Because different filter web parts have different use cases and slightly varying usage, I should forward you to Microsoft's documentation for <a href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/connect-a-filter-web-part-to-a-list-view-web-part-on-a-classic-page-4f3f6c10-0a1b-479d-8b4d-c4f1bf49bb3f\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Connect a Filter Web Part to a List View Web Part on a classic page</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To summarize, <strong>(1)</strong> make sure you have the metadata for your filtering needs, <strong>(2)</strong> determine is there a chance you might need to change your filtering behavior - or whether you want it to be more user-driven instead of hardcoded, and finally <strong>(3)</strong> implement the solution around your need.</p>\n\n<p>The benefits of using a custom code solution are that the filtering when using ajax can be more user-friendly and it supports the \"on the fly\" behavior. The drawbacka are a more time consuming implementation and maintainability. The benefits of using OOTB web parts are the ease of setup and directly available user-driven inputs. The drawbacks with OOTB web parts are user-experience (e.g. incomplete text-filtering may not function as expected) and lack of support for more complex filter requirements.</p>\n"

Passing information via the query string is one technique to overcome this behavior.</p>\n\n<p>The SharePoint App model uses them for this purpose as well. <code>{StandardTokens}</code>, for example, provides a SharePoint app with the Host URL, the App web's URL, the language of the referring SharePoint site, the client cache control number (a way to look up information using another method for persisting data between requests), as well as the full build version of the SharePoint farm.</p>\n\n<p>Information such as this is very important to your SharePoint App, regardless of where it is hosted. Common uses include telling your App where to send queries for information that live in the host web (need the host web URL to do that), providing navigation options so your users can get back to the SharePoint site they came from, fetching styling information to match the referring SharePoint environment, and much more.</p>\n\n<p>Specifying which tokens to include in the App Manifest (like in your screenshot) simply handles all of the details of making sure links to your App have all of this information in them for you --  that way your App is ready to run when a user visits it.</p>\n"

I'm wondering how to structure this in terms of sites/subsites/site collections.</p>\n\n<p>My initial thoughts is to have a site collection where the top-level site for\nthe collection is the public-facing publishing side of things.  </p>\n\n<p>But then I'm not sure whether 'Company' and 'Products' should be subsites of the \ntop-level publishing site, or simply pages within the top-level publishing site.\nAs Company and Products are just collections of basic HTML content, to have each one as a 'subsite' feels like overkill, but that may just be because I'm\nnot used to the terminology.  I would ordinarily just think of them as subsections of a website.</p>\n\n<p>The 'Support' section is essentially a set of embedded mini-applications such\nas issue tracking.  As it is more substantial, and is not viewable by anonymous users, it feels like it would warrant being at least a subsite, or maybe it should be a separate site collection?</p>\n\n<p>I would guess that the 'behind-the-scenes' portal, only accessible by employees, with features such as dashboards/collaborative wiki, would again be in a separate site collection.</p>\n\n<p>I guess my general question is, <strong>what are the rules of thumb for when to use a site, when to use a subsite, and when to use a site collection</strong>?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

This means that most work will be done on a\nsingle row).</li>\n<li>Each customer who uses this software will require amendments,\nadditional columns/fields or changes in column names and maybe\nbusiness logic. Each customer may require updates which change the\ndatabase structure. The idea is that anything that can be customized, any\nclient specific requirements will live within these classes.</li>\n<li>There will be reporting, mainly involving pulling records matching\nparticular categories, word searches, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have the database schema done and laid out, and the logic of how tables\nrelate is clear.  I have used this very schema in another framework, but a web based app doesn't seem to offer the level of power to the user with regards to the GUI, which is essential to differentiate this product from the others.</p>\n\n<p>My question is how to design classes around the database. It is important to\nget this right, so that the architecture of the software doesn't have to be\nredesigned later on. The classes will not be responsible for the persistent\nstore, only for acting as an intermediary between the layer responsible for\nthe persistent store and the controllers/views.</p>\n\n<p>The most logical approach appears to be to have a class for non-conformances/complaints etc, which solely store the instance (ie, one object per non-conformance record), validate data and class specific business logic (ie, computations).  One class per table seems logical in this case.  What I'm struggling with, is whether it is standard practice to simply have data members for each column, define getters and setters, or whether I should create a class which isn't hard-coded to map to a table, but which populates a map based on the database schema or external file which defines the database and column properties. The former means that the coding for the class needs to be changed when columns are modified, the latter potentially not.  Keep in mind, for the majority of the time, each user will be working with one record at at time.</p>\n\n<p>In short, I can see example of how to do SQL queries, but I've struggled to\nfind anything which shows me what the class should look like (or if this entire approach is wrong) and I'd like to compare what I'm doing, with what the industry would define as good practice (I'm not a programmer by trade).</p>\n\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

You really should look at refactoring this completely so that you don't have to make the decision.</p>\n\n<p>The issue is that the semantics of <code>doThing()</code> seem to be very ill defined.  One subclass makes it do one thing (an operation \"now\") and one subclass defines it to do another thing (queuing an even to be done \"later\").  The reason you're struggling with the best way to tie these two together in the <code>Foo</code> class is that they <em>shouldn't</em> be tied together.</p>\n\n<p>If you must do one of these designs, I recommend Design 1 unless you have a strong reason to pick Design 2.  Design 2 is typically seen as an anti-pattern.  If you see code like that, it says \"The writers of <code>Foo</code> knew every way <code>Foo</code> would be used and all conditions where it would be used.  They knew all subclasses and how they should operate.\"  In general, this is against the spirit of OO programming.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, there are exceptions to every rule.  One case study is trees.  Sometimes you have a structure like a scene graph or an abstract syntax tree where you know ahead of time <em>all</em> of the possible nodes that could ever appear.  In cases like this, it can be convenient to implement functions like <code>bool isNow()</code> or <code>Later asLater()</code> rather than doing the more formal OO approach using visitors.  But this should be treated as a special case.  If you aren't <em>positive</em> you're in this situation, you shouldn't go down that path.  Thus Design 1 functions better than Design 2.  But you really should be warry of having one abstract function <code>doThing()</code> doing two rather different operations.</p>\n\n<p>If your function is nothing more than <code>doThing()</code> or <code>execute()</code>, you might get away with this.  But if what you really wrote was something like <code>doConnect()</code>, where <code>Now</code> immediately makes a connection to a server while <code>Later</code> does an async call to make the connection later, then you'll likely get in trouble by getting confused as to what is really happening when you call that function.</p>\n"

Based on those observations, they designed operator precedence in Fortress. This is the only instance I know of where a Programming Language Designer has explicitly written down their rationale for Operator Precedence.</p>\n\n<p>Operator Precedence in Fortress works a little bit different from other languages. The main difference is that there is no globally defined precedence across all operators. Instead, operators have <em>relative</em> precedence to other operators: <code>*</code> is-higher-than <code>+</code>, for example. Using two operators in the same expression without explicit parentheses that do not have a defined operator precedence, is a Syntax Error. In other words: the precedence relation is not a total ordering, it is in fact not even a partial ordering, it isn't an ordering at all because the relationship is not transitive: even if operator <strong>X</strong> is defined to be tighter than <strong>Y</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> is defined to be tighter than <strong>Z</strong>, that does not mean that <strong>X</strong> is tighter than <strong>Z</strong> and you are not allowed to mix <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Z</strong> in the same expression without parentheses because they do not have a defined relative precedence.</p>\n\n<p>This neatly side-steps questions such as \"should the string concatenation operator have higher or lower precedence than bitwise-XOR?\" Well, neither. It doesn't make sense to mix the two in the same expression, so they don't have a defined relative precedence. And if you <em>do</em> mix the two, then you need to use parentheses.</p>\n\n<p>In general, operators in Fortress only have a defined relative precedence, if they are commonly used together in the same expression in scientific papers and there is a general consensus in the scientific community what the precedence should be.</p>\n\n<p>There is also another nice feature: the programmer can use whitespace to indicate what he thinks the precedence should be (but not override precedence). So, you can write <code>a\u00d7b+c</code>, you can write <code>a \u00d7 b + c</code>, you can write <code>a\u00d7b + c</code>, but you cannot write <code>a \u00d7 b+c</code>, the latter is again a Syntax Error. (And yes, Fortress uses the times symbol for multiplication, not the asterisk. It also uses \u2227 and \u2228 for logical-conjunction and logical-disjunction, \u222a and \u2229 for union and intersection, it uses actual subscripting for array subscripting and uses superscript for exponentiation.)</p>\n\n<p>A third nice feature is that Fortress has a juxtaposition operator, i.e. an operator for writing two expressions next to each other. For example, for numbers, juxtaposition is defined as multiplication, i.e. in the example above, I could have written <code>a b + c</code> instead of <code>a \u00d7 b + c</code>. For unary functions, juxtaposition is application, so <code>f(x)</code> and <code>f x</code> are equivalent.</p>\n"

In production, you can compile the modules into a single resource.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So when you guarantee that all needed JS modules are there on page load, I don't see the need for something like AMD. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How do you guarantee that all needed modules are there on page load? If you use AMD modules, each module knows its own dependencies and you can point a tool like RequireJS Optimizer at a single entrypoint module and be done with it. You could also reuse the same modules in other apps (including single-page apps) without changing anything; the modules can be loaded individually or combined into single resources.</p>\n\n<p>If you go the namespace route, you'll need to track which modules are needed for each page, manage the entire dependency graph for each entrypoint module, and manage the compilation process yourself somehow.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the script loader is not the only benefit of AMD. The other major benefit is that each module is responsible for its own dependencies (rather than just assuming that some namespaces exist, and leaving it up to the developer to ensure that the required namespaces are set up before the module can do its thing).</p>\n"

Why?  Part of it is that the shell commands are easier to use.  <code>show databases;</code> says what it does and does what it says. I looked that up once, the first time. Never did again. When I use psql, I can rarely remember. Is it <code>\\dl</code> or just <code>\\l</code>? No wait, isn't <code>\\dl</code> something else? Huh, do I really want <code>\\dn</code>? Shoot, ok, what's the command for help? <code>\\help</code>? No, that's a list of SQL commands.  Where is the list of shell commands? Ah. <code>\\?</code> has the list. WHY is <code>\\?</code> different from <code>\\help</code>?</p>\n\n<p>Yeah if I used it all the time I'd get used to it. That's not the point.

Is there a better method when you have, say 100 or 1000 possible cases? Assume polymorphism isn't applicable and each case has totally unique functions which cannot be abstracted further.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Just to clarify, this is a thought experiment, I'm not actually writing code with 1000 cases. Also I found this related question to be enlightening on how the compiler/JIT handle the issue: <a href=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/79111/why-use-an-oo-approach-instead-of-a-giant-switch-statement\">Why use an OO approach instead of a giant &quot;switch&quot; statement?</a></p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

If you really want to scale you need a O(1) algorithm, so you create an array or dictionary which maps the integer values to delegates, pick the delegate based on the int, and executes it.</strike></p>\n\n<p>I was wrong: Apparently a switch with enough branches are compiled into a jump table or a dictionary lookup anyway. So you can't do faster than a switch.</p>\n"

Nothing should be going to prod that is not part of an official release. All too many times, people do a quick fix on prod that either doesn't work, causing prod to be even more mucked up or works but they forget to put the code into the dev/QA/Staging servers and even worse into the source control repository and the code gets overwritten about a month later in the next offical release. </p>\n\n<p>I prefer devs to have full database QA rights because deploying to another server helps them see if there are any gaps in their deployment process (oops forgot that I changed that table in order to do thus and such and oops I forgot that I did that change using the GUI and not in a script in source control which is how any database structural changes need to happen). </p>\n\n<p>When you have a new Enterprise-type client who will have their own set of servers, permissions may be eased before going live. This is because so much needs to happen and the few people who can make it happen on prod get backlogged and sometimes even need to take time off. In particular the people who are importing data from another system, might get tasked to put them on prod before launch if the dataload is going to take a long time. These people tend to be data specialists and there is a higher comfort level with allowing them temporary access to prod than the average application dev. This is not a luxury you have when going to an already live production server. </p>\n\n<p>One of the most critical things about limiting production rights to the database is that the devs then need to ensure their work is in a form that can be deployed by someone else. This tends to improve the quality of the work because they aren't trying to make fixes on the fly becasue they forgot something or something didn't work becasue they did it differently on prod than deve when relying on memory alone. You also lose those \"oops I deleted the whole user table by accident because I forgot to hightlight a where clause\" type of accidents when prod deployments are purely using scripts that are run as a whole not one command at a time as is typical when devs run things on prod. A team with limited rights to prod databases is more likely to store database changes in source control as well.</p>\n"

Knowing that it's a throw-away code helps focusing on the actual feature, while leaving aside aspects such as maintainability of the code, style, design patterns or testing. This makes it possible to finish the prototype very fast, without affecting negatively the technical debt of the final product.</p>\n\n<p>Throw-away prototyping is different from <strong>sketching</strong>. Sketching is more graphical and oriented towards user interfaces and user experience, and doesn't consist of writing programming code. Throw-away prototyping is usually used when sketching is not enough (for example when you need to show how a feature will perform on different smartphones or when you need to show the actual performance and responsiveness).</p>\n\n<p>Throw-away prototyping can present a risk when dealing with stakeholders without technical background and in a context of tight deadlines and very limited resources: stakeholders may try to convince you to reuse in the final product the source code from the prototype. It is natural to believe that it will shorten the time required to release the product, but actually, it will only delay the shipment date. One way to prevent this is to use for the prototype a language which can't be used in production (for example use C# when you know that the final product will be hosted on Linux servers with only Python installed).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/n1Lh4.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p><sup>Fig. 1: <em>Throw-away prototyping and sketching</em> : prototypes help gathering early feedback before starting developing the actual feature.</sup></p>\n\n<h2>Evolutionary prototyping</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Evolutionary prototyping</strong> consists of building a prototype which is then refined based on the regular feedback from the stakeholders or potential users.</p>\n\n<p>Here, maintainability of the code, style, design patterns or testing count from the beginning, which makes it possible to evolve the prototype into a fully featured, enterprise-grade product. The earlier steps of the prototype contain only the core part of the future product, and then, features are added progressively.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F8EBM.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p><sup>Fig. 2: <em>Evolutionary prototyping</em> : features are aggregated to the prototype to build the final product.</sup></p>\n\n<p>Evolutionary prototyping is different from <strong>incremental prototyping</strong>. Incremental prototyping consists of building several prototypes, each one representing a part of the future system, and then combine them. Evolutionary prototyping is closer to Agile: often, you will be able to obtain early a working product with limited features and extend it until stakeholder have money. Incremental prototyping, on the other hand, is better suited for large projects with many contributing teams, each team working on a separate prototype.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ze8C.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p><sup>Fig. 3: <em>Incremental prototyping</em> : several prototypes are combined to form the final product.</sup></p>\n\n<p>Evolutionary prototyping is different from <strong>Agile methodologies</strong> too. Agile is about iterations and frequent milestones where a fully functional product can be released to manufacturing. If you have a working product every Thursday, you're doing Agile. In evolutionary prototyping, you expand the prototype, but nothing forces you to have a fully-functional product regularly. You can spend two months creating the first prototype, than expand it with a few features in respectively two and three days, and then spend three months on another feature. You can't have this sort of irregular patterns in Agile.</p>\n\n<p>Specific Agile methodologies enforce additional rules. For example, if you don't do pair programming, you can't assert that you're doing Extreme Programming. If your team don't have daily meetings, you're not doing Scrum.</p>\n"

Note that the types <code>S</code> and <code>Z</code> don't have any member values - only types of kind <code>*</code> are inhabited by values.</p>\n\n<p>Now we introduce a <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/GADT\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GADT</a> representing vectors with a known length.

It's defined recursively - whenever the left operand is greater than <code>Z</code>ero we add one to the output and reduce it by one in the recursive call. (It's a good exercise to write a type function which multiplies two <code>Nat</code>s.) Now we can make <code>+++</code> compile:</p>\n\n<pre><code>infixr 5 +++\n(+++) :: Vec n a -&gt; Vec m a -&gt; Vec (n :+: m) a\nVNil +++ ys = ys\n(VCons x xs) +++ ys = VCons x (concat xs ys)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's how you use it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; VCons 1 (VCons 2 VNil) +++ VCons 3 (VCons 4 VNil)\nVCons 1 (VCons 2 (VCons 3 (VCons 4 VNil)))\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So far so simple. What about when we want to do the opposite of concatenation and split a vector in two? The lengths of the output vectors depend on the runtime value of the arguments. We'd like to write something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-- this won't work because there aren't any values of type `S` and `Z`\n-- split :: (n :: Nat) -&gt; Vec (n :+: m) a -&gt; (Vec n a, Vec m a)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but unfortunately Haskell won't let us do that. Allowing the <em>value</em> of the <code>n</code> argument to appear in the <em>return type</em> (this is commonly called a <em>dependent function</em> or <em>pi type</em>) would require \"full-spectrum\" dependent types, whereas <code>DataKinds</code> only gives us promoted type constructors. To put it another way, the type constructors <code>S</code> and <code>Z</code> don't appear at the value level. We'll have to settle for <a href=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eir/papers/2012/singletons/paper.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>singleton values</em></a> for a run-time representation of a certain <code>Nat</code>.*</p>\n\n<pre><code>data Natty (n :: Nat) where\n    Zy :: Natty Z  -- pronounced 'zed-y'\n    Sy :: Natty n -&gt; Natty (S n)  -- pronounced 'ess-y'\nderiving instance Show (Natty n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For a given type <code>n</code> (with kind <code>Nat</code>), there is precisely one term of type <code>Natty n</code>. We can use the singleton value as a run-time witness for <code>n</code>: learning about a <code>Natty</code> teaches us about its <code>n</code> and vice versa.</p>\n\n<pre><code>split :: Natty n -&gt;\n         Vec (n :+: m) a -&gt;  -- the input Vec has to be at least as long as the input Natty\n         (Vec n a, Vec m a)\nsplit Zy xs = (Nil, xs)\nsplit (Sy n) (Cons x xs) = let (ys, zs) = split n xs\n                           in (Cons x ys, zs)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let's take it for a spin:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; split (Sy (Sy Zy)) (VCons 1 (VCons 2 (VCons 3 VNil)))\n(VCons 1 (VCons 2 VNil), VCons 3 VNil)\nghci&gt; split (Sy (Sy Zy)) (VCons 3 VNil)\n&lt;interactive&gt;:116:21:\n    Couldn't match type \u2018'S ('Z :+: m)\u2019 with \u2018'Z\u2019\n    Expected type: Vec ('S ('S 'Z) :+: m) a\n      Actual type: Vec ('S 'Z) a\n    Relevant bindings include\n      it :: (Vec ('S ('S 'Z)) a, Vec m a) (bound at &lt;interactive&gt;:116:1)\n    In the second argument of \u2018split\u2019, namely \u2018(VCons 3 VNil)\u2019\n    In the expression: split (Sy (Sy Zy)) (VCons 3 VNil)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the first example, we successfully split a three-element vector at position 2; then we got a type error when we tried to split a vector at a position past the end. Singletons are the standard technique for making a type depend on a value in Haskell.</p>\n\n<p><sub>* The <a href=\"https://hackage.haskell.org/package/singletons\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>singletons</code> library</a> contains some Template Haskell helpers to generate singleton values like <code>Natty</code> for you.</sub></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Last example. What about when you don't know the dimensionality of your vector statically? For example, what if we're trying to build a vector from run-time data in the form of a list? You need the <em>type</em> of the vector to depend on the <em>length</em> of the input list. To put it another way, we can't use <code>foldr VCons VNil</code> to build a vector because the type of the output vector changes with each iteration of the fold. We need to keep the length of the vector a secret from the compiler.</p>\n\n<pre><code>data AVec a = forall n. AVec (Natty n) (Vec n a)\nderiving instance (Show a) =&gt; Show (AVec a)\n\nfromList :: [a] -&gt; AVec a\nfromList = Prelude.foldr cons nil\n    where cons x (AVec n xs) = AVec (Sy n) (VCons x xs)\n          nil = AVec Zy VNil\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>AVec</code> is an <a href=\"https://wiki.haskell.org/Existential_type\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>existential type</em></a>: the type variable <code>n</code> does not appear in the return type of the <code>AVec</code> data constructor. We're using it to simulate a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type#Dependent_pair_type\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>dependent pair</em></a>: <code>fromList</code> can't tell you the length of the vector statically, but it can return something you can pattern-match on to <em>learn</em> the length of the vector - the <code>Natty n</code> in the first element of the tuple. As Conor McBride puts it in <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/27030038/1523776\">a related answer</a>, \"You look at one thing, and in doing so, learn about another\".</p>\n\n<p>This is a common technique for existentially quantified types. Because you can't actually do anything with data for which you don't know the type - try writing a function of <code>data Something = forall a. Sth a</code> - existentials often come bundled up with GADT evidence which allows you to recover the original type by performing pattern-matching tests. Other common patterns for existentials include packaging up functions to process your type (<code>data AWayToGetTo b = forall a. HeresHow a (a -&gt; b)</code>) which is a neat way of doing first-class modules, or building-in a type class dictionary (<code>data AnOrd = forall a. Ord a =&gt; AnOrd a</code>) which can help emulate subtype polymorphism.</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; fromList [1,2,3]\nAVec (Sy (Sy (Sy Zy))) (VCons 1 (VCons 2 (VCons 3 Nil)))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Dependent pairs are useful whenever the static properties of data depend on dynamic information not available at compile time. Here's <code>filter</code> for vectors:</p>\n\n<pre><code>filter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Vec n a -&gt; AVec a\nfilter f = foldr (\\x (AVec n xs) -&gt; if f x\n                                    then AVec (Sy n) (VCons x xs)\n                                    else AVec n xs) (AVec Zy VNil) \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To <code>dot</code> two <code>AVec</code>s, we need to prove to GHC that their lengths are equal. <a href=\"https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.2/docs/Data-Type-Equality.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>Data.Type.Equality</code></a> defines a GADT which can only be constructed when its type arguments are the same:</p>\n\n<pre><code>data (a :: k) :~: (b :: k) where\n    Refl :: a :~: a  -- short for 'reflexivity'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When you pattern-match on <code>Refl</code>, GHC knows that <code>a ~ b</code>. There are also a few functions to help you work with this type: we'll be using <a href=\"https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.2/docs/Data-Type-Equality.html#g:2\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>gcastWith</code></a> to convert between equivalent types, and <a href=\"https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.2/docs/Data-Type-Equality.html#g:3\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>TestEquality</code></a> to determine whether two <code>Natty</code>s are equal.</p>\n\n<p>To test the equality of two <code>Natty</code>s, we're going to need to make use of the fact that if two numbers are equal, then their successors are also equal (<code>:~:</code> is <em>congruent</em> over <code>S</code>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>congSuc :: (n :~: m) -&gt; (S n :~: S m)\ncongSuc Refl = Refl\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Pattern matching on <code>Refl</code> on the left-hand side lets GHC know that <code>n ~ m</code>. With that knowledge, it's trivial that <code>S n ~ S m</code>, so GHC lets us return a new <code>Refl</code> right away.</p>\n\n<p>Now we can write an instance of <code>TestEquality</code> by straightforward recursion. If both numbers are zero, they are equal. If both numbers have predecessors, they are equal iff the predecessors are equal. (If they're not equal, just return <code>Nothing</code>.)</p>\n\n<pre><code>instance TestEquality Natty where\n    -- testEquality :: Natty n -&gt; Natty m -&gt; Maybe (n :~: m)\n    testEquality Zy Zy = Just Refl\n    testEquality (Sy n) (Sy m) = fmap congSuc (testEquality n m)  -- check whether the predecessors are equal, then make use of congruence\n    testEquality Zy _ = Nothing\n    testEquality _ Zy = Nothing\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we can put the pieces together to <code>dot</code> a pair of <code>AVec</code>s of unknown length.</p>\n\n<pre><code>dot' :: Num a =&gt; AVec a -&gt; AVec a -&gt; Maybe a\ndot' (AVec n u) (AVec m v) = fmap (\\proof -&gt; gcastWith proof (dot u v)) (testEquality n m)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>First, pattern match on the <code>AVec</code> constructor to pull out a runtime representation of the vectors' lengths. Now use <code>testEquality</code> to determine whether those lengths are equal. If they are, we'll have <code>Just Refl</code>; <code>gcastWith</code> will use that equality proof to ensure that <code>dot u v</code> is well-typed by discharging its implicit <code>n ~ m</code> assumption.</p>\n\n<pre><code>ghci&gt; let v1 = fromList [1,2,3]\nghci&gt; let v2 = fromList [4,5,6]\nghci&gt; let v3 = fromList [7,8]\nghci&gt; dot' v1 v2\nJust 32\nghci&gt; dot' v1 v3\nNothing  -- they weren't the same length\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that, since a vector without static knowledge of its length is basically a list, we've effectively re-implemented the list version of <code>dot :: Num a =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; Maybe a</code>. The difference is that this version is implemented in terms of the vectors' <code>dot</code>. Here's the point: before the type checker will allow you to call <code>dot</code>, <strong>you must have tested</strong> whether the input lists have the same length using <code>testEquality</code>. I am prone to getting <code>if</code>-statements the wrong way round, but not in a dependently-typed setting!</p>\n\n<p>You can't avoid using existential wrappers at the edges of your system, when you're dealing with runtime data, but you can use dependent types everywhere inside your system and keep the existential wrappers at the edges, when you perform input validation.</p>\n\n<p>Since <code>Nothing</code>is not very informative, you could further refine the type of <code>dot'</code> to return <em>a proof that the lengths aren't equal</em> (in the form of evidence that their difference is not 0) in the failure case. This is pretty similar to the standard Haskell technique of using <code>Either String a</code> to possibly return an error message, although a proof term is far more computationally useful than a string!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Thus ends this whistle-stop tour of some of the techniques that are common in dependently-typed Haskell programming. Programming with types like this in Haskell is really cool, but really awkward at the same time. Breaking up all your dependent data into lots of representations which mean the same thing - <code>Nat</code> the type, <code>Nat</code> the kind, <code>Natty n</code> the singleton - is really quite cumbersome, despite the existence of code-generators to help with the boilerplate. There are also presently limitations on what can be promoted to the type level. It's tantalising though! The mind boggles at the possibilities - in the literature there are examples in Haskell of strongly typed <code>printf</code>, database interfaces, UI layout engines...</p>\n\n<p>If you want some further reading, there's a growing body of literature about dependently typed Haskell, both published and on sites like Stack Overflow. A good starting point is <a href=\"https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/pub/hasochism.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the <em>Hasochism</em> paper</a> - the paper goes through this very example (among others), discussing the painful parts in some detail. <a href=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eir/papers/2012/singletons/paper.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The <em>Singletons</em> paper</a> demonstrates the technique of singleton values (such as <code>Natty</code>).

Briefly, this application allows the user to create contracts for subscribers with two constraints:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You cannot create more than one contract for a subscriber.</li>\n<li>Once a contract is created, it cannot be deleted (from the UI).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let's say TestCreate is a test case with tests for the normal creation of a contract.</p>\n\n<p>The constraints have introduced complexities to the testing process, mainly dependencies between test cases and test executions.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Before we run TestCreate we need to make sure that the application is in a suitable state (the subscriber has no contract)</li>\n<li>If we run TestCreate twice, the second run will fail since the state of the application will have changed.</li>\n<li>So we need to revert back to the initial state (i.e. delete the contract), which is impossible to do from the UI.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>More generally, after each test case we should guarantee that the state is reverted back. And since, in this case, it is impossible to do it from the UI, how do you handle this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Possible solution</strong>: I thought about doing a backup of the database in the state that I desire, and after each test case, run a script which deletes the db and restores the backup. However, I find that to be too heavy to do for each single test case. In addition, what if some information are stored in files? or in multiple or unaccessible databases? </p>\n\n<p><strong>My question:</strong> In this situation, what would an experienced tester do to write automated and maintanable tests. Thank you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>More info</strong>: I'm trying to integrate tests into a BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) framework, which I find to be a neat solution for test documentation and communication, but it does not solve this particular problem (it even makes it harder)</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

From reading <a href=\"http://improved-security.com/wiki/Randomization_%28PHP%29#Why_not_use_rand.28.29_and_mt_rand.28.29.3F\">this article</a> I understand that the random number is a number returned from a list starting at a pointer (the seed) -- but I can't imagine how this is predictable.</p>\n\n<p>Could someone reasonably figure out what random # was generated via rand() at a given moment in time within a few thousand guesses? or even 10,000 guesses? How?</p>\n\n<p>This is coming up because I saw a auth library which uses rand() to produce a token for users who have lost passwords, and I assumed this was a potential security hole. I've since replaced the method with hashing a mixture of <code>openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()</code>, the orignal hashed password, and microtime.

In particular, <strong>seeding <code>srand</code> with a predetermined number results in predictable output</strong>!  From the PHP interactive prompt:</p>\n<pre><code>[charles@charles-workstation ~]$ php -a\nInteractive shell\n\nphp &gt; srand(1024);\nphp &gt; echo rand(1, 100);\n97\nphp &gt; echo rand(1, 100);\n97\nphp &gt; echo rand(1, 100);\n39\nphp &gt; echo rand(1, 100);\n77\nphp &gt; echo rand(1, 100);\n93\nphp &gt; srand(1024);\nphp &gt; echo rand(1, 100);\n97\nphp &gt; echo rand(1, 100);\n97\nphp &gt; echo rand(1, 100);\n39\nphp &gt; echo rand(1, 100);\n77\nphp &gt; echo rand(1, 100);\n93\nphp &gt; \n</code></pre>\n<p>This isn't just some fluke.  Most PHP versions<sup>*</sup> on most platforms<sup>**</sup> will generate the sequence 97, 97, 39, 77, 93 when <code>srand</code>'d with 1024.</p>\n<p>To be clear, this isn't a problem with PHP, this is a problem with the implementation of <code>rand</code> itself.  The same problem appears in other languages that use the same (or a similar) implementation, including Perl.</p>\n<p>The trick is that any sane version of PHP will have pre-seeded <code>srand</code> with an &quot;unknown&quot; value.  Oh, but it isn't <em>really</em> unknown.  From <code>ext/standard/php_rand.h</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-c prettyprint-override\"><code>#define GENERATE_SEED() (((long) (time(0) * getpid())) ^ ((long) (1000000.0 * php_combined_lcg(TSRMLS_C))))\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, it's some math with <code>time()</code>, the PID, and the result of <code>php_combined_lcg</code>, which is defined in <code>ext/standard/lcg.c</code>.  I'm not going to c&amp;p here, as, well, my eyes glazed over and I decided to stop hunting.</p>\n<p>A bit of Googling shows that <a href=\"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Mar/519\" rel=\"noreferrer\">other areas of PHP don't have the best randomness generation properties</a>, and calls to <code>php_combined_lcg</code> stand out here, especially this bit of analysis:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not only does this function (<code>gettimeofday</code>) hand us back a precise server timestamp on a silver platter, it also adds in LCG output if we request &quot;more entropy&quot; (from PHP's <code>uniqid</code>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah <a href=\"http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.uniqid.php\" rel=\"noreferrer\">that <code>uniqid</code></a>.  It seems that the value of <code>php_combined_lcg</code> is what we see when we look at the resulting hex digits after calling <code>uniqid</code> with the second argument set to a true value.</p>\n<p>Now, where were we?</p>\n<p>Oh yes.  <code>srand</code>.</p>\n<p>So, if the code you're trying to predict random values from <em>doesn't</em> call <code>srand</code>, you're going to need to determine the value provided by <code>php_combined_lcg</code>, which you can get (indirectly?) through a call to <code>uniqid</code>.  With that value in hand, it's <em>feasible</em> to brute-force the rest of the value -- <code>time()</code>, the PID and some math.  The linked security issue is about breaking sessions, but the same technique would work here.  Again, from the article:</p>\n<blockquote>Here's a summary of the attack steps outlined above:\n<ul>\n<li>wait for the server to reboot</li>\n<li>fetch a uniqid value</li>\n<li>brute force the RNG seed from this</li>\n<li>poll the online status to wait for target to appear</li>\n<li>interleave status polls with uniqid polls to keep track of current server time and RNG value</li>\n<li>brute force session ID against server using the time and RNG value interval established in polling</li></ul></blockquote>\n<p>Just replace that last step as required.</p>\n<p>(This security issue was reported in an earlier PHP version (5.3.2) than we have currently (5.3.6), so it's possible that the behavior of <code>uniqid</code> and/or <code>php_combined_lcg</code> has changed, so this <em>specific</em> technique might not be workable any longer.  YMMV.)</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if the code you're trying to product <em>calls <code>srand</code> manually</em>, then unless they're using something many times better than the result of <code>php_combined_lcg</code>, you're probably going to have a much <em>easier</em> time guessing the value and seeding your local generator with the right number.  Most people that would manually call <code>srand</code> also wouldn't realize how horrible of an idea this is, and thus aren't likely to use better values.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that <code>mt_rand</code> is also afflicted by the same problem.  Seeding <code>mt_srand</code> with a known value will also produce predictable results.  Basing your entropy off of <code>openssl_random_pseudo_bytes</code> is probably a safer bet.</p>\n<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> For best results, don't seed the PHP random number generator, and for goodness' sake, don't expose <code>uniqid</code> to users.  Doing either or both of these may cause your random numbers to be more guessable.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Update for PHP 7:</h2>\n<p>PHP 7.0 introduces <a href=\"http://php.net/random_bytes\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>random_bytes</code></a> and <a href=\"http://php.net/random_int\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>random_int</code></a> as core functions.  They use the underlying system's CSPRNG implementation, making them free from the problems that a seeded random number generator has.  They're effectively similar to <code>openssl_random_pseudo_bytes</code>, only without needing an extension to be installed.  <a href=\"https://github.com/paragonie/random_compat\" rel=\"noreferrer\">A polyfill is available for PHP5</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>*: The <a href=\"http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Suhosin security patch</a> changes the behavior of <code>rand</code> and <code>mt_rand</code> such that they always re-seed with every call.  Suhosin is provided by a third party.  Some Linux distributions include it in their official PHP packages by default, while others make it an option, and others ignore it entirely.</p>\n<p>**: Depending on the platform and the underlying library calls being used, different sequences will be generated than documented here, but the results should still be repeatable unless the Suhosin patch is used.</p>\n"

First, edit the Discipline field:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lHE9C.png\" alt=\"Edit Discipline\"></p>\n\n<p>Then, click the Rules tab and edit the ALLOWEDVALUES rule:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1FfV1.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Then, Click \"New\", and add in \"Production\" as one of the values.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZcuoI.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Click \"OK\" repeatedly until you're back at the field list.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Save the Work Item Template</strong></p>\n\n<p>OK, now you're done. You can create new Bugs and indicate their type as Production. I'd also create a few Work Item Queries looking at Production defects, and add them to your pinned items. Finally, look at the existing Bug queries, and maybe change their ordering so that \"Production\" bugs come up first (if that's possible).</p>\n"

I've already declared that a is an A.  If I want to know the compile-time type of a, I only have to look in one place, at the declaration.  While I acknowledge that the implementation is relatively simple (use the code substitution you describe in your question), this also argues in favor of not implementing the feature; it's easy for coders to do it, too.</p>\n<p>The truly horrifying thing is that the type of a variable can magically change immediately after a <code>}</code>.  C# very deliberately prevents this from happening (see <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/ericlippert/simple-names-are-not-so-simple\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Simple names are not so simple</a>).  So, I absolutely hate any version of this feature that fails to introduce a new variable during the cast.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself constantly casting your types so as to access members of derived classes, it makes me suspect you are misusing inheritance.  Personally, usually in code where I'm using such a conditional, I'm going to break out of my function if the cast fails.  So, my code would look more like this:</p>\n<pre><code>B myB = myA as B;\nif (myB == null) return;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which would, under some variant of your proposal, become this:</p>\n<pre><code>if (!(myA is B)) return;\n</code></pre>\n<p>or (introducing a new name)</p>\n<pre><code>if (!(myA to B myB)) return;\n</code></pre>\n<p>or, using <a href=\"https://roslyn.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Language%20Feature%20Status&amp;referringTitle=Documentation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">declarative expressions</a> (this is a variant on <a href=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/236335/15162\">Jimmy Hoffa's answer</a>)</p>\n<pre><code>if (!a.To(out B myB)) return;\n</code></pre>\n<p>With the exception of the approach using declarative expressions, all of these features require learning new C# syntax for a feature that is not at all painful to deal with.  The declarative expression approach is nice in that it is the <a href=\"https://ericlippert.com/2012/07/17/should-c-warn-on-null-dereference/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">general case of a specific feature</a>; i.e. allowing coders to make use of an assignment and conditional using a single expression.</p>\n<p>The only cost to the declarative expression approach is that it won't work universally; it only works if your special <code>To</code> method is implemented and visible in your current scope.  However, that's a price I'm willing to pay to avoid adding yet more syntax to the C# language; I won't bother using such an extension method unless I'm dealing with code which constantly requires it (and probably not even then).</p>\n<p>In summary: This feature isn't needed quite often enough to justify adding new syntax to the language.  However, the more general feature, declarative expressions, may be worth the cost (which is why Microsoft is probably going to pay it).  It not only handles this case, but also handles the annoying two-statement <code>TryParse</code> case (and, like your proposal, makes for clean scope; the type is only in scope on the inside of the conditional).</p>\n<p><strong>Update: <a href=\"https://roslyn.codeplex.com/discussions/568820\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Declarative Expressions were cancelled</a>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Update 2: <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/whats-new-in-csharp-7-0/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">C# 7.0 is adding &quot;out variables&quot;</a>.</strong> This might be enough for my final example (<code>if (!a.To(out B myB)) return;</code>).  <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/whats-new-in-csharp-7-0/#user-content-is-expressions-with-patterns\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">C# 7.0 is also adding &quot;Is-expressions with patterns&quot;</a>, which allows, <code>if (!(o is int i)) return;</code>.

With some habit, you'll be very productive by using them together. And since your translation units will remain small (no more than a few thousand lines per source file), <strong>compilation is going fast today</strong> (less than a few seconds), unless you work on some <em>huge</em> free software project (like the GCC compiler, the Linux kernel, the Mozilla browser in C++, ...) of many millions of source code lines. But trying to contribute to huge project without any prior C experience is insane; so start with your own small C project (two dozens of thousands lines would require you a full year of work).</p>\n\n<p><sup>Since compilation is quick -typically less than a couple of seconds- you can afford compiling <em>very often</em> (e.g. several times each minute) and run your current test in the debugger; in rare cases -huge projects like GCC or the Linux kernel, compilation is much slower, but you won't be in that case without being very experimented in C coding, and then you'll have developed your own skills, tips and tricks to overcome the slowness of the build. So just be sure that your project is compiled quickly: use several translation units, so don't have source files bigger than a few thousand lines each, and master some builder (e.g. have a good <code>Makefile</code> for GNU <code>make</code>). Hence a REPL for C is practically useless, the compiler is fast enough ... Configure your editor, e.g. <code>emacs</code>, to be able to rebuild your program at a keystroke in a few seconds at most (perhaps with a parallel build, \u00e0 la <code>make -j</code>).</sup></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Notice that <strong>coding in C is hard</strong>, probably much harder than coding in Mathematica, not because of tools deficiency, but intrinsically because <strong>the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_%28computer_science%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">semantics</a> of C99 is difficult to master</strong> (notably, you'll need to understand precisely the potential <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">undefined behavior</a> and know how the computer works). Even with the right tools you'll spend days or weeks hunting some of your bugs; and it is not a matter of syntax (the syntax of C99 is relatively simple).</p>\n\n<p><sup>IMHO, it is the <em>semantics</em> of C99 which makes it hard to learn, and which makes REPL implementations of C rather useless. In practice, you won't be slowed by the compilation time (probably a second or two for you, if you are working on a fresh project), so you practically won't need any REPL. But you'll experiment that coding in C is difficult (but you'll learn a lot)</sup></p>\n"

                "content": " <p>The best way to prevent the race for a consultant is present a convincing business case that doesn't include a consultant.  From the business cases I've developed the main points are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Thoroughly define the problem being solved - Do not include your solution within the problem definition.  Concisely state the problem in business terms rather than technical terms.  For example \"Based on submitted bug reports customers find feature X confusing.  This confusion leads to frustration and reduces engagement in the overall product.\" is much better than \"The UI of feature X is flawed in these ways...\" because it states the problem in terms of business value.  In terms of solution ownership this shows that you understand the issue from a business perspective which is key since this is the same perspective that the decision makers will be looking from.  This will get everyone on the same page as to what the problem is from a high level.</li>\n<li>State your solution along with several other possible plans of\naction including the null case of doing nothing and state the\ncosts/benefits for each. For the above example I would go through\ndoing nothing, scrapping feature X, improving user training/help\ndocuments, reworking the UI on feature X.  This shows that you have\nlooked at the issue from several sides rather than immediately\nhopping onto your pet solution to the exclusion of all others.</li>\n<li>Show how you can effectively test if your solution eliminates the\nproblem.  This is huge in selling non-technical people on technical\nsolutions.  They want assurance that their investment is working so\nif you can give them concrete parameters and a way to measure\nsuccess.  If the definition of success is murky it is\npsychologically much harder to buy in to an idea.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My best real world example regarding going to a consultant is imagine you go to a mechanic for routine inspection.  If you hear \"Your garbles are cracked.  It's $800 to change them out.  Should I go ahead with that?\"  you are not going to be very confident in your ability to know if your money is being well spent and you may get a second opinion.  If you hear \"Your garbles are slightly cracked which could lead to your steering failing if you hit a pothole.  We could wait and see but that's risky.  I could weld across the crack for $500 but I wouldn't trust it long run.  It would be $800 to swap them out.  Swapping them out is the only way we can be sure they will hold.  What do you want me to do?\" you are going to feel more empowered to make a good decision even if the ultimate decision is the same.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note in a lot of places you are going to be fighting the culture to make headway on this.  Don't take it personally if the default answer is consultancy, just continue to work on your sales skills for selling your ideas to management.  When a decision goes against you on this remember that you may be missing pieces of the bigger picture (ie cost of failure may be higher than it generally appears due to interdependencies) or the opportunity cost for you doing this project rather than something else might be too high.</p>\n"

I have contacts that can cover my shift - feel free to contact me if that would be helpful.\"</p>\n\n<p>Don't bother explaining <em>why</em> you cannot cover the shift - your employer most likely does not care, they just care that they have to change their schedules. Offering practical help (such as help with finding a replacement) is always a good idea - no matter whether it is accepted or not.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A large part of which one's I decided to keep and which one's I cancel\n  on, is based on pay. Should I mention this or not (some did pay bellow\n  standard)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No - at least not in the mail noting that you cannot cover the shift. At that point, it does not matter, and at worst it could be seen as extortion tactics (\"pay me more, or I'll cancel on short notice\"). Everything has its place and time - and the time for discussing pay is when you are negotiating a new assignment, not when you are declining one.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I would like to keep on good terms with the agencies as possible as I\n  would like to find work with them in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By keeping it short and professional, and offering help with finding a replacement, you have done all that you can do. Maybe they will resent you for canceling a job, maybe not - but that's out of your hands, so don't worry about it.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As an aside - I just wanted to correct a common misunderstanding:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I don't want to say this is contract work as I never signed a\n  contract. As such, it is legal what I'm doing, but again I do feel bad\n  about cancelling on them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that (in most jurisdictions) <em>a contract does not need to be in writing</em>. If your boss says \"Do this work, we'll pay you X dollars\", and you say \"OK\", you have probably entered into a contract. So strictly speaking you <em>may</em> be in breach of your contract if you cancel a shift. Howver, that has little practical meaning because employers rarely bother to actually sue in such cases - but realize that from a purely legal point, they <em>could</em> do it in some cases (details vary according to specifics and jurisdiction, of course).</p>\n"

Effectively, if you participate on work-related (in my case, core Stack Overflow, Programmers and Workplace) and also non work-related (in my case, Genealogy &amp; Family History and the Arqade) sites, that's the equivalent of, say, having a technical blog and also a personal blog.

Instead, I'd look at it from the angle of whether or not you want any given question or answer to be linked to your main profile. For instance, we often see people creating new anonymous accounts to ask questions here on the Workplace because they don't want their questions about their workplace connected to their known profile. It's probably easier to do it case-by-case and use a fresh profile to ask a question if and when you need to.</p>\n"

Is it necessary to inform him that I no longer will be performing my responsibilities as outlined in our agreement?</em></p>\n\n<p>My co-founder 'Bob' and I have a Partnership Agreement to run a small online business - a Youtube channel along with a few social media accounts. His responsibilities were research and recording audio; mine were research, video production, and running the social media accounts. Our venture has not earned any money. Bob also was my long distance relationship boyfriend.</p>\n\n<p>Bob's contribution since the beginning of the venture has been up-and-down. There were a few weeks in which he would record as per the schedule we agreed upon, and then stop after a minor setback (ie. our videos did not receive views/comments). I would ask him from time to time to return to schedule, but he asked me to stop doing so. He did, however, buy a ~$30 microphone to record, of his own volition. He never stated that he no longer wanted to be business partners. I take responsibility for being too lax in negotiating.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I kept to the video production schedule, and I have updated (and continue to update) the social media accounts everyday.</p>\n\n<p>A few months ago Bob and I broke up amicably, but did not discuss what to do with the business. I continued updating the social media accounts during that time. After about a month or so to let the steam cool, I called Bob up to say that I was still interested in running the business and if he was interested in continuing our SOLELY business partnership. He indicated that he was interested in recording again.</p>\n\n<p>The next day I found out that Bob had blocked my personal lines of contact to him.</p>\n\n<p>I have not tried contacting him since then, but I have continued to update the social media accounts. I am no longer interested in doing so, and would like to know if it would be necessary to inform Bob, who is still in a Partnership Agreement with me, that I will no longer be performing my responsibilities as outlined in the agreement. He has not blocked the business's e-mail or social media accounts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> OP here. To clarify further, as this looks to be a point of confusion, Bob has not performed his responsibilities to the business since several weeks before we broke up. All in all, thank you everyone for your responses and advice.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

We were a small team of 3 people managing and developing the tools for our companies (we are the HQ). Almost 5 months ago, one of our colleagues left and since then I am having an increased number of tasks. Over these 2 years I have learned a lot and now I'm faster and more efficient at completing tasks and am able to tackle more complex matters too.</p>\n\n<h2>Salary history</h2>\n\n<p>This job was advertised as \"the minimum salary for this job is xx$\". And since before this job I've done a one year internship and it was the first \"real\" job plus the fact that it was matching perfectly with what I've done for one year and it also was what I wanted to continue with, I didn't try to negotiate this minimum offered salary out of fear of not getting the job. Fast forward 1 year later, I was waiting for the first employee appraisal in the hopes that I will be able to get a salary increase. Unfortunately, the management decided they want to change the direction in which the company is going and my boss was let go. Shortly after, we got a new boss and nobody had his appraisal that year from the department. Waited almost another year for the next appraisal, for which I have asked multiple times, over a time span of 2 months, and finally had the meeting and at the end of the meeting finally asked for a raise.</p>\n\n<p>Off-topic: The raise mentioned above is quite big in %, almost 30% but considering that even with that raise for my current experience I will be on par with the job market or even lower. I am not justifying my asked increase based on the fact that I've been doing this for over 2 years, but based on the market and what they would need to spend to replace me. I'd like to point out that I received a positive feedback in the appraisal and was told to keep up the good work.</p>\n\n<h2>Back to the salary negotiation</h2>\n\n<p>I didn't get a no from my boss for my asked raise, just that he needs to talk to HR. I was pretty happy back then because I thought that even if in the event in which I wasn't to going to get exactly what I asked for, I would be happy with even a slightly lower increase (20-25%). Now 3 months and a half passed and I have asked 4 times about the status of my request and stating that this is important to me not only due to the financial part but this would reflect how the company values me. Every time, I get more or less the same answer: still waiting for an answer from HR (my boss has a very important position in the company and probably he is not being honest as this salary increase should be very well in his power).</p>\n\n<h2>Notes:</h2>\n\n<p>This question is not about the %. As mentioned before, I didn't get a \"no\" for one second or a remark that it's too much.</p>\n\n<p>I love working here and I have spend a lot of time to learn the specifics of this company, I would like to do everything in my power to avoid leaving.</p>\n\n<p>The company is looking for months for someone to replace the colleague who left and they haven't been able to do it so far (mostly because with the set of skills asked, those people are already working as consultants and earning more). Note: the colleague which left the company, left for the same reason: asked for a raise and he got a \"no\". But at least he got an answer pretty fast...</p>\n\n<h2>Question</h2>\n\n<p>How should I continue from here? Should I try to be more pushy and ask again if he's (boss) happy with my performance and if the answer is \"yes\" then go ahead and ask firmly to have my situation finalized. Is it normal that it takes this long for an answer, or this would show a complete lack of interest for the employee? My goal is to at least get a \"no\" or a \"yes\", tired of waiting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Probably not a duplicate of \"How to approach my boss if I'm feeling underpaid\". I have already read that even before I had my first negotiation and followed the advices there to discus about my achievements and why I should I be getting a raise. Now it's a matter of done that and <strong>now what</strong>?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit nr. 2</strong>: Since I can't add a comment to Joe's answer due to the low reputation, I'll type additional info here. First of all, thank you Joe, long time reader of your answers here. My boss talked to HR for sure at least once, because there was also the discussion if they should change my contract type to have more hours included, to that HR sent back quite fast a \"no\" because I am not above a certain trigger that they are having. I know that they can't afford losing another team member because due to the specifics of the job, it takes 6 months to 1 year to get familiarized with all the custom tools and how they are built (can be faster for a fast learner). Now, I don't know why would HR drag this, the only reason I could think of, is they are first looking for a replacement for my colleague and once they have that they will say \"no\" to me.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

Take this as an opportunity to impress your new employers. People with a reputation for finishing work ahead of time are valuable - and in software, very rare. Let your manager know that you're free and ready to be assigned your next task.</p>\n\n<p>Alternately you may want to see if you can set up a system where you can \"pull\" work, rather than have your manager \"push\" it to you. To start with you can make sure that your manager keeps your to-do list sufficiently long that you never run out, but eventually you might want to influence the working procedures of your workplace towards a more agile approach (where your <em>team</em> has a to-do list, and you grab the item at the top when you're free).</p>\n\n<h2>Find ways to generate value yourself</h2>\n\n<p>If you think your manager will just give you make-work to get you out of their hair, or if you don't like the sound of asking for more, then why don't you look for some ways you can generate value for the company yourself? See if you can automate a build or a deployment. Introduce a tool to automatically enforce a policy usually checked by hand. There are usually thousands of things that could get done that we never get around to.</p>\n\n<p>Use your judgement, though. You're likely to want to clear this kind of thing with your manager anyway.</p>\n\n<h2>Improve your skills</h2>\n\n<p>Read a book, explore an API, dig into the source control logs of an open-source component your project uses.</p>\n\n<p>Learn about the domain you're working in. Are there any useful documents on your intranet? Regulations that it would be useful for you to understand?</p>\n\n<p>Good employers will appreciate your initiative, though you may wish to exercise caution before indulging yourself excessively.</p>\n"

Last year, we hired two more entry level devs.  I have no management experience or training and very few managerial duties, but by virtue of my seniority I am in a position of some authority and on paper they report to me.  Point is, calling me a terrible manager is not helpful.  I expect I am, but I want to know how to improve.</p>\n\n<p>We have a morning meeting where my team is expected to report to me their progress the past day and set goals for the new day.  I can then report to the boss (owner) what the team is up to.  The boss has repeatedly pushed to set an 8 am start for the work day, but this was unpopular and I have been able to hold our meetings to 10 am instead.  The meeting is consistently punctual.  If I call the meeting at 10:01 I consider myself late.  This is important to me since I feel that if I don't respect my own schedule why should the team?</p>\n\n<p>Lately (over the past few months), one of our team members has been consistently showing up for work later and later.  I didn't say anything since I don't want to send the message that obeying some clock is more important than getting your work done, and the employee has been consistently putting in his 40 hours a week (I can verify this, since we are required to punch a time clock).  My gut says that the quality of his work has suffered, but I do not have solid objective evidence of that.</p>\n\n<p>It has become a bit of a problem now though because he is showing up late for the morning meetings.  Once last week and now two days in a row last week.  I have asked him if there is anything going on or if he needs any sort of accommodation from the company.  He said no, that he was sorry and that he would try to be on time.   This was a couple weeks ago and he has not improved.  I have asked the other dev if he knows anything and he says he does not.</p>\n\n<p>At this point I do not feel that pushing the meeting back further will help.  All of us were able to make the 8:00 - 8:30 start time when the boss was breathing down our necks about it.  He knows it, we know it.  I am concerned that if I do not come up with a solution the boss will re-impose stricter rules and my team will lose some of the flexibility that we now enjoy.

Nobody can leave until it has been held. Schedule it for [length-of-meeting] minutes before whenever a 40-hour-a-week person would leave if they came in at 8. (If such a person would leave at 4, hold it at 3:45.]</p>\n\n<p>Now you can all talk about what you did today, and what you will continue to do if you're not leaving yet, and what you'll be doing first thing tomorrow before LateGuy is in. You can cover all the same bases as a morning meeting but without having to wait for LateGuy. What's more, the early people can take action at 8am if they learn from LateGuy that such action needs to be taken. </p>\n\n<p>If you do this, he is now free to have his flex time (within reason - he can't work 8pm to 4am or you wouldn't be able to have a meeting.) Perhaps with the tension removed, his productivity and quality will go back to where they were. Perhaps he'll start coming in at 11, or noon, or 3, and you'll have to drill more deeply into what is happening and how the company feels about it. But more likely he will arrive roughly between 9:30 and 10:30 most days, and get to work, and you'll be fine.</p>\n\n<p>If it turns out that end-of-day meetings just don't work and you and the other on-time arriver are suffering with an end of day meeting, then you have to tell him that he must regularize his hours enough that there is a time in the morning (and not 11:59 either) when you can be sure he will be in so that a morning meeting can be held. Get his agreement on a time and then if you must, get the boss to make it clear that being in by that time is a condition of employment. But don't go there until you've given end of day meetings a fair try. That should increase the chances he'll agree to a reasonable schedule for beginning of day ones if they're vital.</p>\n\n<p>(By the way, my guess is that he's recently started an evening activity -- online gaming, or a new significant other, or square dancing -- and is staying up later and later every night in some semi-addictive spiral, then having a harder and harder time getting up in the morning. His tiredness is causing the quality lapse, and he resists your actions because he tells himself that he will stop earlier tonight and not have a problem any more. If this is what's happening he may spiral himself right out of a job, or the initial excitement may wear off and he may go back to a more normal rhythm. But you can't manage assuming this is the case, hence my suggestion for a reasonable rearrangement, at least as an experiment.)</p>\n"

I've been daydreaming about what the hiring process might be like, when there's only me in the beginning.

Also for the first week the candidate could be fired at any moment, this might create a threatening atmosphere.

                "content": " <p>Most good programmers are already employed.  They're taking vacation time, realistically, to come to the interview.  You'd be asking them to take another vacation day to work with you (unless you plan on them doing their time-limited tasks after they put in a full day at their current employer).  Then you'd be asking them to take a week of vacation to work with you for a week which likely also takes some time to arrange.  And only then, after burning through a large chunk of their vacation hours, you would potentially offer them a probationary contract that would allow them to consider giving two weeks notice at their current employer.  That certainly reduces your risk of hiring someone that isn't going to be productive but it means that the candidate is taking a tremendous risk.  </p>\n\n<p>Of course, it creates a number of risks for you.  There is some intellectual property risk.  Depending on the candidate's current employment agreement, you might find that their current employer has rights to the code that they write for you.  There is a timing risk.  You're going to have to wait for them to arrange a vacation day and then to arrange a vacation week and then to put in their notice before they can stat their probationary contract.  That's a fair amount of waiting and coordinating.  If you're a slow-moving Fortune 500, that might not be a huge issue.  If you're a fast-moving startup, an interview process that stretches over a month or two would be problematic.</p>\n\n<p>If you decide that you'll only hire folks that are currently unemployed, which will severely restrict the pool of solid candidates, then you just have the logistical problems.  Getting a new employee set up is a fair amount of work particularly when you're going to measure their first day output and can't afford a hiccup when something doesn't work smoothly.  And there is a lot of employment paperwork that needs to happen to make sure that you do the proper witholding, send out the proper tax forms at the end of the year, you've got the appropriate NDAs an the like.  From the employee standpoint, the extra work involved in doing a single day of contract work may well cost them more in tax preparation fees than they'd make.  And that may interfere with their unemployment benefits.</p>\n\n<p>And unless you are doing something terribly repetitive and uninteresting, expecting someone to deliver a lot of value in a single day or a single week is probably optimistic.  People take time to come up to speed on an existing code base, understand your architecture, get their environment set up for maximum productivity, etc.  If you're just asking them to make small tweaks in very localized pieces of code based on fully developed specs, that might be enough time.  But that won't tell you a whole lot about their ability to do the more involved tasks that you're likely hiring them for.</p>\n"
