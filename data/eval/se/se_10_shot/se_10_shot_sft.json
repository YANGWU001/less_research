Here is how I think it should have been done.</p>\n<p><strong>Assume that they know nothing about academic work.</strong> You can even tell them that, if you do it in a nice way, they will understand that you are simply take care that they know the basics. Unless their Bachelor/Masters program specificaly teaches how to work in academia, they will have absolutely no idea. At our university only psychology students actually understand the scientific method, and only molecular medicine/biochem students are prepared to work in their respective fields. The rest learns facts and math. What I mean by that specifically is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They do not know how a paper is structured and why it is done the way it is in your field. What belongs in the introduction? What belongs in the discussion? Andy why? Etc. Take a good paper, and go through it. Then take a couple of bad ones (maybe student submissions), and make them point out mistakes to them.</li>\n<li>How do you find a research idea? (Relevant only after the first project)</li>\n<li>How do you actually research a question? Some might never have used google scholar, and do not even know that you can look up &quot;cited by&quot;. Why should you always try searching for a review? How do you stay up to date in a field? What are the top journals/people to pay attention to?</li>\n<li>What tools are there? They might be obvious to you, but they are not to them. Google Scholar, Connected Papers, Zotero with all Plugins, etc. Whatever you use, show them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, to start them off, give them a clear project, with a clear goal. They have no idea what is relevant in the field, and neither should they. A review of a very narrow field might be a great place to start.</p>\n<p>My personal preference: Allow them to send you rough drafts. My prof wanted to see an almost polished version of everything, which meant that I wasted so much time ...</p>\n<p>Once they wrote the first paper, they probably should be able to come up with original ideas and be very productive, and you will not need to guide them, but will be instead working as peers.</p>\n<p>Make sure they are not afraid to come to you with ideas. If they have a very stupid one, explain why it is not feasible, instead of dismissing it. Never use your taste/experience as a reason to dismiss something without a good explanation. If they are afraid to come to you with ideas, they will not be having fun, and you will not be happy, trust me. This also goes for teaching. If they want to try a new method, either explain why you think it is not feasible, or just let them try it, and maybe crash and burn.</p>\n"

The forces you are trying to fight are so much bigger and more powerful than you, that unless you are willing to dedicate your entire life to fighting them, knowing that you will achieve either nothing or very little, your only other choice would be to keep your head down, either ignore or join in the cheating, and resign yourself to a life of dissatisfaction and unfulfilled dreams.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry it's pessimistic and depressing, but there it is.

If so, the difference may be due to space used for <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4878\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\"local snapshots\"</a> (essentially, backups to the local disk when your real backup disk is not available). Local snapshots are automatically deleted when the space is needed for something else (actually, it starts purging them when the volume reaches 80% full), so the Finder treats them as free space. <code>du</code>, on the other hand, sees them as used space (as do Disk Utility and System Information).</p>\n\n<p>To find out if this is what's going on, take a look in System Information: From the Apple Menu, choose \"About This Mac\", then click \"More Info\", then select the Storage tab, and look for a light purple (\"Backups\") band on the usage chart. If it's around 47GB, this is the source of the difference.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to disable this feature, you can use the Terminal command <code>sudo tmutil disablelocal</code> -- but I recommend leaving it enabled, as it does provide some useful protection against accidental deletion/file damage/etc when your real backup is not available.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: As @chillin pointed out, there's an additional source of confusion: <code>df</code> and the Finder are using different units to report the sizes. <code>df</code> is using Gibibytes (=1,073,741,824 bytes), while the Finder is using Gigabytes (=1,000,000,000 bytes). If the Finder had reported in GiB, it would've said Capacity: 232.96 GiB, Available: 166.41 GiB, Used: 66.55 GiB. So there was actually about 52 GiB used for the local snapshots.</p>\n"

Of particular concern to us here, genitive pronouns and other genitive noun phrases can appear in Determiner function:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><p>[my] dinosaur - <sup><em>genitive pronoun</em></sup></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>[that man's] dinosaur - <sup><em>genitive noun phrase</em></sup></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now the pertinent rule relating to the original poster's question is that standard English will only allow one Determiner in any given noun phrase. Examples (5\u20148) below are therefore ungrammatical:</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>*the my dinosaur</li>\n<li>*any her dinosaurs</li>\n<li>*no those people</li>\n<li>*a John's friend</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>The Original Poster's Question</strong></p>\n<p>The Original Poster's noun phrase was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(9) Kukhtarev's model</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here we see the genitive noun phrase (NP) <em>Kukhtarev's</em> in Determiner fnction within the larger NP. This is exactly analagous to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(10) John's car</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now it is possible that the supervisor was aiming to change this to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(11) the [Kukhtarev model]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here, in (11), the word <em>the</em> is in Determiner function and <em>Kukhtarev</em> in contrast appears a modifier within the Head of the larger NP. The three possibilities here are that the supervisor did not notice the <em><strong>'s</strong></em>,  that the supervisor made an incomplete edit and failed to delete the <em><strong>'s</strong></em>, or that the supervisor's knowledge of English is incomplete. We cannot know. In any case the resulting string after the edit is categorically ungrammatical because it has two Determiners in the one NP:</p>\n<ol start=\"12\">\n<li>*[the] [Kukhtarev's] model</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Likewise so is the following:</p>\n<ol start=\"13\">\n<li>*[the] [John's] car</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If we wanted to use both a definite article and a genitive noun phrase we could use an oblique genitive construction to correct these:</p>\n<ol start=\"14\">\n<li>the model of Kukhtarev's ...</li>\n<li>the car of Johns' ...</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lastly, to avoid confusion, and before anyone asks, there is one situation where we might see the word <em>the</em> followed by a word like <em>Johns'</em> or <em>Smiths'</em>. This is where the Determiner is a plural genitive noun phrase:</p>\n<ol start=\"16\">\n<li>[[the] Smiths'] car</li>\n<li>[[the] Johns'] car</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In (16\u201417), the word <em>the</em> is not a Determiner within the larger noun phrase. Rather it appears within the smaller Determiner noun phrase as shown. In (16) we might be talking about a car belonging to Mr &amp; Mrs Smith and similarly for (17) a car belonging to Mr &amp; Mrs John. We can't use a definite article when we refer to a singular person using a proper noun like this. The reason is that we don't use articles when using a singular referential proper noun:</p>\n<ol start=\"18\">\n<li>*The John punched me  - <em>ungrammatical</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If the word <em>John</em> were not a name, but a common noun, for example the venacular for a toilet, or a prositute's client (as mentioned by @Weather Vane), then  there would be no problem with noun phrases like the following:</p>\n<ol start=\"19\">\n<li>[[The] john's] door was wide open.</li>\n<li>[[The] john's] car was parked outside.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In conclusion: the Original Poster needs to stick to their guns.</p>\n"

The market is <em>on a tear</em>! \u2013 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And, Google Ngram shows that the usages of both \u2018on a tear\u2019 and \u2018in a tear\u2019 have been observed since early before 1840. The incidences of \u2018on a tear\u2019 is on rise from 0.000001 in 1970 to 0.0000025 after 2000 and onward, but incidences of 'in a tear' have been flattened out at the low level of 0.0000012 - 0.0000016 throughout the tracked period. </p>\n\n<p>Now here are my questions: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What is the plain and exact meaning of \u2018on (in) a tear\u2019 in the context of the above quote?</li>\n<li>Is \u2018on (in) a tear\u2019 a popular idiom?</li>\n<li>Why none of major English dictionaries such as CED, OED, OALED, MWED accommodates this phrase as an idiom in spite of a long presence of the phrase as shown in Google NGram?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Barrons\u2019 magazine seems to be fond of using \"on a tear.\"  It repeated this phrase again in its June 19 news-report (through AFN radio broadcast) reporting a marked improvement of U.S.'s largest closeout chain, Big Lots\u2019 sales performance.

A pn junction in the simplest sense is a collection of static positive charges on one side and a collection of static negative charges on the other side.

You probably know from your linear algebra classes how to act on a vector $\\ket \\psi$. Well it is just $H \\ket \\psi = \\ket \\varphi$, which is of course another vector in your vector space, which I have called $\\ket \\varphi$. Now you probably also know, how $H^2$ acts on a vector; namely you just act with the operator $H$ twice:</p>\n\n<p>$$H^2 \\ket \\psi = H (H \\ket \\psi) = H \\ket \\varphi =  \\ket \\chi$$</p>\n\n<p>where I defined the vector $\\ket \\chi := H \\ket \\varphi $</p>\n\n<p>By induction, you also know how $H^n$ acts for $n \\in \\mathbb N$. </p>\n\n<p>Remember also that you are in a vector space that is you can add two vectors, and in particular two linear operators. For example, let's look at the operator $H^2+H$:</p>\n\n<p>$$ (H^2+H) \\ket \\psi = H^2 \\ket \\psi + H \\ket \\psi = \\ket \\chi + \\ket \\varphi   $$</p>\n\n<p>Again by induction you know for a polynomial $p(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k x^k$, where $a_k \\in \\mathbb C$ some constant coefficients, how the operator $p(H)$ acts on states:</p>\n\n<p>$$ p(H) \\ket \\psi = \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k (H^k \\ket \\psi) $$</p>\n\n<p>Without worrying too much about convergence issues (we are physicists (!)), we can define the exponential map of an operator:</p>\n\n<p>$$  \\exp(H) = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb N} \\frac{1}{n!} \\, H^n \\implies \\exp(H) \\ket \\psi = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb N} \\frac{1}{n!} \\, (H^n  \\ket \\psi) $$</p>\n\n<p>The upshot is that you have to <em>define</em> the exponential of an operator and there is no way around it. There is however a special case, when for example you have an eigenvector of the operator. Let's assume that the vector $\\ket E$ is an eigenvector of $H$ with eigenvalue $E$ i.e. $H \\ket E = E \\ket E$, then we have:</p>\n\n<p>$$ \\exp(H) \\ket E =  \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb N} \\frac{1}{n!} \\, (H^n  \\ket E ) =  \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb N} \\frac{E^n}{n!}\\ket E  = \\exp(E)\\ket E$$</p>\n\n<p>In analogy, you can convince yourself that if you can write a function $f$ in taylor series and if $\\ket E$ is an eigenvector of $H$ as above then we have $f(H) \\ket E = f(E) \\ket E $.</p>\n\n<p>I hope that this helps you understand the exponential of an operator.

The <code>Set-Cookie</code> header will only be sent once, so if there are two browsers logged into the same session, one of them will be using the old, invalid session. You could have a small overlap where both sessions are valid to avoid problems with requests for resources that the browser has yet to request (e.g. an AJAX request that has just been sent awaiting a connection, while the server has responded with a new ID to the main page request). This gives a good balance of usability whilst fulfilling your single session requirement as the browser that does not receive the new cookie will be logged out.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to do this is to go for a stricter method, as employed by some banks. Rather than store the Session ID in a cookie, it is stored in the page itself. This also ensures that the user follows a set route through your site and cannot jump to pages out of sequence. The way this works is that there is a hidden field within the page and each navigation action is a HTTP POST to the next page. e.g. you could have a single handler at <code>https://www.example.com/loggedInAction</code> and each form POSTs to that:-</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;form method=\"post\" action=\"https://www.example.com/loggedInAction\"&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"requestId\" value=\"123456\" /&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"action\" value=\"navigateToMyAccountPage\" /&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The idea here is that the Request ID is regenerated after each navigation action, and the server uses this Request ID to keep track of each session. Session sharing is not possible as the ID is stored in the form rather than the cookie, although it can be combined with a cookie if you wish to keep session ID and the request ID separate. If another user did copy the request ID and edit their request, only the first user could continue as each Request ID is expired once used. This approach will also prevent use of the back button on the site, and it is really an approach that needs to be designed into the system from the start.</p>\n"

I have seen it be handled in two different ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The CA simply won't issue certs that outlive itself. Say you have a CA that issues 1-year certs. When the CA itself has less than a year on it they will stand up a new issuing CA.

This is a bit hacky because there is technically an expired CA in the chain. Most TLS engines do not support this kind of thing, so I have only seen it in closed environments like corporate email or ID badge systems where you have more control over the clients.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Because of the disruption of rolling over a root CA, you want it to be valid for a long time.

Encryption, digital signature, decryption, and signature verification are all done at the <em>endpoints</em> by the <em>client software</em>.  The intervening e-mail servers and service providers have nothing to do with this, as the messages get passed along just like any other.  Further, and perhaps most importantly, S/MIME must be supported by both the <em>sending and receiving clients</em> in order to work.  This is beyond the ability of any single e-mail provider to ensure.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, I'm not aware of any common freemail provider (i.e.: GMail, Yahoo, Hotmail) that is currently facilitating S/MIME in their browser-based clients.  Certainly none of them are, nor would they want to be, enabling it as a default.</p>\n\n<p>The reason this cannot work at the service provider level is because of the requirement for both endpoint clients to support the protocol.  Since the service provider of the sender has no control over the client software used by the recipient, enforcing S/MIME use on outbound messages would result in many (if not most) recipients not being able to read the sender's e-mails.</p>\n\n<p>The only conditions under which S/MIME will work are when all participants in the e-mail conversation have S/MIME-compatible clients, and everyone has (and has verified) each others' public keys.  Again, this is not something that any individual e-mail service provider can effect.  They may conceivably be able to facilitate this between their own users, but they do not have the same power to protect e-mails going to/from external endpoints.</p>\n\n<p>SSL/TLS are technologies commonly used to secure communications between clients and servers and from server-to-server.  However, here we again run into a similar situation as with S/MIME - both parties to the conversation must support it.  While some service providers may do this, no service provider can guarantee you that SSL/TLS will be applied to every message you send because they do not have control over what the receiving server is configured to support.</p>\n\n<p>To address your concerns more concisely, point-by-point:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>None of the above use S/MIME.  While it would be a nice feature for them to support in their web clients, it would be infeasible for them to guarantee that it will work for all recipients.  You can get around this to some degree by using your own e-mail client with S/MIME support, instead of using the web interfaces.  However, again, this will only work where you have coordinated this with your intended recipients.</p></li>\n<li><p>SSL/TLS is commonly used to protect the web sessions by which e-mails are composed, and the client connections by which they are sent.  It's also used to protect server-to-server communications along the way, but no service provider can guarantee that every recipient's e-mail servers or client will support and maintain that protection along the way.</p></li>\n<li><p>Many providers do use SSL/TLS, but you should check with yours yourself if you're concerned.  Again, though, this cannot guarantee that your e-mail is protected through transmission and storage every step along the way to every recipient.</p></li>\n<li><p>Any time you are sending/receiving e-mail which is not protected by S/MIME, PGP, or a similar end-to-end encryption solution, you must assume that the message has been transmitted or stored in the clear, or in another form readable by a third-party, <em>somewhere</em>.  </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The last point touches on an issue I've not yet addressed - e-mail storage on the server.  All e-mail service providers, by the nature of their service, must store e-mails exactly as they were received or by using some form of encryption that they themselves can reverse.  Otherwise, they will not be able to forward the e-mail on in a readable format to others or display it to you in your web browser.  If you're not using end-to-end encryption, that means your e-mail is being effectively stored in the clear.  This leaves it vulnerable to malicious insiders, or anyone who manages to hack into your e-mail account or the server's database.</p>\n"

I understand the basic implications of the principle, but I wonder if using the halting problem isn't a convenient excuse to justify the dismal state of cybersecurity? What applicability does the halting problem actually have to cybersecurity applications, such as malware detection or vulnerability detection?</p>\n\n<p>The way I see it, the halting problem states that it's not possible to write a general purpose program which can make 100% accurate determinations about the behavior of every single possible program. I'm thinking of a program that analyzes software to determine if it's malicious, or a program that analyzes software to determine if it contains buffer overflow or SQLi vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n<p>The proof relies on a special, contrived program to show this paradox. This doesn't mean that <em>no programs</em> can be analyzed by another program with 100% accuracy, nor even that a large majority of real-world programs can't be reliably analyzed by another program with 100% accuracy.</p>\n\n<p>My final question is can an attacker use the halting problem as a form of an attack? E.g. whatever analysis program you have written to detect the attacker's presence or activity, can the attack write a program with the same provable behavior of making your detection algorithm undecidable?</p>\n\n<p>Any pointers to real-world research or established experts on this subject is much appreciated.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

Allow me to answer, then.</p>\n\n<p>The \"halting problem\" is indeed an illustration of the impossibility to decide (for a computer) whether a given program will halt or not. Of course, a lot of programs are decidable, but not all of them. People tend to think that if we could accurately \"predict the behaviour\" of computer programs, then malware would not be possible. This is oversimplistic, for the following reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The \"halting problem\" is about deciding whether a computer program will stop, <em>for a given input</em> which is known <em>a priori</em>. This model works only about programs which are pure calculation, and do no I/O. By definition, this does not apply to any application which is connected to the Internet or can be controlled by a human. As an illustration, consider an application which runs a video. This one will never stop as long as the human user clicks on the rewind button. But it may stop (and it should be easy to prove) if the user does <em>not</em> click on any button.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability_%28logic%29\">Decidability</a> is about whether a given function can be evaluated <em>at all</em>, but not whether it can be evaluated <em>efficiently</em>. If you want an antivirus to scan for malware, you want the answer within 2 or 3 seconds -- not in ten years. This notion of decidability does not capture all the things in which we are interested.</p></li>\n<li><p>We <em>can</em> have requirements. Consider a Java application. It is written in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode\">bytecode</a> which is amenable to (efficient) automatic proofs. Namely, the JVM will <em>prove</em>, in a very formal way, that the code complies to the type rules of Java (that it never calls a method on a class which does not feature that method). It is not possible to make such a proof generically, on every possible sequence of bytecode instructions; but <em>valid Java code</em> is bytecode which <em>can</em> be proven in such a way. This means that it is possible in practice to enforce requirements of \"proofability\" for existing code. In a \"halting problem\" point of view, this would be like stating that programs for which the halting behaviour cannot be determined absolutely (and quickly) will be unceremoniously prevented from execution.</p></li>\n<li><p>We are not interested in whether a program will <em>halt</em>, but whether a program will do <em>evil things</em>. I am all for a computer to alter my bank account... as long as that is what I want. The difference between me, the human/ursine user, managing my money through the bank's Web site, and a malware, siphoning my precious gold through the bank's Web site, is not something which exists in the world of computers. There is no notion of Evil in computers. If I want security, I must first define with all the needed precision what exactly I want to allow computers to do, and what I don't want. Before asking myself whether a computer program will be able to automatically decide if my core security properties will be respected by a given piece of code, I must first <em>define</em> these properties, and that initial part of the work is far from being done. Making computers guess what is Good is an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM\">old problem</a> which seems hard.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For these reasons, I claim that invoking the \"halting problem\" is a poor excuse. It does highlight the fact that we are dealing with issues which require a bit more thinking than writing yet another PHP Web site. But it does <strong>not</strong> imply that security is not possible, only that Science will not come up with a magical tool which will solve it effortlessly (because this Blessed +3 Hammer of Decidability would also solve the halting problem, which is not mathematically possible).</p>\n"

This means that most work will be done on a\nsingle row).</li>\n<li>Each customer who uses this software will require amendments,\nadditional columns/fields or changes in column names and maybe\nbusiness logic. Each customer may require updates which change the\ndatabase structure. The idea is that anything that can be customized, any\nclient specific requirements will live within these classes.</li>\n<li>There will be reporting, mainly involving pulling records matching\nparticular categories, word searches, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have the database schema done and laid out, and the logic of how tables\nrelate is clear.  I have used this very schema in another framework, but a web based app doesn't seem to offer the level of power to the user with regards to the GUI, which is essential to differentiate this product from the others.</p>\n\n<p>My question is how to design classes around the database. It is important to\nget this right, so that the architecture of the software doesn't have to be\nredesigned later on. The classes will not be responsible for the persistent\nstore, only for acting as an intermediary between the layer responsible for\nthe persistent store and the controllers/views.</p>\n\n<p>The most logical approach appears to be to have a class for non-conformances/complaints etc, which solely store the instance (ie, one object per non-conformance record), validate data and class specific business logic (ie, computations).  One class per table seems logical in this case.  What I'm struggling with, is whether it is standard practice to simply have data members for each column, define getters and setters, or whether I should create a class which isn't hard-coded to map to a table, but which populates a map based on the database schema or external file which defines the database and column properties. The former means that the coding for the class needs to be changed when columns are modified, the latter potentially not.  Keep in mind, for the majority of the time, each user will be working with one record at at time.</p>\n\n<p>In short, I can see example of how to do SQL queries, but I've struggled to\nfind anything which shows me what the class should look like (or if this entire approach is wrong) and I'd like to compare what I'm doing, with what the industry would define as good practice (I'm not a programmer by trade).</p>\n\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

In the client I have created this hierarchy:</p>\n\n<pre><code>abstract class Vehicle\n    String name;\n\nabstract class Car extends Vehicle\n\nabstract class Truck extends Vehicle\n\ninterface Hybrid\n    boolean isInHybridMode()    \n\nclass Prius extends Car, implements Hybrid\n\nclass Camaro extends Car\n\nclass F150 extends Truck\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've chosen to make <code>Hybrid</code> an interface so that the inheritance structure is not crazy (and super messy if ever got a hybrid truck).</p>\n\n<p>The client can easily create these vehicles from the server output (let's say JSON). I just check the <code>type</code> field and create the appropriate concrete class.</p>\n\n<pre><code>[\n   {\n      \"name\":\"bob's car\",\n      \"type\":\"Prius\",\n      \"inHybridMode\":true\n   },\n   {\n      \"name\":\"joe's car\",\n      \"type\":\"Camaro\"\n   }\n]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My question is, how can I handle the situation where the server returns me a vehicle that I don't (yet) have a concrete class for?</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n   \"name\":\"alice's car\",\n   \"type\":\"Camry\",\n   \"inHybridMode\":true\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My options are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Completely ignore this type and don't create an object. This will cause problems when I try to do <code>vehicles.size()</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make <code>Vehicle</code> (and <code>Car</code> and <code>Truck</code>) non-abstract and just create a <code>Vehicle</code> object with corresponding <code>name</code> field</p></li>\n<li><p>Create a new class called <code>UnknownHybrid extends Car, implements Hybrid</code>. This will act as a catch-all for any vehicle that is of unknown type and has <code>inHybridMode</code> field.</p></li>\n<li><p>Crash horribly, forcing me to implement a <code>Camry</code> class.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I like #3 now while this problem is simple, but I don't want to create catch-alls for every combination of interfaces that I later create.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>UPDATE:</p>\n\n<p>First, thanks for all of the great responses.</p>\n\n<p>In an attempt to simplify my problem for question-asking I left some things out that you identified. I'll answer those questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I actually have <code>type</code> and <code>model</code>. Type is either Car or Truck, only. Camry, Camaro, F150, etc. is the model.</p></li>\n<li><p>I only need Car, Truck, and Hybrid behavior. There is no such thing as Camry behavior, only in that it is Car + Hybrid behavior. </p>\n\n<p>I added the model classes (Camry, F150, etc.) so that I'd have a class which could implement <code>Hybrid</code> interface. I <em>think</em> I'll have fewer models than combinations of interfaces. Eventually I'll have other \"mix in\" behavior like <code>Convertible</code>, <code>4WD</code>, etc. So I thought I'd just create classes for each model instead of each combination of interface (HybridConvertibleCar, etc.)</p></li>\n<li><p>As for business requirements: display info about Car, display info about Truck, display green indicator when in Hybrid mode, handle unknown models that may or may not be hybrid, convertible, 4wd. </p>\n\n<p>The thing I'm trying to avoid (and the current implementation) is that all of the behavior for hybrid, convertible, 4wd is all contained in the <code>Vehicle</code> class. So I have a lot of models that have fields/methods that don't pertain to them. For example Truck has an <code>isConvertibleTopDown</code> method that always returns \"false\". </p></li>\n<li><p>There is more to <code>Hybrid</code> than just isInHybridMode. I just removed most of it for the sake of the question.</p></li>\n<li><p>If all I had was <code>Vehicle</code> I'd just display vehicle-specific data (e.g. <code>name</code>).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\nAssistant:"

You shove Camry data into a <code>Car</code> datatype because you want <code>Car</code> behavior with this data.

It would be premature to start making plans as though your departure were definite, while simultaneously doing damage to your position at the company, which is what you would be doing if you turned down training. For all you know your company may value you enough that they will better any offer a rival makes for you.</p>\n\n<p>I would say nothing, and only start to talk about the training when you have a definite job offer. If it hasn't happened, they can pick someone to replace you at it. if it has, then that's just the way the cookie crumbles. The training will probably be useful to you in your future job.</p>\n\n<p>Frankly, $2K of training isn't actually a big cost to the company compared with all the other expenses they will have when you leave, things like advertising and recruiting your replacement, training your replacement in things you already know about, lost productivity while your replacement comes up to speed. They probably won't worry about it, and neither should you.</p>\n"

Their theory being \"they're paid to work in that area, so they must be experts\"...</p>\n\n<p>In each case, I've already presented my understanding of the problem and my proposed solution. Each and every time, the consultants produce a report that supports my conclusions (but often goes into less detail - as I've had the advantage of examining the original issue over more time).</p>\n\n<p>Then, what usually happens is that I've gained some \"business credibility\" in subject \"A\", but if a problem ever occurs with topic \"B\" it'll be the same uphill battle all over again.</p>\n\n<p>I've also seen attitudes resembling:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"We don't know, so you can't know.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If they've had an issue for months or years, then you join and suggest something they haven't tried, there's almost a willful refusal to consider the possibility.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The consultants are employed by the vendor/OEM, so they must know.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even when it's a relatively trivial issue, they'll assume they need an oracle on the subject (thinking along the lines of \"we have a Java issue, James Gosling must be the only person able to help us\").</p>\n\n<p>Now, I'd hope that I have a reasonably realistic assessment of my own abilities (or lack thereof), so when there's a problem outside of my \"domain\" I'll just do everything possible to stay out of the way and absorb the knowledge demonstrated by whoever gets tasked with resolving it (basically, I don't pretend to know what I don't know about). </p>\n\n<p><strong>How can I convince my employer that I have the level of competence they require when it's in an area where they lack the expertise to assess competence?</strong> </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>A few people commenting and answering have missed a nuance to my question. The people I'm working with are not incompetent in general (quite the opposite in fact), they simply lack competence <strong>for a given skill</strong> - usually on a rare topic.</p>\n\n<p>This means I do not patronize, talk down to them or speak to them with any disdain or disrespect (as some answerers have assumed). In fact, when the topic is in an area they have a degree of familiarity with, I find it very easy to get \"buy-in\" and support for my ideas. The only time I encounter any issues is when they lack the tools to assess my competence in a skill they lack themselves.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:"

                "content": " <p>The best way to prevent the race for a consultant is present a convincing business case that doesn't include a consultant.  From the business cases I've developed the main points are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Thoroughly define the problem being solved - Do not include your solution within the problem definition.  Concisely state the problem in business terms rather than technical terms.  For example \"Based on submitted bug reports customers find feature X confusing.  This confusion leads to frustration and reduces engagement in the overall product.\" is much better than \"The UI of feature X is flawed in these ways...\" because it states the problem in terms of business value.  In terms of solution ownership this shows that you understand the issue from a business perspective which is key since this is the same perspective that the decision makers will be looking from.  This will get everyone on the same page as to what the problem is from a high level.</li>\n<li>State your solution along with several other possible plans of\naction including the null case of doing nothing and state the\ncosts/benefits for each. For the above example I would go through\ndoing nothing, scrapping feature X, improving user training/help\ndocuments, reworking the UI on feature X.  This shows that you have\nlooked at the issue from several sides rather than immediately\nhopping onto your pet solution to the exclusion of all others.</li>\n<li>Show how you can effectively test if your solution eliminates the\nproblem.  This is huge in selling non-technical people on technical\nsolutions.  They want assurance that their investment is working so\nif you can give them concrete parameters and a way to measure\nsuccess.  If the definition of success is murky it is\npsychologically much harder to buy in to an idea.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My best real world example regarding going to a consultant is imagine you go to a mechanic for routine inspection.  If you hear \"Your garbles are cracked.  It's $800 to change them out.  Should I go ahead with that?\"  you are not going to be very confident in your ability to know if your money is being well spent and you may get a second opinion.  If you hear \"Your garbles are slightly cracked which could lead to your steering failing if you hit a pothole.  We could wait and see but that's risky.  I could weld across the crack for $500 but I wouldn't trust it long run.  It would be $800 to swap them out.  Swapping them out is the only way we can be sure they will hold.  What do you want me to do?\" you are going to feel more empowered to make a good decision even if the ultimate decision is the same.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note in a lot of places you are going to be fighting the culture to make headway on this.  Don't take it personally if the default answer is consultancy, just continue to work on your sales skills for selling your ideas to management.  When a decision goes against you on this remember that you may be missing pieces of the bigger picture (ie cost of failure may be higher than it generally appears due to interdependencies) or the opportunity cost for you doing this project rather than something else might be too high.</p>\n"
